5	just perfect for my skin fair and sensitive
5	i love setting powder , and am new to white setting powder thus , i was hoping to love this product , and happily , i do ! white setting powder does make one 's skin look a shade or two lighter than the underlying foundation , but i like that effect very much the powder takes the shine off , and keeps it off for hours this product meets and exceeds every hope i had for it highly recommend
5	if you love clarisonic like i do then you know have a fresh clean brush is essential these brushes are great and offer 4 different kind of cleanses the deep cleanse brush and the cashmere brush are my favorite this is an awesome kit and definitely worth the investment
4	jouer matte nude is a good match for my skin color and level of moisture i usually do n't use foundation but have been trying to make more of a habit of it at events and professional meetings it 's sometimes hard to find a good match for my light asian skin i 'd attended a sephora class on foundations and settled on using smashbox and bobbi brown 's bb cream spf 35 \( medium \) for the color match and the way that they feel on my skin the matte nude has the same comfortable feel it does n't feel like you 're wearing foundation but you have the added polish and spf protection i 've worn it on bare skin a very warm day in nyc \( high 70s \) and i did n't look shiny i'm very happy with jouer i 'd tried one of their foundations through one of those beauty boxes and liked it then this particular matte moisture tint \( nude \) is a particularly good fit for me
5	does the trick
4	i am always looking for an effective sunscreen that does double duty as a blemish cover up im impressed with the effectiveness of this dermablend blurring mousse its not too thick or clumpy and in my case does an excellent job of covering the age spots that have popped up without just under my hairline i like that there are shades that you can choose and its not a one size fits all like so many other sunscreen products you can choose a tone that is suitable for both daytime and nighttime wear the price point is a little higher than i usually choose but ive found a little goes a long way you certainly do n't slather it on in fact its basically a high end make up item its very natural looking not or
5	a reorder love these
5	i am an asian indian women with alot of hairs on my head , and the texture is quite coarse prior to using chi silk , i have tried a few similar products but they never worked the way chi silk works it makes hair so silky without making them greasy or reducing the volume down i really love this product , it 's keeper , definitely would recommend to all
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	i use this every day i would recommend this for anyone who has special needs with thinning hair , it has made a huge difference in my daily life
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
5	i have been using the stila convertible for a couple years now i started with poppy , moved to rose , then added others , fuchsia , peony is one of the last ones i on , because i did n't think it would suit my \( warm medium dark \) coloring i thought it would just be too light and a bit too muddy wrong wonderful cheek color on me very good discreet color that cheeks subtly for daytime i love how it matches delightfully with one of my fave lipstick dolce vita by nars , the pencil , lipstick and gloss this cheek color is perfect for that popular lip color as i said , i'm on the darker side of medium , olive toned i can wear some of the stila on my lips , the richer colors poppy and rose others are just too light but for fairer ladies , i think lots of these colors would work wonderfully i will add that having a quality brush makes application a dream i do n't use fingers to apply on cheeks i find my mac skunk brush \( and the mini skunk brush \) both apply beautifully , especially poppy which can be garish if the application is not it 's best to apply lightly and build up on the cheeks it 's best to use a lip brush to apply on the lips i love this product so much , i went to ebay to buy orchid , a discontinued color it 's the darkest deepest of the colors , deep berry it 's one of my , so a they do n't make fresh ones on a note for asian toned golden skinned warmer skinned ladies the is amazing i thought that color would be gross , but it totally adds light and glow to the skin \( as does , but that one is more like warm pink coral \) has orange tones , but it 's not clownish if there is warm gold in your natural skin tone , this will just light you up i love it for warm sunny days summer goes beautifully with mac \( \) i love that combo was one i tried that was a total fail on my coloring it 's definitely for fairer ladies anyway , i highly recommend this , e specially for aging dry skin i'm 52 , and used to always use powder blush but post menopause , my skin got crazy dry i can use foundation , the stila blush , and no powder , and i look fine happy blushing !
4	this cream is refreshing and easy to apply applied to clean skin in the morning , it leaves my skin feeling moist for the day it is non drying and the moisture provided leaves my skin fresher and younger looking
5	wonderful neutral color

5	goes on clear , like a hand lotion slight tingle but nothing major i did not use a bit and it did n't make a mess at all the scent is very subtle while i'm sure it 's best to keep it away from your eyes , it did n't burn them the tan starts coming on pretty quickly it 's almost like magic not a fake looking tan either only negatives i can think of is that the directions were pretty much non existent on the tube that i received , and it 's a touch pricy but it 's an excellent product , very possibly one of the best 5 stars
5	the of this serum means you have to carefully measure your squirts a little dab really will do that is my only complaint i have a for serums , i love them , especially anything with hyaluronic acid , and vichy has amazing products vine first introduced me to them , and now they are in cvs pharmacy after using this serum for ten days , i can honestly say it works i used to have noticeable worry lines on my forehead and they have disappeared now i use this in conjunction with sunscreen with oil and also black seed oil , and that is my skin care triple threat ! my lower face , and neck also look noticeably smoother
5	if this raw spirit fragrance bears any to the island of \( as suggested in the product description \) i should visit soon i love it and as has been stated about one particular product raw spirit may not be easy to describe but youll surely love it when you smell it about an hour before the start of the super bowl last evening i showered and stepped out for a quick trip to the supermarket \( less than two blocks away \) to pick up some of the usual stuff that go with watching the game it was quite filled with shoppers i sprayed on raw and hoped someone would notice sure enough a couple was tempted to start a conversation that became an description of my smell the lady guessed its a french product her man said german i ordered raw spirit for my lady but i am going to keep it for myself its unisex after all
4	instead of my having to use 2 products , actually 3 sometimes , i am trying this i 've heard of the company but have never tried anything of theirs this is a light feeling cleanser that you can use to wipe away your eye make up too says usable for eye area and sensitive skin lastly , includes a toner there is no rinsing required apply with from what i can from ingredients , besides the vichy natural spa water there is shea butter , liquid , liquid cocoa something this really does feel soothing and my face has not broken out the biggest surprise for me is that there is perfume fragrance to this is that a little weird or just my thought \? to me it smells kind of like eternity ! i mean , love the smell but wow , surprised me that perfume is an ingredient
4	nail polish works great very lasting cool colors as well really like this brand and will try other colors
5	luv this brand
5	i love this stuff , i use it night after i have used my shower face brush the skin on my face arms and hands is much better in a week my hands were looking very worn , now they look nice and feel smooth
5	great bright red color i also really like layered with cake pop
4	this is a good powder compliment to whatever liquid foundation you already use it covers well on top of liquid foundation , but ca n't really be used on its own , at least not for me over tip of my freckles it 's light and airy and the shades are true to their picture , which is great bc online you never know i have sensitive skin and this did not irritate me at all overall , good powder for a shiny nose and to blend with liquid foundation
4	very lovely light soft color with sparkle , used it over another color as this was very light shellac is the way to go , lasts at least two weeks and then some
4	i have been using this product for about 6 months and it does seem to have made a slight difference in the tone and texture of my skin wrinkles seem smoother and redness dark spots seem not as bad but i was really hoping for more of a change after 6 months the cream goes on smooth and did n't cause any issues with my skin having allergies to it overall i was pleased but hoped for more of difference at this price point i had another similarly priced cream that make more of a difference
4	this is pretty good cleaner , it cleanses my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed and moisturized my skin sometimes reacts to cleansers but i have not experienced any reaction after using this cleanser it seems like a good option but would not be my first pick because the price is kind of high for this small bottle
5	la roche posay makes excellent beauty products this toleriane teint mattifying mousse foundation in golden beige is not my color i am a fair or light in my skin tone however , i tried it on my arm and then took a washcloth and brushed most of it off lo and behold , it suited me quite well additionally , the remainder was almost impossible to wash off \( in a good way \) i will definitely try buying this in fair to the matte , smooth look of my skin it is wonderful
4	for facial scrubs this one is pretty good it does n't have a lot of tiny scrubbing particles but you can certainly feel them as you wash your face i used it exactly as directed and the overall process is easy only a small amount is needed and it lathers just a little bit rinsing all the particles off takes several splashes , but it seems to clean everything off very well l still had to use a moisturizer afterwards because my skin felt tight after patting dry with a towel it 's kind of expensive , but i think it will last a long time as of this review it costs 21 63 i hope after many uses i will notice a smoothness in those areas that have a bit of sun damage and the skin is dryer and a little
4	fresh , clean and a great way to top off a good cleansing regime perfect end of day cleansing when with seaweed soap
5	oh my goodness , this stuff smells amazing it needs to be a cologne , not just a hair product it 's sort of woodsy and very masculine it 's also quite a strong fragrance , so if you 're sensitive to scents or like to wear body fragrance , you will not like this the clay has an interesting texture finish while it looks to be a jar of greasy stuff , it 's very matte and is excellent for keeping the hair in place you do n't get a huge amount , but unless you glob on the product , this could easily last 6 months the packaging is nice too a
4	so dry soooo , sooo , sooo dry if you have oily skin , absolutely give this a try if your skin is combo or dry , prep your skin exfoliate , moisturize , throw on some rose water then let this warm on your skin \( or in your hand \) before you try blending it my skin is combo dry and this formula was much hard to work with than i anticipated \( also , use a setting powder , it , , helps it look less dry \) as for coverage , i would describe this as fair to good , but far from exceptional i confess that i was expecting more from this brand 's reputation amazon has given me the option to try a wide variety of demablend products , and with the exception of the setting powders and possibly the pigment drops , there 's really nothing i 've tried that i think i would try again the coverage has \( on none of them \) met the hype of the brand 's reputation they 've been above average \( compared to products from other brands \) , but they are n't amazing and i 've found almost every product to be drying all color images for this brand look lighter than the color in person i would suggest you seek out additional color images \( or visit a cosmetic counter \) before deciding on your color selection the products did not irritate my sensitive skin beyond the discomfort of the dryness
3	this is a very good product as a moisturizer , it is first class just using a little bit on my face and neck makes a difference that i can feel almost immediately and as a sun block it also works well i'm outdoors a lot and this definitely keeps the burn away it 's easy to apply and the scent is subtle so i have no complaints about the product itself i'm giving this three stars due to the price i 've used comparable products from nivea and neutrogena that work almost as well and that are way less expensive than this cream that said , my skin has never been particularly sensitive , and this cream might work better for folks with those issues if you have sensitive skin and you 're looking for a combo moisturizer sun block that works well for you , then give this a try if it works well for you , then it 's worth the extra cash for my skin , i ca n't really say that it is the good thing about this cream is that a little goes a long way , but , even so , it 's pretty pricey
5	this is a cooling , creamy balm that you apply to your and muscle dragon ice feels cooling and mildly sinks in without smelling like a bomb there are a variety of ingredients and the recommendation to apply it a few times over the day i am good with that for light duty muscle or joint in my legs , dragon ice is doing the trick and the name is cool too ! \)
5	essie does deep pink better than anyone we know ! this color is perfect for the beach or the bistro go for it !
5	as advertised , received quickly !
3	this is just okay the color and coverage are nice , and it does a decent job of blocking out what you 're trying to cover up , but i feel like it 's just too oily to really use it my skin is not liking it all that much i do n't think a concealer is really a great plan if it makes you break out and leaves you with more things to conceal
5	this stuff is like botox in a jar amazing !
5	great color , bright , easily removed with acetone
5	i love l'occitane shea butter hand cream ! what a great product ! very rich but absorbs well into my skin ! works wonders for my hands , elbows , or anywhere the skin is super dry ! i will be buying it again along with other products from their company !
5	lovely color ! soft , pretty , slightly iridescent , more on the mauve side than pink great coverage
1	do t love the color too much
3	i used to have normal combination skin which has become drier over time therefore , i 've progressed to gentler products to wash my face , and have moved to cream based cleansers for the most part , but which still require water to finish this product is extremely smooth in texture , is not runny , but not solid more like a light lotion , and it has a somewhat strong \( i could still smell it on my face after it dried \) , but not unpleasant floral fragrance the front of the tube says it is a one step cleanser sensitive skin 1 cleaning milk 2 toner , 3 eye make up remover i put this on my unwashed made up face at the end of the day , as the directions say you can do , and it did glide on very easily i wiped it off with a pad , and it removed my eye makeup with no problem , and most of my foundation looked to be removed as well my face felt very moist and soft \( not oily \) , and it dried to normal skin texture after about two minutes after about ten minutes , my face felt a bit sensitive stinging a bit , and i could still smell the product , so i rinsed my face well with water update maybe 1 2 hr later this maybe an issue , but my face feels warm and red , and now also a bit tingly \( not in a good way \) i'm going to wash this off with soap , as i guess i'm one of the few that might be having a bad reaction to the cream update 2 i reviewed a newer version of this product nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy puret thermale 3 in 1 one step facial cleanser 11 64 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy puret thermale 3 in 1 one step facial cleanser , 11 64 fl oz a , which seems to have removed the shea butter in the ingredient list , and reduced the parfum concentration from ingredient number 6 in this version , to the last ingredient in the newer version i gave the new \( larger \) size a 5 star , because it kept \( for me \) all the good traits of this product , while reducing the strong smell and irritation factor
3	dermablend 's smooth liquid camo \( medium to high coverage \) was simply okay the largest issue for me was the color of the liquid foundation the color was too dark and orange for pale skin further , the weight of the product was too heavy unfortunately , the heaviness of the foundation was difficult to apply and looked garish however , the liquid foundation did provide the medium to high coverage that it advertised in addition , i found the price reasonable
5	works as described
4	this is a really helpful product for my fine hair i wish there was an easier way to apply other than shaking from the bottle
5	this product is awesome i have been using it for myself and also for my newborn baby if you or your baby have a sensitive skin this is the product to get i'm using many product of that brand for myself and and my baby and i always been satisfied
5	this effaclar purifying foaming gel cleanser works really well at removing all my make up it foams up nicely and makes a good lather it has a nice light clean scent and easily rinses off with water i have sensitive combination skin and it felt less oily but not overly drying and best of all did not break me out or make my face feel all red , itchy or tight feeling the pump bottle worked well and dispensed the perfect amount i like that this product is soap free , alcohol free , oil free and paraben free
5	excellent , thank you ! ! !
5	great foundation if you have normal oily skin it great quality and goes on easily my \( sp \) recommended this product and i can say it has truly been wonderful i use this and sometimes the compact to keep it switched up a bit the product is good for your skin and provides great coverage it goes on very mat but when your natural skin oils it looks great i highly recommend this product
5	i'm giving this cologne 5 stars based on the fact that my husband likes it personally , it 's a little , the word me , maybe sandlewood , earthy to me i'm a fan of floral colognes like your dolce light blue or your issey my husband reminded me that he likes to change up every now and then and this was a nice change for him can you tell i buy most of his cologne \? it comes in nice smokey gray bottle and is 3 5 ounces there 's not much more to say about it
3	it hydrated my lips but the color was a bit intense lol \( talk about pigmented \) so i had to be careful next time i 'll just order a natural color if you want a chapstick a color then get wild rose ! i
4	as i mentioned in my last review , i have a serious issue with dry skin during the winter i did n't realize the moisturizer in this set was the same as the single one i had ordered as well ah well i guess i'm just set on facial moisturizers for life or maybe i can gift the other one ! again , i did n't realize this set was geared towards men but it 's okay ! the face wash is nice using female products sometimes is a hassle since you do n't know what things will smell like \( like my simple exfoliate smells like really strong hair dye \) or how your skin will react to the product i like how the face wash did n't dry out my skin nor did it have any strange strong smell also this bottle will last me a good amount of time ! the toner i do n't use too often since i'm not exactly sure what it 's for and because my skin gets really dry i'm scared that it will dry it out even more or you know sting since i'm not sure if my skin has cracked or not but i do love the scent of this ! again , the bottle is a good amount so it 'll last you awhile i 've already reviewed the moisturizer on it 's own individual page overall i'm pretty happy with this set !
1	seems to help a little very liquidy though be careful or way too much comes out
4	the scent is a bit strong , and definitely noticeable , so if you 're looking to not be scented , i would avoid the moisturizer workers really well , feels nice and goes on well if you like the smell \( and it 's a nice smell \) , then this is great
5	there are only two sunscreens on this planet that i will put on my sensitive , breakout prone combination skin uv aqua rich , and this , the la roche posay anthelios mineral tinted sunscreen this stuff is seriously incredible the first time i tried this particular product i was a bit dubious when it came to the fact that it 's tinted , even though it claimed it was a universal tint tinted anything other than foundations typically give my skin an unflattering orange or pink tint amazingly , this is not the case with this product at all ! at first it seemed like it would be too dark when searching it in my wrist , but when applying to my face for the first time i noticed how the tint seemed to just disappear into my skin , blending and with my skin tone to create a sheer and even coverage that makes my skin look like my skin , but better ! it 's absolutely beautiful ! it 's perfect for the days you do n't want to wear makeup but need spf and want your skin to look even this product is so light and non greasy , you do n't even feel like you have anything on your skin it also does not the makeup application process , nor does it make makeup applied on top heavier , cakey or blotchy it almost acts like a primer moisturizer bb cream , but almost in that it 's even lighter than any primer , moisturizer or bb cream that i 've ever used under makeup it 's not drying , nor does the tint look like makeup even when you have dry patches that would normally cause a product to cling or look flakey it 's truly beautiful on the liquid itself is quite runny so you have to use some dispensing from the bottle i use the back of my hand as the surface to dispense the product onto after shaking up really well , i 'll usually use about to dime size squirts or product to evenly distribute and spread into my face and neck after it sets and absorbs , that 's when it becomes transfer proof and that 's when i begin my normal foundation application \( if i'm doing it at all \) this product does n't leave you matte , but it does n't leave you shiny either it 's somewhere in between the two this spf is also effective i live in and since using this sunscreen , i have not once been burned or even gotten slightly pink while out an about granted , it 's full on summer here so i'm typically not outdoors for hours on end it 's waterproof which is great for sweating in this humidity , and my skin looks fab all day long , with or without makeup sometimes i just use this and maybe spot conceal and use a touch of powder on top to mattify it is a bit in the pricey side , especially for the size , however i feel like the price is completely reflective of its quality and performance and is ultimately completely worth it it has never caused me to break out and finding something that does n't is a miracle in itself much less a sunscreen ! i can definitely see where this tint could be considered universal but if you 're concerned about how it will actually look on your skin you might want to go seek out a la roche posay display and try the tester before purchasing i will say though that testing it on your hand or wrist is very different than actually putting it on your face and the result is a bit different i ca n't really explain it but when i first swatches it it looked a bit dark for my skin , but upon applying it to my face it was perfect i highly highly recommend this product i love la roche posay 's products and this sunscreen has just been everything i 've come to expect from this brand
5	nice
5	the obliphica professional seaberry conditioner comes in a colorful bottle with a hand pump using the pump , it easily from the bottle it has a light color and pleasant scent the conditioner has to some extent smoothed out my , but has left my hair soft and clean i recommend it
1	this review is from clarisonic replacement brush head twin pack for acne cleansing \( \) ordered the deep pore cleansing brushes and some one threw the wrong brushes into the box well happen amazon said this is not from and caused me loads of grief and in trying to their error calls , letters and a trip to the post office not what i expected from you guys i bought tons of stuff and wonder why your customer service was non existent now \? i think you owe me buyer beware is it amazon or a sub \? big difference in how you are treated
5	i love l'occitane men 's soaps and colognes , so when i saw this cream , i asked my wife if she would try it she agreed , and really likes the visible difference it 's made on her facial skin she 's been using it on her neck and face , after washing her face and before applying her makeup in the mornings after about a week of using it once a day , it 's improved the texture of her skin , giving it a much softer feel and smoother look compared to a department store hyper allergenic brand she had been using for years , she feels it is as good , if not better it is made with immortelle essential oils , which are rich in active molecules that have anti aging beauty results , from a sustainable and organic in in addition , the cream was developed under dermatological , and is proven to be non comedogenic therefore , my wife highly recommends the immortelle precious cream
5	makes my hair look full
5	this is a gorgeous palette in a beautiful case it has a nice large mirror and the shades are very generously sized the gold highlighter stick is an added bonus there is one shimmer bronzer and 2 matte shades that work well with neutral to yellow skin tones the texture is very creamy and pigmented , it 's really great quality and i was very pleased when i tried them on the product picture does not really represent the shades very well , so i have taken some pics this is a nice contouring palette that will last some time as there is a lot of product in here the shades also work perfectly for a bare look natural eyeshadow and the gold highlighter for the brow bone
1	i the claim of being super shiny these polishes are no more shiny than any other do n't buy the hype opi i expect more of them
4	i would never have thought that i could put white powder on my face and not look like a ! i did n't use the enclosed puff i applied over foundation using a brush use a light hand and brush away any white residue that remains i 've also applied it over l'oreal 's visible lift radiance booster , which i use alone sometimes when i'm just running out to the post office , or trying on clothes at the store and do n't want to get makeup on things the setting powder takes away the shine of the l'oreal primer so , now i'm using green primer \( to neutralize redness \) and white powder what next \? ! \? i have very fair skin , so the white setting powder blends well i do n't know how it would work on darker or more olive complexions i love that the mirror on the compact is large you can see your whole face in it a lot of cosmetics companies are using smaller mirrors in their compacts , i suppose to save money
5	my new favorite color this coral is a little sparkly , but without the excessive glitter
4	i just wish the lip pencil would stay on my lips longer it is a nice color but a little lighter than i expected however , it does look quite good on me and i did reorder it
4	works well , rough but not too rough skin feels fresh after using it i have tried a lot of bj 's products with mixed results , but this is one of my favorite
2	too drying and not effective
4	when i first put this product on my face , it made my face look really wet which is not a quality i seek i always use loose powder , and so i covered the product with loose powder and wondered if that would take away the look that the product touts but then i realized that , after the powder , what remained was a little or sparkle i have friends who say that women of a certain age \( actually over 25 or so \) should never sparkle or use makeup with glitter in it , so i'm not sure that they would say this product with its sparkle is appropriate for me , but i love sparkle and glitter and refuse to with the rules of the senior fashion so , i give this product a four for how it looks if it actually has the beneficial effects it claims , all the better
4	my teen daughter and i use this and it 's very good i do n't wear a lot of makeup but teen girl does and she uses it as a second rinse i use it to leave my face with a nice clean feeling before bed and i love that it does n't dry out my old mom skin it 's very very gentle and does n't aggravate acne nor my dry , super sensitive skin i have allergies and product sensitivities and i 've not had any problems the best part is the size and the fact that it 's a pump teen girl tends to it and go through products like crazy the pump has acted to help her get the right amount on her cotton pads and this size is lasting very well
5	i felt that this powder foundation applied easily on my face and went on evenly i liked the shade and it looked great
3	this is a good lotion if you have any sensitivity or allergic reaction to strong scents this lotion is completely scentless so that 's a plus however , i did n't like that it 's not a very good absorbing lotion i put it on , rubbed my hands together and about a minute later , my hands felt really greasy , like the lotion was sitting on top of my skin i did n't like that at all it eventually feel better but i did n't like how long it took before i did n't feel greasy
4	i like the red ones but the set may be a waste , since i do n't use the larger body discs hope they sell sets with just the small ones for face
2	i could n't wait to get this lip butter after hearing so many people rave about how good they were i must say i was n't impressed , especially for the price ! i will stick to my nivea lip butters
3	i had some difficulty getting the clippers to work properly i 've now figured things out the quality is very nice it clips better than my 99 cent trim once you get the thing properly but the price is quite expensive , despite the nice quality otherwise i'm also not sure how durable the fingernail clippers will be time will tell 3 stars based mostly on price and some difficulty with the clippers
5	this is my third or fourth time ordering this product i love using it as a base coat for manicures , and i keep it on my nails all of the time even without a manicure on top it really helps keep nails strong and prevents peeling i highly recommend this product it sells in retail stores for nearly twice the price that i consistently find on amazon
5	very nice full coverage foundation , conceals my freckles and other blemishes well and stays on all day recommended
5	best product
5	if you like moisturizers that contain shea butter , you will most likely love this jack black product let 's start with the bottle , which is a pretty dark blue plastic the pump on the bottle has a good sized top , and the lotion flows easily from the very first pump so , good packaging the lotion itself is lightweight , and does not have a heavy or greasy feel it has a fairly thin consistency , and starts out white in color as you smooth it over the skin , it turns to a clear emulsion which sinks right in the moisture lasts for hours , and leaves a nice sheen on the skin besides shea butter , the product contains coffee seed oil and organic green tea , which the manufacturer says are antioxidants to help firm skin for improved tone and texture it also contains , olive fruit , and argan oil it does not contain parabens , and is vegan the scent is clean and light , fades quickly , and is suitable for men or women you can either apply the lotion after showering or bathing after drying off , or , you can apply it to slightly moist skin , and wait for it to dry down \( applying it to damp skin is supposed to give maximum moisturization \( i apply it to dry skin \) while not inexpensive , the bottle is a generous 12 fl oz , which should last for a decent amount of time , since it spreads so easily , and because you do n't need much to cover large areas \( example pump out an amount that is just slightly larger than a quarter , and you have enough to moisturize both arms and hands \) with winter on the way , this is a moisturizer i 'll use often
3	it 's ok as a moisturizer to relieve the feeling of tightness , but did n't do anything for puffiness or wrinkles in fact after a few hours this made my undereye skin feel tight and look crepey not a repurchase
5	i am almost 50 years old suddenly my skin started breaks out i bought it and it works ! ! it cleared my skin nicely i run out on the cleanser and used another line one i had of course my skin broke out i run to my and reorder it
5	i am always searching for something better for my complexion something that will deliver the results that it promises i think this is the product that truly does that at least it 's working great for me i 've been using this cream nightly \( and sometimes in the morning because i like it so much ! \) for seven days i love the simple packaging and design i really like the container is designed and how it dispenses the cream you just pop off the top cap , then press down on the top of the container , and the cream comes out right in the center in the exact amount you need for your face and neck \( with maybe a bit to spare for your hands and or chest area \) this is a big thing for me because there 's no excess cream it wo n't come out too fast or too slow and it 's not too thick or too thin you get the exact amount you need the scent is wonderful ! it 's a clean , crisp scent that lingers for an hour or two , but it 's not strong at all in my opinion i do n't think it 's a floral scent it 's more clean and fresh it absorbs nicely into my skin , not feeling greasy at all the results after about five days were noticeable with respect to the brightening and evening of my skin tone i also have a small sun spot on my cheek which has become noticeably lighter as well by the day , i have been going without foundation ! i have n't done this in years and i'm in my early 50 's i do still put a bit of loose powder on my nose because of my pores i'm not sure which of the ingredients \( or if it 's a combination \) that is contributing to this , but since i 've used a ton of face creams with vitamin c , and they have n't done much , i'm guessing it 's not that i did a bit of research on extract and flower and i found that the is supposed to reduce signs of premature aging and the is supposed to slow down aging , smooth skin , and reduce wrinkles it is also supposed to lighten skin although i have not seen any wrinkle improvement in my skin , i still love this cream and will be purchasing it , as long as i continue to maintain the results i 've already achieved and or see additional improvement in my skin who knows , with a little more time , i may see those wrinkles start to smooth out \)
4	this cream is more than a moisturizer , as it is designed to help brighten skin and reduce brown spots i found that it feels good on my skin , and i like the scent several reviewers commented that it had a strong floral scent , which i find surprising because i consider it to be a light , clean scent there is a hint of floral but i do n't find it to be strong the container is designed to release a small amount of cream instead of opening the lid and exposing the cream to light , which can degrade the ingredients and make it less effective when i initially removed the lid , i removed the entire lid be aware that only the top part should open also , when you depress the inner lid , it will release too much cream at once if you are not careful a tiny bit goes a long way ! h2o plus recommends using it along with the serum for best results however , they do not say it will not work without the serum vitamin c is an ingredient in many similar creams that promise to brighten and lighten the product claims to be backed by clinical studies proving it works for some reason , they do n't provide any other details about the study other than it works how long does it take to work \? how many were there \? what were their ages \? how much will it brighten or lighten \? is there a 50 improvement \? 10 improvement \? 1 improvement \? did any experience problems and drop out before the study completed \? were the studies published and peer reviewed for \? i contacted the company and asked for further information about the clinical studies they advertised they responded to explain that they do not share their studies and would only say the study lasted 6 weeks and had great results i have bought a variety of h2o products over the years , and especially love their body butters i would have been so happy if they had given me a real answer at the end of the day , this is a good quality moisturizer that makes my skin feel good it 's not the best jar on my shelf , but it 's nice
2	i had hoped based on the reviews it would clear up some body acne from workouts and hormones it did seen to help initially but no long term solution or cure for the price i really it to be bummer it does smell nice though
5	gorgeous ! light , it looks very natural ! ! very good sp ! one of the best products foundation sp blocker and moisturizer ! ! i recommend it strongly ! !
4	i 've used a lot of facial products over the years but facial toner is n't typically one of them when i was in college i used a toner which left me with a bad allergic reaction that sent me to a dermatologist while i 've used a burt 's bees toner with results in recent years that has been it regarding my toner experience if you think the use of toner eliminates the need for washing your face , think again before using this product thoroughly wash and rinse your face first following directions apply this to a cotton pad and cover the face it does a nice job and leaves the face somewhat tingly and fresh i liked it though i cannot say i think it removed dirt or skin impurities or even excess make up i do n't usually use a lot of make up and i use a charcoal soap to clean my skin which takes care of all dirt very nicely regardless , i liked this toner if only for its tingly feeling and astringent properties it did not leave my skin feeling dry nor did i have an allergic reaction to it overall it was a nice pampering product that left my skin feeling both fresh and clean i 'd recommend it for anyone who uses make up daily and needs to thoroughly cleanse their skin
5	none better than l'occitane foot and hand creams !
5	i only cleanse my face with salicylic acid 2 ive tried other cleansers but they do not work i see a dermatologist and sleep with medicated lotion that is prescribed but need to have my face clean prior i was shocked when i used this my face felt so clean ! i think it smells fresh as well i do not use it in the shower though , there is not much at 4 oz and but it does go a long way i use mine at the sink at night and just place a dab on my face sponge i can literally feel it cleaning my skin , after my skin feels tight and clean sometimes i have to use a toner to remove leftover residue , not with this cleanser this is my favorite cleanser at the moment i do think it is pricey though i use it two or three times a week to make it last i noticed there is another page for this item that is significantly cheaper , not sure why it might be pricey but once you see how well it works , you will be addicted too
5	i stumbled on pevonia a few years ago and just love it i have extremely sensitive skin and used the pevonia roseacea line for quite a while i have struggled with finding an enzyme or exfoliating treatment that does n't leave me just raw with red skin this is a very gentle enzyme cream mask , it does n't have much of an odor , and it is so easy to use in the shower \( jump in , let the steam work for a minute , put it on , let it sit for a couple minutes , rinse it off \) this and the pevonia c complexe are the two skin care items i splurge on i have tried philosophy , kate , murad , dermalogica , burt 's bees multiple higher end skin care lines and many from the drug store as well and this has worked the best for me and my sensitive skin i would suggest this product to anybody a little bit of this goes a long way so it lasts quite a while if using two times per week
4	my 17 year old has been struggling with acne for a while now but resists using most products because she is very sensitive to how various products smell she 's also not very consistent in sticking with a skin care routine but had shown some improvement using a 3 step skin care line however , the acne kept returning or would just flare up suddenly i had her replace the toner she was using with this effaclar clarifying solution and , after a couple of weeks of nightly use , her skin looks smoother and calmer areas that are particularly breakout prone have started to heal she has fair skin but is n't too sensitive so has had no issues with dry or flaky skin she does still use her regular face soap and then follows the toner with a light moisturizer i think the salicylic acid provided just the boost her routine needed to clear up those stubborn areas i plan on replacing this for her when it runs out rather than have her return to what she was using
5	love this essie color ! essie polishes are some of my favorite nail polishes they self level better than any nail polish i have ever tried they coat very well , and for the majority of the colors essie nail polishes are very opaque they dry very quickly as well this color is a very cheery , vibrant sky blue almost completely opaque with only one coat one of my all time favorites !
5	this skin cream has light texture and is non greasy and \( does n't block the pores \) it has a pleasant scent , though burns lightly when i apply it to my face i found that it absorbs well , and leaves the skin feeling softer and nicer the tube is very small though \( only 1 76 ounces \) , so you have to stay with it overall , if you can tolerate the hefty price tag and the small tube , this is a high quality skin cream
5	i am really pleased with the great results i'm getting with h2o eucalyptus aloe shampoo h2o is the official shampoo used on disney which a lot of positives about the brand i believe that anyone who wants a fuller , cleaner and more pleasant head of hair should give h20 a try i'm a man who is definitely not a , but i felt that i had to snap a photo i have naturally curly hair but getting the look i want depends a lot on using the right shampoo as you can see , h20 gifted me a great hair day ! there is something about the eucalyptus and aloe that is totally agreeable to me all i did was use h20 and rinse with conditioner nothing more my hair responded with plenty of shine , bounce and texture i suspect that if h20 worked this well for me a 50 something geezer with thinning hair then it should work well for just about anyone else i highly recommend h20 to everyone
4	i have relatively dry skin and i 've never used any kind of oil for it i was a bit hesitant to try this , especially after rubbing some on my hand and seeing how much it and is , well , oily but when used in the way that the instructions suggest rubbing in light circles , rinsing off with warm water and then patting dry the result is actually refreshing with a nice that keeps my skin feeling less dry the next day there 's still something weird about putting oil on my face that i have n't warmed up to but i like this stuff
5	perfect for touch ups when you do n't want to get a manicure every day for 10 , even better for those with real nails
3	i bought some vinylux to try and this is no reflection on this particular product , but on vinylux in general it just does n't work chipped or peeled off entirely after one day it 's no better than regular nail polish my opi stays on longer
5	i purchased this through a television shopping channel and am very pleased with it i have never been enough to use a curling iron or curling wand without burning either myself or my hair the makes curling my hair easy you just choose either l \( left \) or r \( right \) for the side of the head you are working on , place your hair in the about two inches from the bottom of your hair and press the button the hair winds around the barrel until you let go of the button when you are ready to release the hair just simply push the clamp and release it 's that easy let the hair cool down a bit before running your fingers through it and it will turn out great the has a temperature control setting allowing you to adjust it from up to 450 degrees to shut it off just hold down the power button until it powers down to me the proof is in the pudding so to speak after i started using this i received so many compliments about my hair that seals the deal for me amazing product
4	this powder goes on smooth it does n't look caked on or settle into fine lines like other matte powders tend to do the multi color blend seems to give it a more natural look on the skin which is exactly what i'm looking for in a foundation
1	dries the crap out of your hair
5	excellent i recommend shipping on time , exceeded my expectations ! ! ! very good
3	this lily of the valley hand therapy lotion smells good , is not greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly the scent stays with me quite a while even after washing my hands the scent lingers to me though it does n't seem really moisturizing i did n't realize how small a container 9 fl oz is this is a good size for me to keep in my pack for the price i think there should be more in the tube than less than an ounce it wo n't last very long
1	i bought this product because it is listed as a lotion for rosacea , and dry , sensitive skin it is not a lotion it is a non spray of very watery , milky liquid i am returning this , and would not purchase this again i also do n't like the vendors return policy of return within 7 days of purchase , less fee the return time expires before the product is received , ridiculous
4	so , i really like this bronzer it is packaged really nicely , with the brush fitting into the bottom compartment the bronzer applies nicely and blends very well i just wish i got a darker color this one is exactly the same color as my skin , making it a better finishing powder it is matte , with no shine , which i like i'm over all the shine this is an excellent product that i will try in a darker shade , while i use this over my concealer
5	my wife used this , and was pleased with this product since it has improved the appearance of her skin her skin is oily and has been less elastic as she got older she uses several skin care products and has added this one in the morning as an exfoliator to improve skin quality and appearance she uses a small amount and uses other products over it it is not heavy and a small amount is sufficient it is an excellent quality product and will now try other products from obagi
2	too many coats have to be applied to get the color i was disappointed when i had to keep reappling polish is very thin
5	here 's another over sized tube of the rich , ahava foot cream one of the thickest most luxuriant such creams on the market a little goes a very long way and in this package , you get 5 4 fluid ounces , compared with the usual 3 4 ounce ahava size and ahava foot cream is not just good for feet it 's great for elbows , hands , and so on try some you 'll love it
5	if you need to order a product thru the luxury brand , make sure to order this first it 's a fun box to get i wish the had more of these types of boxes do n't forget to use your credit and order the item you want i just wish they would consider lancme mascara as a luxury brand
3	this thick clay mask goes on grey and dries a somewhat soft green it easily washes off once dry and skin is left feeling soft it has an scent that kind of smells like mushroom unfortunately , the scent is very strong and stays with you for awhile since your nose is right there in the middle so while i enjoy the results of the mask , i find i just do n't want to use it because the scent is unpleasant to me
4	not a bad sample too many single use samples , not enough to evaluate product
4	i was excited to try this because typically my lipsticks have always come in a thicker bullet and this thinner lipstick seemed like it would be easier to apply without a lip brush functionally , i liked this lipstick it does apply easily straight from the tube it feels moisturizing and it 's forgiving i find it does n't call attention to lip dryness or lines \( probably due to the matte finish \) and it wears well it 's pretty opaque and lasts through eating an drinking but the color that i was n't a fan of i feel the need to mention that i generally love bold lip colors my collection has various purples , a blue lipstick , funky oranges , metallics , etc i'm very open to color as long as it 's flattering but this just was n't i could n't find many real life swatches of this color before ordering so i had no idea what to expect i thought the shade on amazon looked nice a very neutral red , almost rose but it 's clearly because the real life color looks nothing like that it 's more of a true bright red , but not one that was particularly flattering with my light medium neutral toned skin , ashy blonde hair , and gray eyes generally because my skin is pretty neutral i can pull off both warm and cool colors and do n't find that many lipsticks just seem off , but for whatever reason this did i'm torn on how to rate this because the formula is 5 stars in my book , but the color is just not for me and is not accurately represented here i wish there were more real life swatches available because i do think this lipstick is excellent , it 's just a matter of finding the color that 's right for you
5	pretty color , very pink !
5	nice color for summer essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping would recommend essie polish great deal
3	the color was darker than i expected i know it 's hard to tell on the computer what a product will look like in person , but i thought this would be a lighter shade than it turned out to be \( not what i expected a honey beige to be \) i like that it is fragrance free the product claims to be hydrating , however i did not find that it did any difference in terms of hydration than my current foundation i have very dry skin , so maybe it will work better for someone who is not starting out with dry skin to begin with it 's a small \( 1 fl oz \) squeeze tube , that would be good for traveling , but it 's pricey for a foundation i suggest that you take a look at the shades of this product in a store to see which one is right for you , then you can go back online to compare pricing
5	unlike other products that i 've tried , this one actually improved both my lashes and brows as mine were quite skimpy , it took 2 3 months , with twice a day applications , to see real change but it was well worth it and i will continue using this product
5	nice color , good product
5	great
5	i like this cleanser my face feels very clean after using it , but does n't feel dry
4	i 've reviewed other baxter products and so far i find them to be a good line the advantage of this moisturizer is that it is subtle , easily and quite smooth feeling nice hydration
5	good product
4	i 've just come to accept the fact that all liquid lipsticks are super drying for me regardless of how much i exfoliate or moisturize with that in mind , this product performs on par it 's drying but the color lasts for ages \( it 's a pain to remove \) , does n't transfer \( unless you 're eating something oily \) but looks stunning my only real complaint is the doe foot applicator i never really have a problem with applicators like this but for some reason this one is really difficult to use either is comes out with a ton of product or next to none very weird this issue is easily remedied by just using a lip brush but that would make touch up throughout the day difficult \( if touch ups were needed \)
4	this is a nice stiff brush that you can use for base make up as well as powder blush i brushed around my eyes before applying make up to exfoliate although it does n't seem like it 's doing much , the bristles are stiff enough to exfoliate the top layer of the delicate eye skin when applying the base make up i rotated the brush in a circular motion , which leaves the skin looking very smooth after brushing off the make up onto a paper towel , i swirled the brush into powder blusher and brushed from the apples of my cheeks upward toward the hair line it gives just a hint of color , which is how i like to wear my make up it really is a brush that can be used for more than one type of make up it would be a good companion for a travel case , since you would only need the one brush
5	i used this last night for the first time after coming back from a my feet were disgusting in fact , they 're disgusting a lot of the time because i hate wearing shoes pedicures usually do the trick , but i ca n't afford to get a pedicure a week this little device worked really well there 's not assembly all you have to do is put in the included batteries and take the protective covering off and you 're ready to roll it felt really good on my feet you can see the gross dry skin flaking off as you roll over your feet i used the course roller because my feet were so gross , but i imagine if i keep up with this , the fine one will do the trick when i was finished , my feet were truly soft and smooth the device is small so you can pack it to take on vacation , it in a drawer , put it in your purse \( if you need to , i guess \) i think for what it does , it 's worth the price i mean , 25 a pop for a pedicure , or 30 for something you can use over and over to make your feet feel nice i really have nothing bad to say about this product i highly recommend it for women who ca n't afford or are too busy to get routine pedicures
5	love all the pca products i have purchased ! i can see a difference within a few weeks of starting to use it the prices seem to have gone up on some products since my last purchase a bit pricey
4	this full coverage sunscreen has many fine qualities the color is very nice , though with maybe a hint too much orange for me it blends beautifully and covers very well i have a on my face that it mostly covered , but it did very well relative to other i 've tried i used it on my face , one hand and wrist i was not only impressed by the color and coverage , but by how water resistant it was i wore it on my face and had to wash it off with a little soap or makeup remover after about six hours \( i tried both they both worked \) on my hand it lasted just a few hours , but i washed my hands several times and was impressed by how long it did there is no smell it blends well but you can use a drop of water to help it too it does not make your skin greasy , oily or dry it has a very natural look and feel i love that it 's spf 30 i only wear high ish spf skin products anymore
4	i have a rosy patch that i sometimes get in the winter it is only on the left said of my face and it is just a patch of pink that doesnt go away in the warmth i do think it is funny that i only get this patch in the winter i have used this against this problem and it has worked fine , even though i have been outdoors in cold for several hours at some point , winter will arrive in for real , and that will be its real test
5	i should have ordered two !
3	do n't know how much
4	there are many things to like about this serum the lightness of the feel on the skin , the absorbency , the light aroma of orange , the vitamins a , c and e and the inclusion of a collagen boost i have n't been using it long enough to expect visual results and do n't know if i will see any on my 80 year old skin several things are bothersome it has a very high price compared to what appear to be so many other competitive products that promise the same results with many of the same ingredients the lack of packaging and instructions also makes one wonder at the price , one would expect to receive it boxed with and instructions instead , it arrives just as is , with directions that require a magnifying glass on the back there must be a here that we 're not to since i like the ingredients , as far as i know them , and it does seem to make my skin softer , and i like the aroma and it all agrees with my sensitive skin , i 'll continue to use it if it turns out to be a miracle for 80 year old skin , i 'll amend my review right away !
5	i have very fine hair and it 's hard to find an oil that does n't weigh it down but this works i 've tried it in wet hair and dry hair and it makes my hair soft and tames the fly away hairs around my face where i use the curling iron the most i use a nickle sized amount in my palm and i have medium length hair it has a very light pleasant fragrance which i love i was using oil from walmart which is a spray on but i stopped using that because i did n't see any difference in my hair the healing oil makes my hair so soft oddly , my hair needs to be washed less when i use this
5	love the color !
5	have used before and was glad to find this via amazon gentle and never irritating softens cleanses completely pleasant muted fragrance a joy to use and you will probably not find a better cleansing
5	was looking for something that did n't contain petroleum since it does n't actually moisturizer your lips i was using aquaphor as a lip balm but although it makes your lips feel smooth while it 's on , it does nothing to help repair chapped lips once splitting and peeling starts just got this pot in and already love it mine is not hard or grainy it 's smooth and medium soft so it applies easily it is thick but not like a paste it is also clear i think i 've found my new favorite lip product !
5	i love the shellac system as a whole and this polish is no exception depending on the lighting sometimes it looks like a light purple , other times a great taupe color i have fair skin and the color is perfect i 've also just tried layering it over the dark lava and it makes a great dark grey purple like other reviewers said , you do need two coats of this but i 've found that with most of the shellac color 's
3	i had high hopes for this one the fragrance description promised a light , fruity and floral scent , but i find this has too much artificial \( is it alcohol base \? \) tang to it , and i ca n't detect the fruit , only the strong florals i was hoping for softer notes , but the floral it 's not a terrible scent it 's just not what i was expecting this is for flower fans
3	one would think that with a name like ultra rich , it would be thick however , this is not the case with this lotion it 's very thin and watery while it does do a good job absorbing into the skin , it 's very expensive and i cannot say that it is any better than aveeno i do use the l'occitane shea butter hand cream and it is a great product for body lotion , you can stick to a regular pharmacy brand
5	this cream leaves the skin soft and helps with rosacea break outs
4	i really like this product but have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the price point and the fact that it is n't as effective as a retin a product with that being said , if you 're like me and have very sensitive skin retin a can be very irritating whereas , because this product is n't as strong , it is less likely to irritate skin and i did n't have a problem with it irritating mine you can actually feel it working , and people who have used retinol products in the past will be familiar with the feeling so you know it 's doing its job with that being said , do n't expect miracles it does fight fine likes and wrinkles and gives skin a more youthful appearance but you have to keep using it it 's not a face lift in a bottle if you 're realistic with your expectations and prefer a retinol product to retin a you 'll like this product
4	i really like the dermablend brand this is my fourth product that i have ordered and i have been pleased with each one the concealer covers skin blemishes and smooths uneven skin tones it is also good for under the eye circles
5	i love this palette perfect for travel
5	great mascara ! i 've been using this for about a month now and it 's great it goes on nicely and spreads out my lashes so they do n't clump it makes you have full , long eyelashes it lasts all day and through the night without flaking i just use some makeup remover and it comes off easily normally i do n't like wearing waterproof mascara cause it clumps and is hard to get off but with this i do n't have that problems
5	nice blow dryer but a little heavy !
5	excelente
4	i love this colour ! it 's so pretty ! took a star off though because it 's significantly more pink than peach so the product picture is kind of misleading
4	this does a nice job minimizing lines and wrinkles it goes on smoothly it dispenses a bit too much in one pump because it is thin so be careful to dispense where it wo n't drip right off your fingers i gave it 4 stars because it is a bit too oily label states to apply moisturizer right after but you really need to give the serum some time to be absorbed this is not always convenient for me in the morning \( not so big a problem at night \)
5	slicked back hair is in fashion once again this gel hair pomade has a sweet citrusy fragrance reminiscent of barbershop aftershave balm it is easy to comb through the hair , produces a high sheen , and does a good job holding the hair in place the plastic jar holds 2 75 oz ingredients water \( aqua \) , peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil , steareth 20 , polyester 5 , propanediol , c12 15 alkyl benzoate , glycerin , phenyl trimethicone , hydrogenated ethylhexyl olivate , ppg 5 20 , jojoba esters , peg 12 dimethicone , citrus \( grapefruit \) peel oil , lavandula angustifolia \( lavender \) oil , \( kelp \) extract , \( basil \) leaf extract , seed oil , moringa seed oil , kernel oil , seed oil , camellia sinensis leaf extract , \( tea tree \) leaf oil , \( sage \) leaf oil , panthenol , hydrogenated olive oil unsaponifiables , ethylhexylglycerin , chloride , phenoxyethanol , chlorphenesin , benzoic acid , acid , , tetrasodium edta , bht , benzyl alcohol , limonene , linalool certified organic
4	love this color ! it 's so pretty and coraly goes with every skin tone
5	love this product i just got it in and used it right away my nails look clean , solid , and flawless i also purchased the lavender , and did one layer with the pink in this set i also like that this set includes a booklet of how to layer the tints and what color you will get in addition , this is a fast drying manicure , which is really great i did it before i left for work , grabbed by bag and left by the time i got to work \( 20 minutes \) , it was fully dry no smudging , etc
5	as a lip conditioner , this product is amazing just one day of use and my lips were as soft and supple as baby skin it looks and has the consistency of lip gloss \( not quite clear , but with a slight opaqueness \) but not as sticky as for helping to increase the fullness of the lips as the box claims i did not notice any effect in that way , other than the illusion of a slightly thicker lip that would happen if you put any kind of lip gloss on according to the directions , one is supposed to apply this 3 times a day for 29 days to get the maximum effect ingredients , octyldodecyl stearoyl stearate , simmondsia chinensis \( jojoba \) seed oil , beeswax cera alba cire dabeille , butyrospermum parkii \( shea \) butter , communis \( castor \) seed oil , ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate , ethylhexyl , tocopheryl acetate , palmitoyl , hydrogenated soybean oil , , , sorbitan isostearate , , , flavor \( aroma \) may contain \( \) mica , titanium dioxide \( ci 77891 \) , iron oxides \( ci 77491 , ci 77499 , ci 77499 \) , red 7 lake \( ci \) , red 30 lake \( ci \) , red 6 \( ci \) , yellow 5 lake \( ci 19140 \)
3	pretty color , needs too many coats , chips easily
5	i am so impressed with this eye cream ! it has a great feel and the effects last all day even when i wash my face at night my eyelids still feel as though i 've just put this cream on soft and supple the thing i like best though \( because i'm kind of cheap er , frugal \) is that it takes only the tiniest drop of this cream to treat both eyes i got a sample to try , but i am definitely buying more of this when the sample is finished \( though it seems like it 's going to last a long time ! \)
5	very happy with all of my billy jealousy skincare products this is another daily use product that never leaves my skin oily or greasy it 's perfect for my combination skin
5	love it !
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
1	of note i do not have sensitive skin and ive never had a problem with or acne creams in the past one application of a small amount of this on my forehead an almost immediate burning sensation that intensified rapidly wiping it off revealed reddened skin this might be a fluke , but i wo n't be using it again
5	this stuff is amazing ! heres a photo of the progress i love it i keep it in the fridge and use it at night i will never go without it !
5	who would have thought that something so nearly black could be so useful \? i have this color and dark pool which is totally black and another must own what 's great about uber dark colors is that you can layer on top of them for a totally different look the first week i started off with this as a regular manicure it 's so very dark to the point of looking black two coats is all you need btw then i layered two coats of a regular nail polish top coat of that i found off of ebay wow let it dry \( i mean let it dry for hours ! ! ! \) then put cnd 's uv top coat on and marched forward another few days with another new look which was more gray silver then i put overly onyx on the tips and added black glitter for another new look it will stay this way for a few more days until i soak the whole thing off what fun !
5	such a bright cheery coral color ! i bought a few extras for my bridesmaids love the shimmer to it , actually matches the color in the bottle really well i 've had others in this shade \( in the bottle \) that look fire engine red on the nails this does n't do that love it on my toes !
5	i love trying new bath and body products especially ones like this this rituals the ritual of ayurveda foaming shower gel , first of all it should have a cap on it mine did n't the product is supposed to come out as a gel , and once added to water turn into a foam mine actually came out as a foam , and it foams and foams ! this is supposed to smell like indian rose , whatever that is it is not related to the rose flower , and sweet almond oil i did n't think it smells like that either i am trying to think of what it does smell like for some reason i want to say sandalwood or musk , maybe a little beachy in any case to me it has a nice , warm , pleasant scent the scent , you can definitely smell it on your skin , but it 's not overpowering , but i found myself wanting to smell it , so that 's good i 'd love to try more of this companies products this scent would make a nice hand soap or bar soap , candles , etc the red of the canister is different too
2	scent is a very personal preference i found this eau de toilette overly sweet and flowery not too distinct from the other perfumes i only had 1 spritz in the air and my husband and boys all complained about the old lady scent if possible , try on some before buying
5	on time shipping and , brand new ! !
5	i love this night cream it goes on smoothly and have given me nice results it 's thick and fairly clear , without too strong of a scent i have sensitive skin and had no issues with this cream , other then liking it i 've used some other vichy products in the past and have had good results with the brand nice night cream and recommended
5	i love cnd shellac and bought this color to wear during the perfect for showing my team spirit !
3	while this nail polish is better than regular polish , i just do n't find it to be amazingly better it may stay on without chips for a day more than regular polish , but not much more than that since it does n't cost a lot more than some of the high end regular polishes , it 's probably worth it \( keep in mind , you do have to have the topcoat for it to be effective \)
5	it 's a flat neon magenta beautiful with a glossy top coat excellent price full size bottle
3	if it was cheaper , i 'd add an additional star to my rating it 's cooling and refreshing the water sprays out from the can in about as fine of a mist as you can get , which is nice but it still seems a bit high priced for what it is it 's very nice moisturizing water , but pretty pricey
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	as a , i use heavy duty body wash from dial and old spice to help get the grime out and smell relatively decent \( that 's what gucci and armani cologne is for \) and never really got into more premium quality soaps or body washes when i had the opportunity to try the baxter lime soap , i thought it was a great chance to see what 's out there and go beyond the industrial cleansers that i 've been using now that the bar is gone from heavy use and i feel satisfied using it , but not to spend the premium pricing on a single bar of soap it 's just not worth my budget the overall effectiveness and lather the baxter soap provides is very nice and i did notice a slight difference in how my skin felt \( smoother \) after a few days of use on top of that , i began to notice a strong lime smell from the bathroom as the bar released a strong , but pleasant , aroma that only lasted about a week it was really nice to have that smell in there , but it did n't last long enough to be a selling point there 's really not much else to say other than it was nice , but when i thought to order more the premium price tag attached made me have second thoughts and order dial body wash instead it 's great if you 're really into body cleansing and have the to back up such a lifestyle but , for the rest of us , i 'll stick with my usual regimen
2	the polish i received looks nothing like the one shown for sale it looks more similar to essie 's play date this was also the first time i 've purchased nail polish online lesson learned stick to purchasing polish in person
5	i have this shade already and i still absolutely love it
1	the first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly wo n't let me return and i'm very disappointed i wo n't be buying polish off amazon again i usually love essie
5	the julep lip gloss in charming is so much prettier than i had expected ! the color as shown on the very fair model looked like a pale yet this is definitely a \( your lips but better \) shade , so hard to find , but a real joy when you do ! there 's a light scent fruit \? vanilla \? chocolate \? that disappears pretty soon , leaving just the smooth and pretty gloss in the tube , it looks light there might be a bit of shimmer , and on the lips , there 's just enough to keep the gloss from looking flat or lifeless there is n't a teen amount of gloss or shimmer or shine i'm getting a bit older , and glosses that used to look great are now in the toss that gloss category , but this gloss is is in my new perfect gloss category sophisticated , luxurious , , virtually unscented , and a gorgeous flattering color it applies with a doe foot applicator that pulls out a single coverage swipe there was no drying or irritation to my mouth , and no glitter friction , and no creep or slide julep , you 're on my for future purchases ! i'm so glad i got to test this beautiful gloss , in a generous sized tube it 's already in my purse for regular use
5	i have been using this brand for a year now and my teeth are whiter it is pricy i prefer the cinnamon flavor i have tried colgate and other name brands but they did n't whiten my teeth , even though they promised to do so
2	this is not really neon you have to put 3 coats since it 's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat
5	thank you so much
4	it is ok
4	this is a very different type of foundation , very thick , it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application this process did take a little getting used to for me , using the right amount and blending it evenly but once i got the hang of it it really did cover well and did n't use additional concealers with it i used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage , you could use your fingers , however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt i used the dermablend powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day
5	love jane iredale lip balm great to apply to your lips , especially with the fall winter seasons coming i highly recommend this product !
5	if you 're familiar with 's book the skin type solution , this is one of the face washes she recommends for oily skin since i also have sensitive skin \( my skin type is \) , i was worried that it would be too drying for me , but i really do like this ! the foaming action is definitely more subtle than other foaming cleansers i 've used , but it suds up nicely and has a light , pleasant scent that is non irritating since it contains salicylic acid , it 's designed for oily and acne prone skin i do n't have acne \( just the occasional pimple \) , but do have that classic oily t zone , and this seems to help reduce the shine what i also like about this is that it is excellent at removing makeup when i wipe a cotton pad with toner over my face after cleansing with this , no makeup residue is left on the cotton pad since i am worried about this being too drying , especially as winter approaches , i will probably save this for nighttime use since it does an excellent job at removing makeup , and use something a bit less drying in the mornings i can also see this tube lasting a really long time since you only need a small amount of product to wash your whole face the price is high , but i will definitely re purchase it when i run out since it works so well
1	my wife does not like this shampoo she said it makes her hair feel dirty
5	all essie nail polish are terrific at least thats what my thirteen year old granddaughter tells me
5	i 've used this product for over 8 years and i 've never loved a cleanser like i do nia 24 i'm 57 , and i live in santa , new mexico the sun shines more than 300 days a year here and the is over 7 , 000 feet , so skin can and die a quick death ! but , sun damage i had started having \( brown areas at my hairline \) in my 40 's have actually disappeared and , there is no bleaching element in this stuff it just works all these product work do yourself a favor and also buy the scrub \( the only scrub my dermatologist has ever recommended \) , and the repair cream i wish this had been around when i was younger
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i have combination skin , plus i have a stressful job and life i also have very sensitive skin so finding something that works that did n't dry my skin out or give me a rash or burn my skin has been something of a wild chance i was actually gifted a small version of this in their detox kit and fell in love not only did it work , but it did n't smell , was easy to use , and i could literally see the difference in a matter of days not weeks i know that more than likely wo n't be typical for most people , but i know i 'll continue to buy this as long as it works
5	i first balked at the cost of this product but was fortunate to be able to try it normally we never spend this amount on what i known as lip gloss we were pleasantly surprised the lacquer itself is much thicker and deeply colored than anything we have tried before the viscosity allows for precise application and the brush is likely the best i have ever used the product provides a matte finish as opposed to shiny gloss and does not harden when dried somehow , it seems to remain moist while not coming off easily there is very associated with the product best described as slightly sweet in our use \( 3 girls tested the product \) , we all agreed the stayed applied for hours and did not lose intensity of color note on color swatches in product information as a , it is important for me to point out that it is very difficult to match exact shades of the product you are looking for through a computer monitor the vast majority of computer do not display colors accurately , different shades of the same color unless your monitor is capable and color even then , unless the manufacturer created a white balanced and color balanced image and it perfectly , there will still be a in short , you may want to visit a local store that has the color swatches
5	i cannot even begin to tell you what this product has done for me ! i use this right after i shower , it soaks in very quickly and leaves my skin matte soft i use it as a primer for my make up and it does exactly that my make up goes right on top , and it stays matte for most of the day it also has been great for my skin , which is really sensitive to any low quality skin products
5	i love this lotion it keeps my skin moisturized without clogging my pores or feeling oily i'm very happy i just wish it came in a larger size
5	the top coat goes on smoothly with a brush i like to use a light coat over makeup , it adds some sparkle , but i can control it to tone it up or down the sparkles are very tiny please note that it adds some whitish tint to makeup , so you might need to adjust your other makeup when you use the sparkles
5	the best fall brownish red reddish brown out there buy
5	the best light moisturizer !
5	very bright and super fun for summer
5	so i have used this product for years and swear by it i started losing my hair at a very young age by the time i was in my 50 's i really needed to do something thank god this product was introduced to me , it really has changed my life i can now get dressed and go out with confidence because all i need to is spray my hair with hair spray and then add this product to the spots that are balding it makes a huge and i recommend it to anyone who has hair loss i it every day and no one knows i use anything ! i have seen one negative review but i do n't think she was using it correctly , otherwise she would not have had those issues also you must use the color that 's closest to your hair color and you will have wonderful results ! !
5	excellent
5	amazing i love it
5	this truly is an amazing product for the price ! it makes your scalp feel amazing and you honestly do feel and see a difference in your hairline
4	i shall start out by saying this is a pricey little bottle of serum probably more than most people would pay i now would be of those most people i have paid 300 for a somewhat larger bottle of a serum from neiman and loved the products at that time in my life i would also hazard a guess that those products i used in my 60s are probably what gives me fewer wrinkles in my 80s but , now that i can no longer afford those kind of products , i look for one cheaper i also feel like another reviewer that stated would only put the best ingredients in a product with her name on it i this cause i could n't remember it exactly and there is no serum to help so , we got past the cost which was the only negative i saw and maybe it 's not a real negative as a little of this goes a long way maybe it will last a long time if there was a scent there , i did not detect it i tried it on the back of my hand , and sniff as i could , i could not smell a smell on my hand it soaked in immediately my hand is not particularly wrinkly so i ca n't say much about how the liquid works on hand wrinkles on my face , it soaked up immediately and my skin certainly did feel soft not greasy or sticky like some serums , but really nice to the touch over time , i shall know a little more on what it does to my skin if you do n't see an to this after a month or so , then i have no complaints or can add much to what i 've said i think it 's a good product \( i 've tried others in that brand \) as was all the others i 've tried but , i feel relatively sure you can find one cheaper if you look around should n't be hard however , if you like using one brand and you 've tried her other products , give this one a chance to be your skin changer \( notice i did n't say \) dna plays a role in those things i hated the fact i could n't read the ingredients well , could n't read anything really yeah , yeah , i know , old people 's eyes are not great but with a that made my cat look like , i should 've been able to read it a on the person who had this bright idea for a container
1	im sorry , but i am just not buying the whole from the french volcanoes thing i like a few of the vichy products , but vichy mineralizing thermal water soothing for face , from the french volcanoes , 1 69 fl oz is not one of them though a very cute little container , i find is not so pleasant to spray liquid on my face for me , it feels no different then splashing water on my face product description vichy mineralizing thermal water enriched with 15 rare minerals 15 clinical studies have proven the skin health benefits of vichy mineralizing thermal water recognized by the french of medicine for its soothing and properties every skin care regimen and infused in all vichy skin care products 100 pure and natural preservative free paraben free fragrance free alcohol free non comedogenic allergy tested based on a clinical study of 24 women in 4 days activity , an anti free radical enzyme responsible for skin 's defenses , is increased by 20 , in 7 days redness is eliminated and skin dryness score is reduced by , after 1 month significant reduction of the signs of irritation stinging , itching and burning ingredients aqua water brand story founded in france in , vichys formulas combine clinically proven ingredients with mineral rich volcanic water to deliver real results to women of all ages today , vichy is the 1 anti aging brand in european pharmacies
5	lovely floral scent not too overpowering yet noticeable lasts longer than most perfumes never used this fragrance before normally use chanel fragrances \( no 5 and \) and was a good choice for me since i do not like too overpowering and sweet floral scents i prefer floral citrus feminine scents i am enjoying the perfume
5	had this polish put on my nails for the first time today and i love the color ! ! i have never gone beyond pinks and reds so this is really different for me the color is a beautiful powder blue and is not chalky looking at all
5	love the peppermint there is a small sensation that you would expect from mint but you get clean , well conditioned hair
4	this color was everything that i wanted it to be almost exactly what you see on the picture ! i did my nails , then went to work two days later , so unfortunately it did chip that was my fault though i was a bit rough on them ! regardless , i would definitely recommend this essie polish it is beautiful !
5	this is a great light almost nude color i received this polish very quickly great fall color love essie polish
5	if you like sandalwood and woodsy scents , this is your fragrance it is my all time favorite worth its price
5	seems to work very well no clumping on my eyelashes
5	great for tired eyes it made my eyes feel better that 's for sure , hopefully with continued use these will make my eyes look better too i have just started having fine lines under my eyes , as i'm nearing 40 and i try to take care of my skin as well as i can these are a bit of a pain to use , but they are worth it organic , and it seems to work well
5	is a lovely bronze with little flecks \( minuscule flecks \) of glitter , subtle but very pretty the way it in the light i would say it is flattering to most skin tones and it goes on well wears well unlike the butter london metallic polish i tried that did n't have any glitter it was beyond awful streaked , looked horrid on and chipped quickly i also have all hail the queen a metallic with the shimmer and it goes on brilliantly and wears well my lesson in butter metallics is to only go for those with shimmer
3	i have n't used this long enough to know whether it works or not but i have used better products i will continue it since i already bought it but the proactiv pimple spot remover works better i dislike proactiv , it 's not good for your face really but the spot remover is better than this one , however , i feel more safe using this would n't repurchase i do n't get many pimples but only 1 or 2 during my cycle
4	good product lathers up quickly
5	i bought this for my sister who loves nail polish it arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color she gets compliments on it all the time , and like other essie polishes , it does n't chip easily
5	i got this for my wife , who declared it perfectly fine for a gel eyeliner pencil it went on smooth , and lasted the entire day when she used it nice color and thickness no irritation or smudging , and no complaints at all !
5	i am a beauty product addict price doesnt matter to me , ill try anything , and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion my fave hair serum is 5 my fave face cream is 200 i mention this only because i want to be clear that i am not attracted to only higher end lines that said , i tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer but as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning , and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays \( if im lucky \) , i always struggle with this i also do n't want to use a flat iron every day , because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color i stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner searching for products with a more natural lean , although i know some people have issues with some ingredients here my hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this , and a little bit of my fave hair serum , and its almost perfect \( its only ever perfect when i flat iron ! \) soemtimes i do n't even use the serum , and its still great the conditioner also has really helped with damaged ends
4	this is n't really a mask , it is a serum you do n't apply it like a traditional mask it soaks in , because it is a gel the scent is really nice , and it makes my skin soft i find it best to use it at night , that way you can let it soak in while you sleep
3	just within a week two coat application , and already it is chipping will keep only because of the neutral shade !
4	my hair used to be thick and wavy as i 've aged , it 's thinner and finer , so much so that a or hair clip slips out i tried so many products i ca n't even list them all serums , mousses , beach sprays , etc i did have some success with philip b 's maui spray , but then i tried this it 's amazing it 's not like you suddenly have big hair , it just feels like the strands have a thickness to them but not weighed down at all i use it on towel dried hair before i style or air dry a little goes a long way so this will last for some time it especially helps at the top of my scalp where i was seeing a lot of scalp and not enough hair i'm not saying it grows hair , but just seems to fill in more big like !
5	l'occitane has long been offering this version of shea butter the company had it way before shea butter was accepted by mainstream companies , who then added to their health and beauty lines , either as a stand alone ingredient or combined with other ingredients to make it fragrant or to make it cheaper however , if you want the best , the most moisturizing , the longest lasting skin \( and even hair ! \) moisturizer , use this one shea butter comes from the nuts of the african tree it is a wonderful of vitamin a l'occitaine 's pure shea butter is both organic and fair trade approved you can layer this product with l'occitaine 's lighter versions \( their hand and foot creams which contain less shea , for example \) but if you want the heavy , get this the one , the only , the original , by l'occitaine this product is great for dry cracked hands , feet , elbows , lips and , yes , dry hair ! i love it for my very high maintenance skin , and have given as a gift as well it is worth the price
5	i ca n't say enough good things about cnd ! use the right alcohol and follow the directions , you wo n't be disappointed !
5	beautiful true one coater polish ! i purchased this after a review on jessface90 's youtube channel and i love it it 's really nice to use when working with nail vinyls as it is a true one coater
5	i am a licensed nail and a huge fan of cnd products ! i love the shimmery color of safety pin !
5	all of jane iredale is the best
2	i wanted to love this the description sounded just like something id like and i hoped that the toilette parfum would be light enough to wear to work and not offend anyone plus i have used other products from crabtree and evelyn and been pleased alas , it was not to be i have a sensitive nose , overly sensitive probably but this was all kinds of no no with a capital the was to lavender as banana are to bananas i adore a good fresh lavender but this was not a clear astringent lavender , it was a chemical of lavender it has a heavy alcohol top note , which is to be expected with a toilette water but it hung on much longer than i wanted , but the powdery middle note was just odd and it lasted much too long in that middle range of too strong to be two hours old then the bottom note is too much drawer for me , though it was more in the muted range i expected my advice if you want to try it because you like that old fashioned type of scent is to apply it properly spray into the air and walk through it , never apply directly to the skin or try using it as a light room spray or closet spray i do n't want to here but gone are the days of women wearing heavy scents into work and getting away with it so many of us are into more air and we all need to be sensitive to the noses of our coworkers no one wants to be remembered as that strongly stinky person in the office your scent should be special to you and to anyone who is close enough to share it in your personal space
4	this stuff works pretty well , although i would have liked a little more hold over a longer duration still , for performance , it did nicely enough , and it some of the current items i have tried out it also does not take a lot to work the sizing that is normally presented is about the size of a dime , and i found that this works with this stuff that is good compared to a lot of products , where you sometimes feel like you would have to bathe in it to get it to hold it also does not have that weird , sticky feel to it , and the stuff smells fine
5	so happy i purchased this ! smells so good ! its the real thing
5	i have pretty sensitive skin , and i hate the feel of creams , this is a gel , you only need a little so it lasts a very long time , it is cool to the touch , and the part i love the best , it lasts all day , it completely eliminates shave irritation , feels cool , and works ! ! and my girl loves the smell , which is very mild , i do not even notice any scent
5	this is a great summer polish for toes and fingers , but i mostly wear it on my toes it 's a great shade of pink that does n't clash with anything else you might be wearing and essie pretty much wo n't chip \( at least on your toes \) for at least a week great great color !
5	this is a high quality product that gives you a nice tan without the drawbacks of possibly getting skin cancer through lengthy sun exposure as i get older , i'm avoiding the sun a lot more , so this is a great alternative it goes on smoothly , has no annoying chemical smell and dries fairly quickly i'm not sure why it 's called a mousse as i associate that with hair products , but it does come out as a foam my only quibble is the price it 's quite pricey for the amount you get , but the amazon price is still less expensive than sephora i would stock up on this when it 's prime day or on sale
3	this does a decent job of moisturizing my lips and the faint mojito taste is very pleasant , but it just sits on my lips instead of absorbing into them this is more like a lipgloss and it 's just too shiny for my husband to use that being said , we prefer burt 's bees or jack black lip balms because they do a much better job of conditioning our lips and keeping them healthy and soft
3	clean cool cotton is a little strong for me i prefer clean warm cotton , even though warm cotton smells like fabric softener clean says cool cotton captures the optimistic feeling of a sunny day , but that does n't come through for me top notes italian bergamot , crisp green apple , lemon zest heart notes blossom , cooling mint , fresh cotton accord base notes creamy musks , peach skin , amber droplet i do n't smell any of the fruit scents at all , which i love in a perfume i'm getting more of a woody musky scent the scent is moderately strong and lingering clean cool cotton is a nice scent , but not one of my favorites
5	the color is nice and stays on a long time unlike other polishes i have tried would definitely buy this again
5	love the shade it glides on and has major staying power maybe not the equivalent of a gel but i had no chips after 8 days and that 's a record for me
4	i first discovered a powder foundation many years ago made by shiseido and loved being able to apply it either wet or dry this product by bliss is pretty good and because the shades are not really in words , i 'd suggest finding the most suitable for your skin tone in a store before ordering online the natural shade is just as i 've discovered most bliss cosmetics , rather yellow in undertone , which i learned years ago is the most common for a majority of caucasian skin tones this particular formula is non irritating and not offensive with added scents like the other bliss cosmetics , this has a plastic case that is what i would call no frills so you are not paying for a high class cosmetic product for dry skin , i prefer liquid foundations but i do like the portability of this for travel as well as on the go touch ups
5	this is the first tanning product i have used in a long time , and i am very pleased with the results it is easy to apply , and left my skin with a nice , even tan adding a little color to my skin in the winter helps me not look so sickly pale this is definitely a great product , and it has a very mild scent
5	love them own two plan on getting all blends into shadow perfectly i use them all the time cute packaging also
5	i absolutely love this product ! every time i use it i wake up and my complexion is clear my skin tone is even and bright this product is a must buy ! i use it two nights a week to help clear out dead skin , etc i highly recommend if you 're looking for a serum like product to add to your weekly skin care routine
5	i love this serum and i already use a number of excellent serums the serum is thicker than most , which allows the ginseng , ceramides and ginkgo to penetrate on hot nights i even use it by itself as a moisturizer my only problem is with the artificial color i was hoping the color was from from chamomile but alas it is artificial , ci 42090 \( blue 1 \) the ingredients are aqua \( water , eau \) , glycerin , propylene glycol , dimethicone , carbomer , gingko biloba leaf extract , panax ginseng root extract , triethanolamine , dimethiconol , caprylyl glycol , cyclopentasiloxane , ethylhexyl , hexylene glycol , sodium chloride , phenyl trimethicone , , lecithin , phenoxyethanol , ci 42090 \( blue 1 \) , ci 19140 \( yellow 5 \) this means that it might be for women with sensitive skin i already see ingredients that my daughter in law must avoid the gel is basically all artificial when aloe or seaweed extracts could have done the job i probably should knock it down a star but it works for me i have no problem with the fragrance it is pleasant and unobtrusive
1	so i feel like this does absolutely nothing for my skin i might as well be applying water
5	i am always skeptical to use miraculous products but this really works \) i started with the liquid to grow my lashes now i am using mascara from the same line and my lashes look like to die for \)
5	i honestly did not expect the polish to be so sheer \( 4 coats required to be opaque yet still not bright \) i recommend painting your nails white then putting about 2 coats of this polish on thanks so much !
3	a summer favorite , fuschia with a hint of shimmer i love this color , but this bottle is thin normally i would need two coats to cover , but i need 3 from this bottle
5	as exppected
5	with the receipt of this brush i am adding a lovely powder brush to my it is by far the nicest brush in my collection it is so soft there was no indication in the packaging but i suspect that it is made of fur of some kind the application of powder or blush with this brush is wonderful all product is smoothly applied and evenly applied i am very pleased with the outcome of the application the handle is wrapped in wicker or straw of some kind this one will last a long , long time
4	product works well but is a little sticky and you really have to rub it in a little goes a long way
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
1	my husband has been using toppik for awhile now it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head , which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair and in the sun , it actually turns a pinkish red \( he uses dark brown \) ! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie even with a bit of wind or humidity , the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face , making it look like tar it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still do n't know that he uses the product ! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind , constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product , and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it does n't even bother me , my husband constantly obsesses over his hair instead of enhancing his look , toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place instead of boosting his confidence , toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair
4	i am not a fan of facial hair , in part because it feels and looks so wiry so i was very excited to get this product for my husband to try i immediately noticed a softer feel and shinier , smoother appearance i deducted a star because my husband is not a huge fan of the scent it would be ideal if this was odorless if the guy wants a scent he can use cologne this product does n't need to try to do both in sum , i highly recommend this product if you are tired of the wiry look and feel of a beard ! !
5	tropix is definitely a hot bright color the color has more orange in it than i wanted i thought of this color as cajun shrimp since i am a pink color person , i ca n't say it 's one of my favorites but i still like it
3	obliphica seaberry shine mist gives hair a nice light shine i have previously tried oil based products that you rub into your hair those have weighed down my hair this is a light spray mist that does n't i have thin hair , so i use most products very sparingly it is made to be a uv protectant that helps your hair color last longer i had colored my hair for twenty years and had decided the other year to give my hair a break from coloring so i ca n't speak to the spray helping color last longer i do like that it is a uv protectant it is also alcohol free , which i like the scent is strong i like it , it reminds me of a floral beachy scent scent is personal and this scent may not be for everyone
5	best price around , beats the mall
4	my favorite thing about these is the subtlety and the fact that they blend well that way , it 's not obvious that you had a dramatic change and you can add to it day by day if you so choose only caveat i 've noticed is that i do n't think it lasts that long it 's advertised for a week and i think it 's more like 3 4 days that 's fine for me , since i usually do it for a specific event or weekend , but just so you know
5	i realize these are men 's products but i am a woman i have waist length very fine hair that is completely flat a stylist told me to use men 's hair pomades near the crown it works very well at giving my hair some i also have an annoying cowlick that this product can i 've tried this brand 's pomade and that works great i was looking for a slightly firmer hold this clay product works better for me than anything i have tried a finger full , warmed up in my hands and through my crown , gives my hair lift all day i do n't characterize the scent as tobacco but rather \( to my nose \) a very grounded vetiver , ylang ylang type fragrance i like it a lot and find it very distinctive and warm if you need control , i 've not tried anything better than this clay treatment
5	i am 74 years old any product that makes my skin smoother is a winner for me
4	the first thing i noticed about this product was the price i thought it was too high until i got the product in the mail it was in a high class box with a big container of makeup plus you get a separate compact to boot my wife loved it she was impressed with the many variety of colors and different applications she sat down with my daughter and applied makeup to her \( to her great delight \) and had a ball although a few of the colors broke up a little bit but most of them there were no problems great gift idea !
1	this might work well for others , but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated also , the color has a greenish tinge , which was not the look i was going for and have worked better for me
2	hello everyone and hope everyone is okay i tried leave in conditioner , and the botanical boost , and the climate control the only one that did a little bit for my hair was the leave in conditioner it took out most of the tangles , but it weighed it down alot i have oily , down past my shoulder length hair and i was not happy with the products at all first , the climate control was supposed to do just that , but instead of making it bouncy it came out extremely dry , and frizzy ! the botanical boost just made it limp and flat and not at all shiny now , maybe someone with hair that is not oily and more curly than mine would be happy with this product , but i was not i'm going to give them away to may want them and like them , but i would not purchase again
5	i get post partem hair loss when my babies are 3 4 months old this time was worse than last time and i had actual bald spots along with thinning right at the front of my hairline ! this stuff is great you could n't see the bald spots and it seemed to thicken the new baby hairs growing back in i bought the applicator and it worked great i am now at 7 months post partem and i do n't need to use it as much , but i still have about half the container left i will save it for my next baby the only thing i will mention is that these fibers do cling so , make sure to shake your head a bit , maybe finish getting ready and then wipe off your face and clothes if you have to also , i have very dark hair and used the dark brown color , so i ca n't rate the other colors
4	dermablend smooth liquid concealer makeup for medium to full coverage with matte finish , 5 shades , 0 2 fl oz the maker states that this dermatologist created lightweight , smoothing liquid concealer will provide seamless , even coverage for facial skin that it is an all purpose smoothing liquid concealer which will provide medium coverage will glide on smoothly to conceal dark circles , under eye circles , cover acne scars , blemishes , signs of fatigue , dark spots , blur the appearance of redness and rosacea the formula which features high performance pigments , dermablend states , will not turn cakey or masky offers all day hydration , leaves skin comfortable , looking naturally flawless offers up to 16 hours of consistent smudge and transfer resistant color wear when set with powder dermatologist tested , ophthalmologist tested for under eye use , allergy tested non comedogenic non acnegenic fragrance free , sensitive skin tested for use , the maker suggests dot on with concealer wand , tap to blend ingredients liquidum mineral oil , talc , cera alba beeswax , isopropyl palmitate , kaolin , stearyl stearate , ci magnesium carbonate , carnauba carnauba wax , cera microcrystalline wax , allantoin , lauroyl lysine may contain ci 77891 titanium dioxide , ci 77499 , ci 77492 , ci 77491 iron oxides , ci sulfate i had a similar looking expensive department store product as a concealer and was n't at all happy with it , it did not provide complete coverage so either i had bought a particular tube that was a lemon , or the entire product line was faulty after that , it took me a while to get around to trying this , because i recently had some facial work done and no concealer was going to hide that resulting swelling , discoloration but the work is healing a bit now , looking better , and this concealer worked just fine on any remaining problems no irritation one tip use sparingly a little goes a long way
4	this past week we had extremely cold weather and my hands were very dry put some of this product on my hands and worked it in went on in fairly easily neutral scent at most which is as i prefer could feel something there , but not greasy good result overall have n't used it very often yet , so ca n't say much about long term benefits i'm hopeful seems there would have to be at least some to justify the 20 price for 4 ounces not expensive but more than the usual drug store mass market stuff this product is made for men
5	i did n't think i would like julep nail treatment sheer coat at first , because the fluid seemed to thin the polish just dripped fairly quickly off the brush , and it seemed thinner in consistency than any other polish i have still , when i tried this on , it actually had good coverage , went on smoothly , and added just enough color to make my nails look healthy , covering the slightly stained dull yellow tint i get sometimes from long term polish use it makes my nails look like naked healthy nails that have been buffed and , it feels pretty good on i really like the the way this looks with one coat , and i do n't think i need another the directions say you can wear one or two coats , and then reapply another coat after three to four days they recommend not using this with other polishes if you want to give your nails a break from your gels or acrylics , but do n't want to have ugly looking nails , this is a good product to get update i 've used this for 2 now , and i am surprised and happy to say that my nails do feel stronger , and have grown out without ripping off or chipping as easily as they did before i tried this this treatment really sticks on the nails and does not flake off too easily even if it flakes a bit over time , the color is so neutral , it 's not very noticeable i thought this was a bit pricey when i first used it , but it really does seem worth the money
4	this hand lotion was great , it smelled fabulous and left my hands feeling moisturized during the winter , my hands get terribly dry and cracked and this lotion seemed to do a good job bringing them back to normal
5	great color and product essie is a great nail polish ! this color was difficult to find at my local stores so glad i found it on amazon
5	this is one of the nicest scents i have run across in quite some time it reminds me of estee 's beautiful , but it 's not as strong and smells better the bottle is a generous size , plus you get two purse keep one and give one to your mom or daughter i believe this fragrance is good for all ages it also comes in a beautiful gift box
4	while i have been a fan of other juice beauty products , this one will not be my favorite it smelled a little off coming out of the bottle it is organic and filled with juices , oils , etc , so perhaps something turned rancid or the combination is not pleasing to me it also felt tacky on my skin this effect did not go away , so my skin did n't feel smooth and moisturized that being said , the jury is still out on whether it firms smoothes fine lines around my eyes considering how much i liked the other jb products , i will give them the benefit of the doubt and will , of course , update if something changes
5	i do my own nails at home and love cnd shellac it is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days my nails always look amazing and i get a ton of compliments i also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome
4	i do like this product and it goes on easily , but be careful to putting too much on at once at least for me , it did n't blend well , but i 've got terribly dry skin at times and i need some moisture down on the skin before attempting to apply any makeup at all that said , this applies beautifully to say my hand or lower arm that is n't quite as dry
4	i like this essie color this was my favorite color for a long time ! i used the whole bottle !
4	not as creamy as i remember from past use but good coverage
5	this product arrived quickly and was exactly what i had hoped for ! the color is gorgeous , the formula is great , and the polish truly holds up to essie 's name a beautiful cool toned grey lacquer that works for all seasons and occasions
5	this shower gel really foams up so you only need to use a small amount and i have found that all of the scents offered smell really good i can be prone to sensitivity from some soaps and have n't had any issues with this brand type
5	as described !
4	look at the picture these glosses are so cute it 's sick ! i bought the orange flavor which came with a grumpy face perfect for me tastes delicious and citrusy , which is a major plus color is a little brighter on my lips than what i was expecting though , so i always need to apply it when checking with a mirror to make sure i do n't look like a clown afterwards still , this is a super cute purchase that i do n't regret !
5	excellent product , it takes just a small amount to cover my thinning area
5	good product for making skinny hair fat !
5	beautiful color as a stand alone or on top of other polish to add some sparkle
5	this is a lightweight lotion that goes on smooth and leaves a delicate scent , a hint of honey it feels very nice on my skin , i used it on legs and arms and it was n't heavy or sticky and the scent did not linger all day , which is fine with me ! i had not heard of this brand before but will be looking for it next time i'm shopping for lotion
3	i 've been using this for about two weeks , and for me there is no impact i 'll keep going until the bottles are empty and update the review if something changes , but so far , i'm underwhelmed they smells nice , and they 're easy to use , but they under perform compared to some other products i 've tried , such as olay 's regenerist
2	this 18 21 man made \( \? \) hair styling paste is functional and pleasant as a pomade or hair product , but so intensely scented with a rather unpleasant patchouli tobacco accord that i ca n't use it regularly it 's a thick , very dry feeling lanolin and clay based paste , with a lot of titanium white visible when you spread it into hands and hair in heavy application this might be a problem , visually , but it smells so strongly i could n't tolerate a heavy application anyhow it applies nicely once softened needing significant body heat to do so and works okay , if not at all high hold , as a hair styling addition but the scent is like bathing your head in i felt i had a cloud of aggressive cheap cologne following me around for the whole day ca n't recommend it for anyone but the axe teenager crowd , due to the way too strong scent
4	and there is no ingredient listing that i can see also there was a little wiping off the print on the bottle still it is a lovely shampoo and smells kind of like caramel i think it is gentle i have been looking for higher quality shampoos and i think this one is pretty good so far
5	i was n't sure about this color but the minute i tried it on i was in love ! the color has a bit of shimmer and its more of a pinkish coral color
4	i have such a hard time with foundation or cc cream in that so many leave my face greasy after a few hours or they are either way too dark or too light this is just perfect for me my skin is n't greasy even after 5 hours and this matches skin tone in a lot of different tones plus the bonus of having a sunscreen in it i ordered the light medium
5	i like this more than the regular product
5	essie is a great polish brand i 've never had problems with the length of time it lasts it does n't chip easily either this is a perfect color for winter , spring , or summer its simple and clean and looks great with a coat of glitter on top i love it
5	i love love love this wand ! i have used curing irons and have never been able to keep my curls for the whole day or get nearly as much volume as i have with his wand ! i love that this wand it has temperature control so you can choose the heat setting you want my hair never smells burnt after i use it either it gives my hair so much body and volume and the waves stay all day ! it leaves my hair feeling so soft and looks so healthy and shiny ! this wand did come with a glove but i do n't use it the wand does get very hot but i love the fact that it has a hot free tip so you can rest your finger on the end and its not hot ! seriously the no heat tip is what sold me i will never go back to a curling iron at first it was a little tricky to use but i watched some youtube videos to help me see how to use it properly ! trust me use this and you will not regret it ! the price was great and i like it better than any other brand the chi runs about 65 bucks and my has both this and the chi and i tried them both and loved the hot tools ! great investment !
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	i love this shade cannot be without it
4	i loooove the color of this nail polish it matchs exactly what i wanted it to match the only downside is that it chips fairly easily without topcoat , so that is necessary
5	bought as a gift for my wife , she loves it
5	this is the best sun screen that i have ever used
3	the description of elemis pro collagen serum really drew me in and i hoped that this product would be different from others i have tried there 's nothing like promising a 40 something year old woman her fine lines will be reduced , but sadly i have not seen any change in my skin over the past month of using this product elemis serum has a rather strong , lingering , perfume scent it is n't a bad scent , it is just stronger and more noticeable than i am used to with face products the serum is quite thick and oily feeling applying it feels like rubbing coconut oil on my skin i have been using this at night , after washing my face , and then following it with my usual moisturizer as the directions indicate as oily as the serum feels , i have to say i do n't wake up in the morning with a greasy face my skin has not broken out or seemed irritated by this product my fine lines and wrinkles have not changed in any way , however so unless i do notice a difference by the time this supply runs out , i will not plan on ordering more
4	love it
3	meh does n't last very long
5	this is my go to color when i'm in a rush to paint my nails very pretty and simple especially if you put a sheer white as your base color
5	this is another gentle , dependable product in the array of mustela products we consistently use in our home we used them on our toddler grandson right off the bat , and funny enough i was looking at a baby picture of my nephew from the 90 's and spotted a mustela bottle in the background let 's say it 's a family tradition , lol we like knowing the ingredients are pure and mustela 's performance is tried and true this is the first time i 've tried this product and i was not surprised it lived up to the standard i expected at what point do people say you 're old enough to start using harsh chemicals on your body ! \? i'm baffled by this and have always tried to steer toward natural and or baby products for myself too i like their gentleness and love the way they smell i 've always been a fan of mustela 's signature scent , which is included in most of their products some people find it strong , and in fact i even feel it 's too strong in certain products for babies not the case with this gel \( more like liquid soap \) this is a gentle cleanser , it 's easy on my skin , leaves it soft and carrying a pleasant of fragrance used with an unscented moisturizer , it 's perfect for those who wish for just a hint of scent all in all , i think this fragrance is a love or hate thing if you love the scent you will love this this is a basic , wholesome product which is probably what all of us should be using on our skin i do n't wash my hair with it , but we love the 2 in 1 for our grandson it leaves his curls soft and smelling irresistible
5	i love anything opi and this was definitely up to par ! !
4	it is sometimes difficult to please a teen age daughter clothes as a gift \? ha ! like a dad can choose something she would wear \? shoes the same jewelry believe is or not , sometimes i do ok make up \? never not a chance but who does n't like a challenge i ordered this palette from vine for free of course handed it to her she opened the box and she loved the colors , the case , the size i am a hero ! thanks , vine
5	very nice creamy concealer for fuller coverage i really liked the thick formula on this product , it can be blended out very thinly or it can be built up for fuller coverage i like to dab a bit on my fingers and warm it up and then work it in with a brush i really liked the slightly peach tone , as it will cover up the darker circles better very nice this reminded me a lot of laura mercier 's concealer that i like quite a bit this had very nice and elegant packaging i look forward to trying other products from this line
5	this rich shaving gel provides a luxurious lather that ensures a nice close shave it smells lightly of lemon grass and leaves skin smooth and hydrated it seems to minimize irritation and contains small capsules of vitamin e cruelty free , it is formulated without gluten , sulfates , paraben , mineral oil or petrolatum made in the usa , it makes shaving a pleasure
5	i use this product since 2 years ago and now i can not live without it my hair is too thin and not abundant so when i use it , is like having instant blower
5	love mario badescu ! !
5	muy bueno
1	another reviewed nailed it when she said the color is not what i expected jasmine looks pink online so what a surprise to see a flesh colored balm it is a truly hideous color on me and one that i never would 've ordered if there was even a hint in the description that it would be flesh toned i ca n't see that there 's a way to this color so will just toss it money wasted so disappointed
1	it may be an old essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails
5	ive never before seen much point in buying expensive lipsticks after all , they 're just going to rub off , and i 'll still have to put chapstick on before hand but not with this i did n't realize how moisturizing lipstick on its own could be , and how smoothly it could go on i only need to swipe it over my lips once and its on in full color \( a nice neutral shade \) the color stays for hours as well , which is something i 've never had in a lipstick before ok im convinced , this is superior and i will be
4	update to my previously unhappy review i added another coat and still nothing but 8 hours later i noticed my leg is tanned , so i am happy although it takes awhile , it does work i guess the subtle is a good thing because you can add it in layers and it 's not some shocking coverage all of a sudden i am fair skinned and i applied it to one leg only so that i could compare how dark it was i waited 3 hours per the instructions and nothing happened my leg looks just like the leg that did n't receive any mousse i read the other reviews and i notice a few say they saw subtle changes , well i wanted subtle and saw none needless to say , i'm a bit disappointed
5	i love this dermablend product actually all their products i have tried worked great i just need to find the right one for my skin tone that 's hard though because you see i use this to cover my natural redness i have plenty of color but my face is almost always red so i love this stuff because 1 \) its a sunscreen , 2 \) its in a compact container , 3 \) it last me all day i apply once in the morning to cover my red face , has n't happened yet but eventually someone is gonna see it and ask me why i a man am using make up i will say hey whoa no hold up this my friend is tinted sunscreen fortunately it says it right there on the container so i'm golden \( in more ways than 1 lol \) i get tired of people asking me if i have been on vacation no , i have not been it 's just my face tans very easy and then there is a tint of red although i am not burned this stuff cover s the red , does n't get on my shirt , last all day i love it
5	this serum absorbs quickly and instantly firms skin and improves tone even my pores looked smoother immediately this was a surprise , as most serums i 've used show benefits over time , but do n't have an immediate effect the pump keeps the product clean and dispenses just a bit at a time , and the glass bottle is attractive two pumps was enough for my entire face and neck i'm not sure about all the over the scent to me , it just smells like cocoa butter , so it 's a pleasant beachy scent , but nothing to write home about i 'd just as soon have a neutral scent i do n't smell on my face for 20 minutes after application , but it 's pleasant enough not to be a deal breaker for me the only downside for me is that it 's just not moisturizing enough on its own but even the product labeling says it works best with a moisturizer i do have dry skin , but in the summertime , i do n't usually require additional moisturizer with serums but here , i did i 'd be happier if a serum at this price point did n't need the extra expense of an additional product , but it does such a great job firming , i'm still impressed but the comments about this serum being hydrating were very to me , and if you have dry skin , i would n't count on not needing additional moisturizer
5	i never liked browns , but i love this color ! it 's called take it outside ! great for fall , winter and spring formula is nice , goes on smooth , shiny , and lasts a long time ! the darker color on other fingers is chinchilly by essie which is nice too
5	bought as a gift for my husband after he completely ran out of all cologne \( even the old spice standby ! \) delivery was speedy and the package arrived well packed with the contents protected he \( and i \) love the scent and who does n't feel better when you know you smell gooood !
5	i was looking a finish like this for a long time it 's just what i want ! ! ! little bit pink and transparent
1	made my scalp extremely flakey and gross was also weird clumpy texture
5	i saw this product on the doctors tv show they called it a breakthrough in anti aging technology i absolutely love it and have seen a big difference in my skin it 's worth the money and i will continue to use it !
4	this is the second baxter pomade i have tried \( i have also used the soft water pomade \) both smell pleasant and keep my long , thick curly hair from frizzing this gives a bit more shine than the soft water pomade , but it is a natural looking shine it is not oily or stiff , nor is it a wet look shine it is thick and a little goes a long way my last jar lasted a couple of months i deduct one star for the glass jar , as i use this in the shower and would prefer not to worry about breaking it but no complaints about the product
4	this is a luxurious , elegant bubble bath with a soothing , pleasant aroma it comes in an attractive bottle that sets it apart from the cheaper brands this is an excellent gift item or a way to yourself the bubbles and the scent are long lasting and a little goes a long way the bottom line though is that it is still just bubble bath , so the price seems steep compared to others less costly the fine quality of this bubble bath does n't seem to be that much of a
4	there is clearly more marketing than product going on with this baxter of california night cream it is marketed as a night cream for men , and everything about it is designed to appeal to the masculine , and convince the that putting on a night cream before sleep wo n't un man you the marketing claims that mens skin is different from womens , and this product is specifically formulated for me im not sure that i buy that both my wife and i tried this night cream out , and i cant say that there was any perceivable difference it works aha formula cleans off the dried skin overnight , and is especially welcome during cold and windy winters it is a thick cream , almost like a mask , which is odd if you have n't tried it before it comes out almost like toothpaste , which was a shock at first but it blends into the skin nicely all in all , we are pleased with the results the biggest bonus for this night maybe why it is targeted for that it is entirely odor free i like that i do n't want any scents in my product , especially for a night cream if you are interested in natural products , then baxter of california is not for you the ingredients lists is full of dimethicone and parabens and glycol and that sort of thing
5	as a de shaving fanatic , this is absolutely the top of the line i 've shaved with a half dozen blade razors , i 've used a ton of brushes and soaps , and i 've settled into a routine over the years it was finally time to step up to my forever razor , and this is definitely it note to do n't be scared ! wet shaving is n't that scary you can find a ton of videos online , and a good starter razor \( such as cheaper razors in the merkur line \) can be gotten for a fraction of this price if you 'd prefer to learn before you jump in here pros perfect finish the shiny chrome is just perfect for me , it 's gorgeous and functional grip is fine , after a couple of uses i have n't had any issues whatsoever perfect action i did n't realize the cap of the razor pops off , which is a bit unusual , but i'm sure i 'll get used to it and it looks built to last bottom line , putting a blade on is quick and easy twisting the handle to select your is easy , higher number is harsher perfect shave i started off with a 1 to quickly knock off some hair , and it was easily the most gentle de shave i 've ever had lovely higher settings go as high as i ever want to go , as my favorite feather blades are plenty sharp as always cons high initial investment actually in recent years , the common razors make de look cheaper than ever as of writing , you can get this beautiful razor that will last longer than your lifetime for less than the cost of a few worth of the popular top of the line disposable alternative it 's barely even a choice switch to de , save money weird loading although the action of the cap is smooth , it 's weird to pop off the top my last razor had the butterfly open , which feels much more solid , with much less possibility for injury look up a video before you do this with a real blade reference \( my kit \) i put feather blades in my razor , the of the shaving world my brush is a cheap but effective tweezerman , and my shave soap between soaps and my current stand and bowl are actually from a kit overall , i ca n't recommend this razor highly enough merkur is like the of shaving generally sleek , stylish , technically wonderful my only note would be throw the included blade in the trash , or use it for projects merkur blades are usually garbage i recommend derby hd blades for beginners , and feathers for pros
5	blush has a nice natural color with a subtle shimmer creates natural looking color not obvious one is wearing blush goes on quite sheer flattering on medium skin tone goes on smoothly with a good dry feel easily blends
5	my husband loves this stuff and so do i ! i'm allergic to almost every cologne out there or just do n't like the smell of it this one smells so yummy and it 's not too overpowering to wear to work it 's just a subtle hint of sandalwood love it
4	04 06 2016 another update i 've been mostly using my merkur 37c slant and decided to try the again that only confirmed my earlier findings it shave very well , but really does n't get you as close as other razors , perhaps it 's on the safe side and might be good for some people if i were you , i would n't pay more than about 20 italian barber website has the jaws open comb razor for 20 that might be a more interesting razor to try 12 14 2015 i do n't know why i 've been this razor i 've been using my cheap plastic feather razor , which is quite good occasionally would use my merkur slant yesterday i decided to try the open comb again very nice , zero \( used proraso again \) my only comment it is not as close \( ever so slightly \) compared to my other razors i mean my face looked clean and was smooth to touch , but i could feel a little with my hand against the growth this despite shaving first and then it 's really as close as this razor gets 06 06 2015 used a fresh astra sp blade with this and my proraso white \( green tea and oatmeal \) soap one of the better shaves i 've had zero definitely a mild razor , took me a little extra time to do all the buffing everywhere , but perhaps with the advantage of minimal burn i will try it with feather , sword and merkur blades that i have on hand to sample so far i 've changed to 5 stars for the price of twenty one bucks it 's really a great value and could easily be someone 's first safety razor aside from this razor i also have a van der hagen \( butterfly one piece , got it from target \) and a merkur 37c slant bar \( 2 piece \) i like that this razor is also a 3 piece i like having the 3 different types the 3 piece is the best for traveling if you need a very compact package you could and pack this into an tin \) the handle is thinner than my merkur 37c slant bar , but for me it seems just as comfortable the finish on the components appears to be flawless \( unfortunately with chrome plating that is no guarantee of resistance , but we 'll see \) i will update as i keep using it i sure wish there was also a closed comb version of this razor ! for the money \( around 20 \) it 's a great quality razor ! it 's not as massive as some of the other razors , but still substantial enough , slightly heavier than all the asian made instead of being thicker cast brass , the middle piece \( guard \) is just a bent plate , with the top fitting over it very simple , but effective the only reason this ca n't be someone 's only razor is because trimming straight lines \( i e \) is not as easy due to the open comb teeth
3	i got this for my wife and she decidedly did not like it i personally found the scent a bit strong and probably more suited for a different age bracket i first thought powder puff when i smelled it but my wife said it was a sophisticated scent with elements of citrus , musk , wood , vanilla as i have learned from modern , a parfum intended to be differently by different people , this fragrance could be in a highly subjective manner thus , it is quite difficult to write a fragrance which is differently by various i found that this product did not last more then 1 hour at which time the scent faded to nothing as such , i suppose it would need to be applied more frequently than some products overall we ultimately gifted this product to someone who loves it neither of us preferred the scent and our daughter did n't like it either however , each person is different
3	while i did find a reduction in flakiness , the rose hips nourishing oil was not irritant free i felt a stinging sensation when applied to my entire face which has patches of sensitive skin while the stinging went away within a few minutes it prevented me from applying the oil per the directions of twice a day it may be that i reacted to ingredients in addition to the rose hips oil as this is not a pure oil
5	nothing i can say other than love , love , love ! do n't need much to make it work price might one away , but does last a long time and my blond is beautiful never brassy or dull
5	excellent coverage it 's waterproof does n't once it 's set just remember to go lightly and build thin layers blending till you have covered and concealed applying thin layers and allow each layer to set you will be rewarded worth the price highly recommend
4	love this color i could n't find it anywhere in the stores it was sold out you need a top coat for sure !
5	the product is odorless , and really does disappear into your skin , not greasy at all it protected my skin well in florida sun the nicest feeling sunscreen i 've ever used
4	pretty color , but not as opaque as i 'd hoped even with 3 coats , the white of my nails is visible
5	is a nice fresh color not too bright but does freshen up my face creamy texture and goes on smoothly which i like and i do n't mind reapplying it as i see fit i would buy it again
5	a must have for any hair gives shine and healthy manageability !
5	love anything from jane and this eyeshadow is no exception the color on this grey shadow is lighter than it appears in the online photo still happy with my purchase !
5	love their colors !
5	great line of polishes with less toxicity pretty colors good wearability
5	ive been a loyal clarisonic user for nearly 4 years i started with the mia 2 and over the years have been lucky enough to own the clarisonic smart profile , opal and now the mia fit i was very excited to try this because i love the brands products and am always curious whether a newer model is better than what im already using in case you 're new to clarisonic or unfamiliar with their face brushes , the big selling point is that they are more effective at cleaning your skin than cleanser and hands alone and that the brushes also help with exfoliation without a lab or testing methods of my own its hard to truly prove out that claim , but i can say that i used to be someone with troubled acne prone skin and its been well managed over the past few years with a routine that includes the clarisonic \( though its hard to 100 attribute it to the clarisonic since i do , have many other products in my routine and since my acne is hormonal its very likely there have been some shifts in my cycle hormone levels over the years \) every clarisonic facial brush \( this one included \) has left my skin feeling very clean and soft having also tried other knockoff versions i can also say that clarisonic just feels better the device itself feels more premium and substantial and the brushes feel more pleasant on your skin \( and represent a larger range for a variety of skin types and concerns \) and i also appreciate their longevity my first mia 2 is still going strong and although the charging cord for my opal had some issues it was replaced at no cost by the manufacturer slightly before the 2 year warranty already convinced that clarisonic brand makes the best facial cleaning brushes , i was curious how this model would compare to other models i had tried from a functionality perspective , this seems very similar to the mia 2 both have two cleaning settings delicate and power universal , depending on the model according to the website , the two settings with the mia fit are new \( and very gentle \) vs older models , but personally i cant tell the difference the biggest difference i can notice seems to be that the mia fit is more compact and sits upright on its own because of this difference it feels a little different in your hand of all 3 models i own , i personally think the mia 2 feels the most natural and ergonomic in my petite hands however , i imagine this is largely a matter of personal preference if this is something you 're concerned about it could be worth a trip to a beauty store where you can handle all the devices in person , like sephora , to do research before buying the big advantage of the compact design is that its more space friendly if you take your clarisonic on the go either traveling or to the gym i did n't necessarily find the size of the mia 2 to be an , but the smart profile is definitely bigger than i would like for travel i think part of what makes this more suitable for travel is the shape , being a more uniform overall size vs curved which does tend to pack better when you 're squeezing it in a toiletries bag with other items i also really like the new radiance brush head when i first got my clarisonic i found that the brush heads were a bit more abrasive , and as such i only used them every other day or 2x a week with my dry skin but the brushes have become a lot more plush over time so you can use them more regularly overall , im a huge fan of this device i still think the smart profile is my favorite since it is the most multi purpose for face and body cleaning , but as someone who travels a lot this gets used the most since i do n't hesitate to throw it in my gym bag or suitcase what model you choose to go with is a largely personal decision depending on how you plan to use it more on the go mia fit is a great fit largely at home and on the face mia 2 is perfect want to clean your face , body and feat opt for the smart profile but no matter what you pick i think they make great products and it is hard to go wrong
4	i ended up liking this as a moisturizer more than i thought i would it 's very light and absorbs almost instantly i have rather oily skin for my age and this does n't add to it at all , despite being an oil like texture when dispensed the smell is a little strong as others have noted at first , but i find that it disappears as soon as i put it on it 's kind of a men 's cologne smell , but not unpleasant at all this is a rather expensive serum and i'm not sure i would have spent this much if i had not received it from the vine program i 've been using it for about a week and unless it does something amazing my regular moisturizer does n't do , i doubt i will purchase it myself
5	i love this eyebrow mousse and it looks like blinc is discontinuing it i would love to hear if anyone who tried this mousse in any of the shades can recommend something comparable and long lasting
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	i like this conditioner it made my hair soft and made my beard softer , which my wife appreciated i liked the smell the reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that , to me , it does n't really stand out from any other conditioners i 've used it 's good but not phenomenal
5	i'm not a teen , have n't been for many years , but i still get breakouts these breakouts are primarily on my chin but i used this toner all over my face i started with once a day since my skin in sensitive and i did n't want to dry it out the results were noticeable , with the breakout i had clearing up and no others popping up so far , i have n't needed to increase to more than once a day i use it at night , then moisturize like i normally do good results
5	beautiful color
5	i use sunscreen everyday under my makeup because i am in my mid 40 's and sun damage and sun spots are a part of my life now i do a lot of walking outside and this lotion lasts better than my last lotion \( which was recommended from my dermatologist \) this goes on dry and is not oily at all \( love that \) and spreads evenly i have not had any issues with breakouts and if i was going to have problems i usually know within the first couple of days so far this is turning to be my preferred daily sunscreen for the intense colorado sun ! i will update my review if i have any side effects in the future , but so far , i love everything about it
5	as expected nice blue color
4	so far so good i have n't used it for a month yet so i do n't know how well it will work on dark spots , which is what i am hoping for that it will lighten this one i have right next to my ear it feels good going on i am using it nightly and my skin feels nice and soft i'm nor sure about using it super thick as a masque as suggested , it absorbs pretty quickly i 'd have to glob it on my face just to glob it on my face to be honest , that seems a bit to me
4	very nice white polish it 's a little streaky , but i could have just gotten a mediocre batch
4	i like this product it does n't dry out my face , but it does leave a strange film on the skin i do what other reviewers have recommended and wipe my face with toner afterwards to remove the rest of the residue i personally do n't mind and enjoy the product , but i do n't recommend it for people who prefer a highly cleansing and clarifying mask
5	i was skeptical now so happy my eyebrows were very thin and i was not happy with the way they looked tried latisse before from my doctor and it may have helped a bit but not much and you have to have prescription or get from doctor and it is more expensive than this i have been using this product since december and i have noticed a difference in the last two weeks a real difference i do n't even use everyday , i forget sometimes eyebrows are much thicker and growing in around the edges i really did not need thicker lashes but i use it on my lashes a few times a week and i do notice a difference there as well i love this !
4	this is a very good shampoo that helps my hair shine and look healthy i love the eucalyptus scent it 's not super strong or annoying but a nice invigorating scent that enhances the shower experience the only thing i do n't like is that it provides almost no lather because of that , i probably end up using more than i need i doubt i would buy the product after it 's gone because the cost is so high
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
4	first of all , let me say that i'm completely in love with this brush ! i 've never used a brush to apply liquid foundation before i usually use my fingers or a beauty blender sponge and this is a ! my foundation goes on so much more evenly , and it 's very easy to build up coverage in certain areas the bristles do tend to suck up the liquid , so i am using more foundation than normal , but with these results , it 's worth it ! the brush seems to be very good quality , too i expect it to last a long time here 's what i do n't like there are only minimal instructions for use \( you can see them in the pictures of the product by the description \) , and there are no cleaning instructions i 've been washing mine with a little hand soap , and that seems to be working fine for now , but i would have appreciated instructions also , i have absolutely no idea if it really exfoliates like it claims to , and i'm not sure how i would even be able to tell overall , it 's a great brush , and i 'd highly recommend it if you can justify the price !
4	a little expensive
4	this is a gentle exfoliator rating it 4 stars mainly because i did n't care for the aroma \( somewhat strong \) and i think it is way over priced i am 60 years old and do not have crepe issues , but i do have aging skin and sagging issues i have used this for two weeks now i will state that my skin is a lot smoother than it was before i used it and it does appear to be more hydrated \( considering i am in florida , that is a strong plus \) however , for the money , i could buy products for exfoliating and get the same or better results \( and much less a cost \) as i do not have major issues , i cannot say whether this products works \( which may justify the cost \) , but for my needs it is an excellent exfoliator and i know i could do better price wise for same
5	this is my favorite facial scrub i love the smell and it cleans my face really good i love mario badescu products
5	this stuff very smooth , very moisturizing got it as a gift and reordered it as soon as it ran out !
2	im use to essie polishes being of better quality i had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off
5	i ove the navy blue with just the finest hint of sparkle , not too teenage y looking and perfect for fall !
5	i bought this topcoat to seal the nail polish strips i started using recently it kept my nails shiny and chip free when i was ready to remove the polish , it practically fell off it did n't even take 5 minutes
5	love this product
4	okay so i like how easy it is to apply with the brush which i have never seen before but it is kinda expensive i like using this on acne spots i have and that 's it i never wear foundation so this is nice and light on my face convenient design as well so it can be used on the go
3	this age defying hand mask from karuna really did make my hands feel soft and smooth but not really any softer or smoother than when i cover my hands in a good , moisturizing cream and then put on vinyl gloves and let it work for 20 minutes you get one set of gloves enough for one treatment just put your hands in the gloves and tape the attached wrist strap around your wrist , massage your hands through the gloves and then wait 20 minutes before removing and tossing the gloves notice that there is an inner pair of fabric like gloves so be sure to put your hands inside the inner pair of gloves it 's a somewhat oily cream so you will need to rinse your hands after removing the gloves my hands definitely look and feel smoother and younger and well hydrated after using this hand mask but again , no more so than when i do it myself at home with my own hand cream and gloves i put the cream on my hand and then slip on a pair of thin , cotton gloves and then pull on latex gloves over that and wait while this is very convenient \( i do n't have to wash gloves afterward \) and the cream is of high quality , it 's just too expensive for my budget
5	best facial mask product works better than anything else i have ever tried
4	good product i bought these to use before micro dermabrasion and they work well for that not too harsh the only issue i have with them is that they are very thin and hard to separate i always end up having to handle a second pad to get the first i worry about contamination since the second pad goes back in the jar and sits there for a few days
5	i 've searched long and high for a tinted moisturizer sunblock foundation that was n't too heavy , did n't break my sensitive skin out , and made my skin look good who would have guessed it would be this weird stuff goes on great , either with fingertips or sponge lasts all day no color fade , transfer , or change pores look good i'm sure i love it so much that it 's destined to be discontinued any second !
5	natural looking blush that your husband will not only like but think that the blush of spring is now natural , but we wo n't tell him different !
4	love vinylux wear ability , but this is not a very electric color expected it to be more vibrant
5	this is a lighter , fruitier fragrance with slight overtones of jasmine and spice in with the citrus notes even when initially applied , it is n't cloying or overpowering it is delicate enough so that even if you find perfumes to be initially overwhelming , you probably wo n't have that problem with rochas eau sensuelle upon application the citrus notes this lends the fragrance an appealing freshness that is subtle enough so that as it begins to mature on the skin and the floral elements come to the fore , it retains its appeal even as the aroma becomes more complex the various elements of the fragrance do n't clash as they are released on the skin , an unfortunate attribute which can give lesser perfumes a slightly unpleasant which i find off putting there is a pleasant and attractive balance of fragrances that is revealed over the 4 6 hours of a single application 's efficacy the rochas eau sensuelle is a subtle and delicate blend of citrus , floral and spice elements which make this an appealing fragrance
4	i love the feel of this sponge on my face i used to use a clarisonic but this has a nice feel to it and does n't take as long for the clean skin feeling it left my skin feeling soft and refreshed i used it with my favorite nia 24 cleanser
5	i get eczema occasionally and it stays in mean patches this product ill use instead of fancy creams on my face and keeps the moisture locked in the glycerin keeps it soft the smell goes away in a couple minutes i use it over my just to lock in the moisture keeps my eczema away ! ! no other product has in all my life also great for dry skin bumps on arms ! ! !
5	i am a beauty product addict price doesnt matter to me , ill try anything , and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion my fave hair serum is 5 my fave face cream is 200 i mention this only because i want to be clear that i am not attracted to only higher end lines that said , i tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer but as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning , and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays \( if im lucky \) , i always struggle with this i also do n't want to use a flat iron every day , because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color i stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner searching for products with a more natural lean , although i know some people have issues with some ingredients here my hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this , and a little bit of my fave hair serum , and its almost perfect \( its only ever perfect when i flat iron ! \) soemtimes i do n't even use the serum , and its still great the conditioner also has really helped with damaged ends
1	this is gray , not gray green , just gray not as described or pictured not eligible for return buyer beware
4	very nice lipgloss the applicator brush is easy to use and allows you to line and fill easily the lipgloss has a nice sheen , feels very comfortable to wear and is n't sticky or tacky feeling it 's not a lip stain so do n't expect all day coverage , however , it does last a long time for lipgloss the color is very opaque in my opinion it 's more like a blend of a lipstick with a high sheen than just the sheer lipgloss this particular shade \( 4 \) , is very pink i would call it carnation pink
3	this does help but not really any better than my normal which are a lot cheaper
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
4	this has a great shine , pearly , and i bought to layer with another color i do not wear this as a stand alone polish , just too light for my taste
4	a lot of lip glosses turn me off with either taste scent or a watery texture this one is not sticky \( though i like sticky glosses \) but it is not watery either it stays in place well and feels nice the particular color is n't great for me as it has just a bit too much blue undertone to flatter me , but that is just my particular coloring it would be a knockout on someone else will definitely look at other shades of jouer lip gloss
5	excelente
5	all mario products are great , but this was a nice little luxury to add on top
5	my husband and i both love this soap what a step up from ordinary bathing ! it has a delicious scent that for me is gender neutral it cleans well without drying i recommend a soap dish that has raised areas to allow air to the orange stripe lasts longer if it can dry we are long time fans of this company but this is our first bar soap from them were both very pleased and will repurchase
4	love it
5	pca products are terrific all of them ! all of them ! each and every single one of the pca products is great !
4	i guess , if you are a strong believer in all natural cosmetics products the product description promises a lotion that is alcohol free , colorant free , paraben free , sulfate free , certified organic ingredients , vegan , suitable for all skin types , cruelty free , safe for sensitive skin , dermatologist tested as far as these promises are concerned , i can attest that the lotion works very well on my very sensitive , allergy prone skin i like how creamy this lotion is , and i love the scent it reminds me of being at a spa too bad the scent doesnt linger on my skin longer once i am out of shower , the scent is gone in moments is the lotion super hydrating and moisturizing \? in my experience , the end effect is very similar to the one i get from my regular dove soap i like this lotion a lot , but i honestly can justify the price 4 stars for the quality of the product only
3	i'm not a connoisseur of different brands , but when i did an online search , essie and opi came up as as some of the better brands i chose essie because of the colors that so many of the other reviews where raving about however , i liked the color of this nail polish better on the screen than on my nails but the color is objective , it probably just does n't go with my skin tone the quality seems good i had to put on about 3 thin coats to get a solid color , and if you dry them well in between , it will stay on for at least 5 or 6 days
4	i have been using this cream day and night for 20 days now at first i figured that nothing would change but that at the very least i would have a moisturized face my opinion has changed i actually do see a difference ! at about day 13 i realized that my skin looked different it looks more refined , smoother if you will my face has an over all fresher , not so dry and tired look my makeup goes on easier and looks better as well i am not one to say something works when it does not and am pretty skeptical overall so , i really mean it when i say that this is working on me this cream has a scent that is fresh , slightly citric and reminds me of going to a spa i enjoy putting the cream on because of the light scent i will note again that i am not typically a person that would like scented cream i love the smell of this you can read all of the ingredients from the pictures and all of the claims for this extreme cream in the notes already posted i surely ca n't tell if the cream has a defense from environmental factors or if it is actually strengthening my skin i can say that is smells great and has made a difference in my skin texture and moisture level maybe over the long term i will see my fine lines diminish as it claims i read some reviews saying that the cream irritated their skin so i looked up strivectin products and they suggest trying their creams every other or every 3rd day if you only have a mild irritation maybe that would help i have an issue with the cost of this product at 90 bucks for 1 oz , many people ca n't afford this if it is possible it would be great if the price could be lowered since it only last about 6 months
5	we love this stuff ! mustela bath gels are the best for keeping clean a single product for the hair and body means not a ton of mess around the tub \( and more room for \) plus , no issues when it gets in little guy 's eyes while rinsing his hair
4	thanks !
5	the baxter of california hydro salve lip balm is the best lip balm i have ever used many years ago , i used chapstick nbsp but it began making my lips red and inflamed then i switched to vaseline lip therapy nbsp and have been using it ever since i tried to use the nivea lip butter \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nivea lip butter tin smooth kiss 0 59 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 nivea lip butter tin , smooth kiss , 0 59 ounce a \) , which works well but i do n't like having to touch the butter with my fingers and spreading it over my lips it is not sanitary touching your lips with unwashed fingers is a good way to catch a cold or flu i was to try the baxter of california hydro salve lip balm \( mojito flavor \) its citrusy smell and taste is heavenly the lip balm , thanks to the slanted , lipstick like applicator , glides smoothly onto my lips i do n't need to use my fingers to apply it also , the cap remains on securely i do n't have to worry about it coming off while i carry the tube in my tight jeans most importantly , the balm keeps my lips from becoming chapped and , after using it for nearly two weeks , i have n't experienced any allergic reactions also , the tube has a design that appeals to both males and females it is what i refer to as gender friendly in the future , i will definitely be purchasing this lip balm from baxter of california in fact , i would love to try more of their products such as their deodorant \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baxter of california deodorant citrus and herbal musk dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 baxter of california deodorant , citrus and herbal musk a \) , daily face wash \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baxter of california daily face wash 10 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 baxter of california daily face wash , 10 fl oz a \) and hand and body moisturizer \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baxter of california hand and body moisturizer 10 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 baxter of california hand and body moisturizer , 10 fl oz a \) all these luxurious hygiene products appear to be gender friendly they would make practical stocking stuffers for the upcoming holiday season b
5	love the product
5	foams and feels very clean
5	my toner of choice i use it just about every day if my skin is raw from my skin condition \( lichen planus \) i hold off for a day or two because it can burn a little because of the aha it contains , but when i have more or less normal skin , i use it on a cotton ball or two , making sure to get my neck too , and it makes my skin feel so clean and tightens up my pores love this stuff !
5	okay here 's my grand daughter 's comments great gloss exotic ingredients and aroma are elements that along with the look when applied make her feel like a movie star when she wears it the applicator takes some getting used to price is a bit much overall look and effect very nice she 's saving it for special occasions and dates she wishes there were a squeeze tube of the same thing because it 's easier to carry and use on the run especially for college girls it wears well she had no irritation from the gloss at all and it lasted longer than her regular brand would she buy it again yes ! her rating five stars
3	if a product performs reasonably well and as claimed , i try to leave price out of the when reviewing it since , all other things being equal , its an individual decision whether to pay a premium for something however , the price really is a deciding factor for me when considering the vincent longo water canvas base , especially considering that it 's less than an ounce in size and doesnt replace foundation makeup i tested this by using it on one side of my face and following my usual daily regimen on the other side , and i could definitely feel a difference they started out very similar , but the water canvas base side stayed smoother throughout the day and did provide a better base for makeup the results were n't , but they were noticeable however , id have to see a much bigger difference before i would consider this to be worth using regularly at this price point for under 20 , i would probably add it to my makeup routine for over 40 , i wouldnt even consider it
5	this is pure heaven i love this product it is a great moisturizer and my skin just drinks it up i put it on after the shower and feel ready to the world this is a much better buy than at the stores i personally like the slight soapy smell it makes me feel clean do your self a favor and get this wonderful bargain your skin will love you for it
5	would order again !
5	these pads are just the right size they 're large enough to clean my entire face and neck it 's great for oily skin and leaves a nice fresh scent
5	this is a high quality , durable , base coat for your nails it goes on smooth and dries quickly the odor is a bit strong , as all acrylic nail polishes are , but the smell fades in reasonable time 3 days after i have applied this to my dry , clean , nails , i have no chipping the shine is great this is good for a base coat that is all you want on your nails for that freshly look or for base under and over a color it 's worth the money because it does n't peel after a few days i recommend it
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	this stuff works alot better than the gel , this jar has lasted 6 months so far this size will be good for a year i shave every day
4	i found this to go on easily and smoothly and the color being as expected i have sensitive eyes , and this did not cause any irritation
5	love it
4	i do like this facial kit be advised that all the sizes in this kit are more sample sizes \( not full sizes \) , but they are great to give the product line a try , and are also perfect for travel i love that this skin care kit is organic i really like to know what i'm putting on my skin my skin feels nice and clean after using this \( although i tend to not like moisturizer with sunscreen , so i have n't been using that one it tends to leave my combination skin feeling oily after a while \) my favorite products are the serum and the night cream i do n't really care for the gel cleanser as it goes on lightly but it does n't really do much as far as i can tell i prefer something that lathers a bit and the peel is ok i 've used it twice , and both times i left it on for the suggested 10 minutes , and rinsed it off , but did not feel the warmth or tingling that they said would happen being 100 honest , i like the somme institute skin care line better my skin feels really good when i'm using that set , and it is proven to be good for your skin as well so this set is good , but i like that one better
3	is it real or an imitation i got this on a free trial and my wife was thrilled she 'd used retinol products with great results before i went and checked reviews and found several reviewers thinking this is a pretend to be real product , my wife was wondering the same my wife swears by obagi but seriously questions this one given the price point , i do n't think she will be replacing this when it is gone several other obagi products seem to be getting reformulated and one by one she is moving away from them it would be interesting to know if these are real obagi products which have been reformulated or if they are across the line from other online
5	very good
5	although some face creams and lotions take awhile to work , this product is designed to have an immediate effect on your eyes and lips and it really does work ! when i wake up in the morning , i have puffy eyes due to allergies , and the metal applicator tip on this soothes them right away it immediately plumps up the undereye and lip area , and smooths out those little lines that those of us who are past our mid 30 's \( i'm 44 \) start getting my package did n't come with an insert about how to use this , so these are the instructions that vichy has given lip contours spread a small amount of cream around the lips upper lip massage delicately using circular lower lip smooth in a backwards and movement to the corners of the lips slide the applicator under the lower lip from right to left , and repeat the movement from left to right eye contours spread a small amount of cream around the eye place the tip of the applicator at the inner corner of the eye and smooth it perform small circular in this area at the outside corner , make a few clockwise i 've found that this also plays well with my other lotions and makeup , and it does n't pill or ball up since it works so well to de puff morning eyes , though , i tend to use this right when i wake up , right after washing my face , which also gives it time to sink in before i apply makeup i'm really impressed with all the vichy products i 've tried so far !
2	they say , no pain , no gain this product works but , it comes at a price
2	not happy with this and it 's the condition it arrived in that 's the problem the highlighter was all broken up and it was impossible to put it back together in a cake so that it could be used with a brush or a sponge it was certainly packed well , in a double box with no signs of rough handling , so it must have been through something really wild to have arrived in this condition too bad , because i was looking forward to seeing the effect
5	truth and flare is a beautiful spring color , i love it !
5	it 's nail polish it was unopened , it was the color i wanted , and it arrived relatively quickly what more can i say \?
4	this detox night cream absorbs very well into your skin , but it would be hard to stretch two pumps to cover all the face and neck , as the marketing describes the smell is not strong , and not particularly pleasant or unpleasant slightly floral the concealed pump head is a neat design will update later on results
2	this dries crispy and crunchy this should be sold as hair gel , seriously i'm not giving up on this brand though as i have n't tried their petroleum based pomades yet
5	this blush is great and i 've tried many , mostly powder which on drier aging skin does n't work as well also liquid blush is too runny and seeps into the pores jouer tint is a perfect cream base i put it on after moisturizing and it blends well and stays on the color i'm using is petal , and it is perfect for my medium light complexion it can be used on lips , but i found the color a little light and somewhat too matt for my look i have sensitive skin and this blush tint did n't cause any problems great product
5	i purchased this for my son 's girlfriend and i'm so happy she grew to like this it 's perfect for her because she is new to retinol it did like it should with a good retinol have a mild burning sensation which once she used several times it went away she went through a little peeling process and i do n't mean her whole face just areas that are dry is where it peeled which that too is normal for some after i noticed her face was clear , smooth and healthy looking what a difference this has made i'm so to the sellers here on amazon that are able to offer this at an affordable price to customers i never question the authenticity of their products because i have used some products for years and after comparing them to the ones i purchased at my dermatologist i found the two are exactly the same only difference is the price lucky for us the 's sellers can buy in bulk and sell to use much cheaper will buy the stronger percentage for her once this bottle is gone
3	i just had to try this because it was created to target hard to treat creepy looking skin i have a lot of creepy skin because i'm an who spent years in the sun , before we knew the sun was so bad for us the directions say to take a pearl sized piece and massage it into the skin for up to a minute it would take me an hour long massage to treat all of my skin so i 've been trying it on my right hand and wrist for a few days , it does take a while to absorb , and my skin feels tacky at first , but that goes away i find the fragrance very light as a control , i 've been using a natural goat 's milk product on my left area crepe erase is doing a slightly better job i 'll probably save this very expensive creme for my neck area
3	the color looks just as good on as it does in the bottle \( if you use a super shiny topcoat \) , but the formula is pretty awful it went on super gloopy and dried extremely fast making it hard to work with and despite my buffer , base coat , and seche vite top coat , the polish chipped the next day it reminds me of butler please gorgeous color , but do n't expect it to last more than one day on your nails
5	great for sensitive skin did not give my skin any issues after using it has a nice rich lather with a very clean scent its a very mild aroma and it makes you feel clean it rinses clean off my face did n't feel at all greasy or filmy after rinsing it off you do need to follow up with a moisturizer because it will leave your skin dry
4	i love it
5	gorgeous , deep color that looks great on all skin tones nice consistency and great shine another example of color and quality from essie brand great price from company , too
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	i 've been using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href roc retinol correxion eye cream 0 5 ounce pack of 2 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 roc retinol correxion eye cream , 0 5 ounce pack of 2 a nbsp under my eyes for several years now and can say it absolutely does work to diminish fine lines around the eyes that one only costs about 15 per tube , so i was eager to see if this much more expensive strivectin ar would deliver a better result in a word , no i used the strivectin on my right eye twice daily , and the roc cream on the left after several weeks , both eyes appear to be the same i 'll continue my little experiment , but unless something amazing happens on the strivectin side , i would not buy another tube
3	i like it color does not look like the picture though it 's a lot darker
5	another beautiful color , i am loving this
3	i decided to give this a try although hardly any guys have reviewed this we men , especially older ones , have our blemishes and age spots well , this product seems to be working moderately well it is oily and that i do n't particularly like dark spots under my eyes look better and overall it 's okay , definitely better than nothing used at all a little dab goes a long ways and of course , that i like this is hardly an essential , but i rather favor it however , i'm not sure i 'll buy more when this tube runs out
4	bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do i had to use a high gloss top coat i also had to layer up to get the desired coverage i wanted i would describe the color as barbie pink and i love it
5	i used this sunscreen when i in maui the suncreen is a little thicker than the daily use , and stayed on well when i was at the beach did n't get sunburned
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	great shampoo really great for dry , thin hair i have alot of hair , but it is fine , and it is hard to find a hair product that keeps my hair moisturized love this shampoo , but it will burn your eyes tingles when you use it i used another shampoo after this , and it left my hair dull and weak this shampoo is the best !
2	nothing great , did n't really meet my expectations for the price point plenty of other mens shampoo you could buy i 'll buy anthony 's logistics for men before i buy this stuff
4	i have sensitive skin this did not burn it is very cooling i thought my eyes looked less puffy you need very little this will last month 's i did not notice less wrinkles though i do n't have dark circles so i cannot state if they are less noticeable with this product
2	really dried out my skin it cleaned my face just fine , but i felt dry after instead of refreshed and renewed
5	this is a very pleasant smelling product it does say on the front of the bottle removes make up residue and impurities which might lead one to believe you just use this to remove make up however on the back of the bottle it says to follow cleansing with this product to remove residue and impurities you apply with a cotton pad and do not need to rinse it contains no alcohol , but does have castor oil it is made in france for those that might be arrived with no seal or protective cover my face did feel toned and fresh after using this
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
3	this setting spray works reasonably well and last reasonably well once applied the problem i have is with the instructions you are supposed to hold this a few inches away from your face , close your eyes , and spray 4 6 times in an x and t shaped pattern the first time i tried that , just as instructed , i ended up with a dripping wet face and had to start all over with fresh foundation since then , i 've found that two sprays are sufficient without soaking my face of course , this means i can do a t shape or an x shape , but not both it does n't cause an adverse reaction in me , and is a fairly neutral smell when lightly applied , it does n't interfere with makeup , but does help to set it , as it should but practice before the first time you use it on your carefully made up face , or you may be frustrated , as i was , with a wet face that does nothing to enhance your looks
5	beautiful love
3	nice variety of samples but thought i could use the 20 credit to purchase a full size version of any product included in the beauty box instead , i am limited to only those items featured on the terms and conditions too bad now , i'm stuck purchasing something i really did n't want if i want to use the credit or end up paying 20 for a bunch of samples either way , not a good deal
3	i'm a beginner when it comes to applying my own shellac i 've purchased 5 colors so far hollywood , red baroness , tropix , iced cappuccino , and iced coral i 've found the iced colors are much more difficult to use and have n't gotten good results with either color the matte colors are much easier to apply thinly and smoothly i have n't given up on the iced colors , but think i need more experience before i can get good results com is a great website for videos and tips she has a great video on trouble shooting and mentions that the iced colors are difficult my iced cappuccino application ended up streaky and so i removed it immediately
4	this was a tough product to judge first of all it works , and it works within a few days it crazy works however , my facial skin was way to sensitive for this serum it burned quite a bit , for quite a while and two days later it was still sore when i used my gently exfoliator after the first application and the burning , i decided to use it on my hands that have horrible liver spots and i am way too young for those ! lol too many years of sun exposure here 's the thing the skin on the back of my hands did not get affected at all from this product and the spots all but disappeared on my left hand the huge ugly spots on my right hand are still there , but they have gone from deep ugly brown to a cafe color in no time at all i think if you could live with this on your face , you would bleach yourself all one color in no time unfortunately , i ca n't use it on my face , just my hands and it works really well
5	if you can get past the fact that this is an aerosol and not a spritz spray then i 'd say its very comparable to urban decay 's all nighter makeup setting spray it felt odd using an aerosol at first but it certainly held up in the makeup department no smudged mascara shadow all day ! tip do not spray directly onto face \( i could never get it evenly distributed doing it this way \) rather spray the air a few inches above and in front of your face and step into the spray this ensures an even coat of setting spray all over the face pricey but recommended
4	delicacy is closer to a light peach or pink peach shade with a very muted shimmer very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point
5	great gets hot , perfect
4	it soothes the skin without being too heavy it is a good , thick cream for skin conditions other than diaper rash as well kort
4	gentle , yet seems to be effective i wish the scent was more lemony , but , it has a bit of a muted lemon tone i like the face wash best
5	i absolutely love the finished look from using vita liberata 's self tanning mousse ! i did buy famous dave 's 2 sided taking mitt to apply my self tanners with i had been using jergens tanning lotion , but i was darker with 1 use of this mousse than i was with 2 weeks using jergens i like that the mousse is colored , so you can tell when it is rubbed in good i did n't have any problems with streaking , except i went too heavy on my toes and area my mistake , though my only complaint is the price for the small size of the bottle vita liberata carries a lotion that is twice the size for about the same price i do n't feel i get as tan from it , though the color i get from this mousse is a nice golden brown i love this , because i normally tan a reddish gold the brown looks much nicer plus , the mousse dries very quickly
3	looks the same as black and smudges for some odd reason do n't have that issue with the black color
5	this works well on your skin and does n't dry it out or leave a residue it works especially well for anybody of any age who suffers from any degree of acne , whether it is a severe case of outbreak or adult acne that involves the rare breakout this one has worked well in the past and continues to do so
4	this works well for removing make up i had to use three cotton balls with this cleanser to get every trace of foundation off my face i like this cleansing water but stick with my usually of a foaming cleanser as it actually saves me more time in the long run and is cheaper than using a cleaning water
5	i was looking a finish like this for a long time it 's just what i want ! ! ! little bit pink and transparent
5	this really does disguise thinning hair i am a female with thin hair due to medication this keeps my part from looking too wide looks normal natural
1	i really loved the color , and that 's why i gave it one star after i put the polish on , it was bubbly , it was very thick to put on , like polish does when it gets older , really disappointed since this was my first essie polish purchase
2	i have average skin , not pale , not dark i'm what the ladies and gentlemen at sephora call a perfect candidate for bronzer they showed me repeatedly what a great benefit it would be to make me look , healthy , sunny \( without skin cancer danger \) and even slimmer ! yep , the of goodness but it does n't some bronzers are okay \( the bare escentuals light one seems okay \) but the rest make me feel like my face is dirty even just a light dusting feels like i'm sprinkling dirt on my face so i eagerly tried this , because if it makes me one pound slimmer it 's a win , right \? no it just felt like dirt something about the texture , no matter how much i blended , felt like i had a sticky powder on my face it is heavy on the pigment and not easy to blend in the first place but even when i had a friend put it on me , it just stuck out as omg that lady must have been of a factory explosion ! ! ! ! i do n't know if it 's me or bliss \( i like their other products immensely \) maybe it 's me , but my friend tried it too , her with a darker complexion , neither of us was happy try to sample before buying although i'm sure amazon would accept a return
4	goes on smoothly it covers blemishes , freckles , and age spots quite well it blends easily and cannot be seen once foundation is applied it is a very small package of concealer this is great as it fits in the purse but , because i think it is not in line with the price , i took a star away
5	this took a few tries before i got it looking the way i wanted i now only use this and skip liquid foundation i really like that it gives me just a little hint darker than my current color without looking fake or cakey i use this , the concealer and i use my regular powder to set and i really like the way it looks on my face
5	this product is a good one and i like it so much !
5	love this color so far it 's been over a week and no chips
1	i originally wrote a good review for this product as it seemed to diminish wrinkles , however be aware i went to my dermatologist showed her attached pic and she also had recent pics of my neck she said there 's a chemical that decreases fatty tissues which is why it 's not recommended for face she suggested i use remaining product for my elbows , knew , and i have a long , thin neck with little fatty tissues i'm now paying for to go back to where i was before nectifirm
3	i ordered the caramel , and let me tell you there is nothing caramel about the color it 's beige this is one of the problems i have with buying non african american make up products many rarely get the colors right as we come in an array of colors it 's very hard purchasing our products online as we have to actually be somewhere that we can actually test the product before we buy it needless to say this product was too light and did n't have any brown pigments in it it did eventually blend in when i applied darker foundation , and it set well when i used the translucent concealing powder , but it took some time to blend it it did last all day , but honestly , i ca n't tell if it was the concealer or the foundation that i mixed in with it i will try a darker color and pray it 's not too dark
4	i like how this curls my hair i have long hair and this curls each section with ease it curls fast and the curls stay in all day ! my only complaint and why i did not give it 5 stars is because of how the cord twists up and makes it hard to curl with i have to continually manually the cord so that i can continue curling other than that annoyance i love it
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
4	i like ! smells manly
3	i own and use a lot of mustela products and generally adore all of them , however this product is a bit strange it smells and looks almost identical to the no rinse cleaning micellar water \( which in my opinion , is probably one of the best products they make \) but when applied on the hair \( as recommended on the label , it can be used for hair styling \) it does n't serve any purpose except to it with a scent i cant see a need or occasion to spray this on baby 's body other than to freshen up between diaper changes , however the mist is certainly quite fine in case you are so inclined to do so perhaps when my newborn is older it will be useful to have to freshen up in summer
1	too many large glitter pieces , just looks clumpy and cant smooth even with many top coats who wants nails \?
4	this is a very dark matte color it goes on smooth and easy and leaves your lips feeling smooth and soft long after it has faded off this goes on dark and is a hard color to pull off it is a deep red with almost a hint of purple it last for a while and stains your lips for even longer
4	i 've heard so much about this brand on my favorite beauty blogs so i had to finally give it a try i like it very much ! this is not an everyday skin cleanser you 're only supposed to use it twice a week i will say when i use it my skin feels very soft it does n't take much to clean your face so this bottle will last me a long time there 's no smell , and i can have sensitive skin and i had no reaction to this it 's a great face cleanser for the price i'm going to try more from this line
4	xen tan 's products continue to me this tan lotion really does work i used it on my legs , and that 's probably the darkest they 've been in my life \( artificially or naturally \) ! it was easy to apply , and the color change was relatively quick this would be good for someone who is more medium complected than i am , because the color for me at least was just too dark and good for me , but bad for someone looking for a longevity , the tan did n't last the five days claimed i was pretty much back to my normal uber fair skin by the third day great product for a dark tan , particularly if you do n't care if it lasts
5	exc purchase
3	so , this seems really expensive for the benefits \? i 've been using it for a few weeks now and i know its an anti aging boost but i'm not noticing anything different at all it does say for best results use with their moisturizer or cream but i do not have that kind of money i use my regular moisturizer from shiseido for me i'm not sure if this is a necessary step in my cleansing regime it smells good , it 's light , and it absorbs really well without a greasy feeling but i'm just not sold i know i sound , and i realize i probably would n't see results or any sort of magic and that the benefits are just using it and slowing the aging process \? for me though , i 'd prefer to just skip this step and go straight to moisturizer
4	this one is exceptionally light compact powder with a sponge applicator the super orange under tones to this would make it good for tanned skin tones for me this was a tad on the orangy side but my friend who is tanner than me could use this without it looking orange but for her the powder was too light for every day use for her does not conceal that well would be a good finishing powder though has a mirror too
5	i really like the light and natural feel and color of this blush prior to this i was using a powder blush from another mineral cosmetics company that blush , however , felt cakey and the color went on my skin very strong this blush has a much lighter feel and adds color easily without looking like i am painting my face i am very pleased and given my other positive experience with another of their products , i will definitely buy from this company again
5	i have previously used urban decay as my go to blush , but i actually like this one better the pigment is n't as harsh on my fair skin the powder is more delicate and gives a much more natural look it seems to last all day and makes me look naturally pretty the powder is pressed nicely in the durable compact i use a regular blush brush to apply this the powder smells nice , which i noticed as soon as i opened the compact overall a great blush , that i will plan to stock in the future !
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great under eye concealer ! use daily when first apply in the am no retouch needed
5	i like the worry free convenience of gel polish i had been using gelish but stopped because the removal process made my nails too thin after a gel polish , i asked my manicurist to give it another try she recommended the shellac brand because it is easier to remove true ! to save the high price of having her do it , i order this , the top coat and a color to do at home i have a uv lamp but purchased an inexpensive led lamp that i found at sally i am very pleased with the results
5	omg , received so many wonderful samples in this box loved trying things i had never used before then the thing when i order so vichy night mask , they took the cost of this box off the product the product i order was not even in the box however it vichy is considered a luxury item try it there was even some men cologne samples , my grandson loved
3	it does the job , and covers well however , it tends to come off on your pillowcases it does n't stain , but it is annoying
5	i got to try this bio ionic long barrel styler curling iron totally gave my hair a smooth appearance like a top quality iron should and curl stayed all day on my silky limp hair as my picture shows you really should n't do like me and wrap the cord around it tho , a bad habit
4	it has a tiny bit of sparkle which i would normally not like at all , but this is very light sparkle , can barely see it love the color
5	love the color very summerish it 's a great polish and the price was great less money than i have seen it at any store the quality is great too they use it at all the nail salons
5	i would give this more stars if i could this is the best skin care product i have ever used a little goes a long way and if you use too much , it will sit on your face forever however , you can see the vit e oil in the cream i also use it as a cuticle cream and at night before i go to bed , i put some on my hands and they feel so soft is the morning
4	leaves my face feeling so clean you do n't need a lot to make it sudsy either i usually follow with the hydrating mist toner i have light brown skin \( a black woman \)
5	after my aesthetician recomended the a c serum \( which i love so much \) , i decided to try other pca skin products the toner is great , non drying and has a great pumpkin smell i use this along with the and the a c serum i struggle with acne and using this products help me keep my pores clean and unclogged highly recommend the line
5	i really like these shellac nails i find they do not last 3 weeks , it really depends i think on what you do with your hands when i am working in the dirt , or anything that puts nails at risk they will chip as other polishes do but i have an allergy to acrylic so these are a dream come true for me to have my nails tend to be very thin and break easily , however , it is not rare that my nail polish will last near 2 weeks at a time if i take it easy on the hands love the color , you use this as a base for a french manicure and it works well very natural color
4	i really like this foundation ! i have n't tried cream foundation before , and i found it easier to blend than a regular liquid foundation i found it slightly darker than my skin tone , but i like it and will keep using it i like that once apply it , it does n't feel crusty or sticky it comes with a little spatula to get a chunk out , but i prefer to use my fingers so i can put it on lightly i use this over my blemishes , you can hardly see them after applying for the 1 oz , a little goes a long way !
4	from my daughter works nicely to smooth skin and make pores smaller before applying makeup it is lightly scented and did n't irritate my skin goes on smoothly and feels nice on skin
3	this is good , not great the amount of shadow in each pan is rather small packaging is as expected it 's just ok in terms of pigment i like this but would n't consider it a great value for the price that is why i'm not giving it 5 stars if you 're a make up junkie , it 's nice to have , but for the price i 'd go with another brand
1	essie nail polish usually impresses me , but this polish does not last more than a couple days i would be very surprised if it was real essie
3	according to the box , this h2o plus illuminating night cream \( 1 7 ounce \) is clinically proven to enhance skin 's radiance , clarity , evenness , complexion , brightness , and texture , all while reducing the intensity of dark spots if the company says it , it must be true and i certainly want to believe it but i ca n't help wondering how you clinically test things like clarity , radiance , and brightness of skin \? when i applied this cream to my face at bedtime , it felt fine at first , then it started to sting \( i do have sensitive skin , so a lot of products produce this effect \) the stinging subsided after 5 10 minutes however , the strong floral fragrance stuck around for hours , and made me even consider getting out of bed to wash it off \( one does hope that regular and husbands generally like this fragrance \) the next morning my face looked about the same as always , but i'm sure you need to use the cream regularly to see any beneficial results also , the box says , for optimal results use with illuminating serum the serum is also available on amazon \( about 50 for 1 ounce \) the night cream 's dispensing jar is nice , though it 's confusing if you have n't encountered one like it before you remove the flip off top , then push down on the screw off top until cream comes up through the center hole one push dispenses enough for a single application , so you do n't waste this expensive cream \( about 54 for 1 7 ounce on amazon \) if you can afford this h2o plus line of skin care products , then i say go for it because this night cream appears to be an effective skin moisturizer , i rate it at 3 stars \( it 's okay on the official amazon scale \)
5	this is the best self tanner i 've every used ! it goes on with a brown green color but then you wash it off in 1 3 hours and do n't have to worry about it staining anything after that the color develops a nice golden brown , not at all orange and with minimal streaking a tanning mitt is a must have for application
4	delicacy is closer to a light peach or pink peach shade with a very muted shimmer very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point
5	this concealer is easy to use it goes on smooth , provides good coverage , and looks natural i use it on age spots and wrinkles it blends in and looks nice this is a good product in some ways the cream concealer stick is more convenient than the liquid concealer it never spills , there is no brush to get gunky , it comes in a small container you can carry in your purse , and it lasts a long time the case is sophisticated looking and it makes you feel elegant
2	i have been buying these for 3 yrs and i'm so disappointed with the 2 packages i bought this yr i ca n't even tell that i'm using them when i first started using them i tanned instantly then i continued to buy them , but for some reason they are not working at all i hope they are n't because then i feel i got i will probably not buy them anymore do n't want to waste my money
5	so pretty
3	i 've used this a couple of times now , and although i like the scent , and it helps with dryness , the shimmer is definitely hit or miss if you do n't use body lotion prior to applying this product , you wo n't see any shimmer if you attempt to rub it over your skin so the application is more even , you wo n't see any shimmer just spraying \( get it far enough away in hopes of covering as much as possible , good luck \) and letting it air dry will usually result in some shimmer this is the pearl version seems like a lot to spend for as much as it takes to make it appear evenly applied
2	i have had the occasion to use several vincent longo products and i realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price in most situations i have found you get a really good product for your investment however , in this case , i am just not sure about this one size vincent longo water canvas base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page , but in reality , when you get it , the small size is rather shocking there is only 88 oz of product in the tube , which if you translate it , you can imagine three tubes of jack black lip balm and that is about the size of this product texture i have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there i have to say after testing this repeatedly , i just do n't see any advantage of using this primer the feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes when i do this , i feel a lot of silicone feel to it this leaves my face feeling like it has wrap on it of sorts it is hard to explain , but after a while of wearing this primer , i feel like my face wants to breathe and i want to remove it affect on makeup this primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely it seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin i also find when using this , that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do i still did not enjoy wearing it over time , however , so i am not sure it served that great of a purpose final comments for the price , i just do n't see how this product is worth the money i have normal to dry skin and i did n't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base i get much nicer results when using swanson vitamins hyaluronic acid serum which is very similar to lorac which was discontinued i just do n't like this primer and did n't feel it is worth the investment you get so little product for a very high price using it under vincent longo water canvas foundation does make it look very nice , however , if you have the money to invest and want to use them together there are other options that are more cost effective , however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use
3	3 5 stars ahava offers a wide variety of skin care products , however , this is the first i have used personally like of others , men and women alike , i have been seeking that fountain of youth in a bottle \( or tube , or for that matter \) so , when i read the description i was eager to put my regiment on temporary hold and try this the ups delivery man had barely sat the box down when i started opening it thank goodness it was easy to open no unnecessary this or that to my progress being aware of the product cost , i was surprised it comes in a plastic container , designed to look glass it is attractive , easy to read and easy to open touching a single finger to the cream , and rubbing it between my index and thumb , a chemical like scent is noticeable , it feels thicker than lotion , is milky , a bit greasy at first after several swirls the cream itself had been absorbed , but there was a residue that was still tacky to the touch when i applied it to my face i went through my cleansing routine , to ensure i began with a clean palate to test this product i applied in small sections , because of the tackiness left on my fingers earlier it does n't take much of this gel , a little goes a long way that is a big plus when factoring cost once applied to my face the scent became more of a factor than i had first thought there are many factors with these kinds of products that are a matter of personal preference , no right or wrong , they simply bother some , and go by others \( which is why there is such a vast selection of products , to find something to suit you , because no one product will ever suit everyone \) the scent is one such issue personally , i do not like a chemical scent on my face i would prefer a gender neutral , unscented product after i applied the gel cream there was a shininess that did n't go away put that together with the sticky residue this could definitely not be used as part of my morning routine under makeup i was so excited about this product and had hoped it would be something i would continue to use unfortunately , this gel cream is just not the right product for me that said , there are a lot of ahava products available i would be willing to try something different in the future
5	best brow makeup ever !
5	so rich , so healing ! ! my only wish would be a larger size !
5	love it came fast to will buy more
5	first of all the smell on this is amazing ! but it does n't stick , so do n't worry if you do n't like your hair smelling like vanilla ice cream it wo n't last i use this spray straight out of the shower every morning whether i'm blowdrying , air drying , or my hair , this is the start of my day i flatiron a lot , and my stylist ca n't believe that i do n't have split ends or damage i owe the great condition of my hair to leave in conditioner , and their serum these two products always go into my hair for or heat styling i have thick , coarse , fuzzy , frizzy , hair that needs a lot to make it look great these products are always what i start with my stylist recommended , when i wanted to grow my hair , that i heat dry as little as possible as many nights a week as i can , i just go to bed with wet hair from the shower and have the milk shake conditioning spray on it in the morning i can put on some serum and use the flatiron as if i had spent all morning burning it with the hot hair dryer ! i also like to just spray on the conditioner out of the shower on days i'm staying home , and it dries naturally with soft , bouncy , shiny curls i could n't be without this product ! i hope they never stop making it ! there are a thousand leave in conditioner products \( especially at the drugstore \) i have tried what must be every stinking one of them ! ! ! ! ! ! ! none of them are as good as this ! ! ! ! this makes feel like you are just spraying chemicals on your hair
3	this lotion smells great almost good enough to eat ! but while it may be one of the best selling lotions i have come across , i have to say that it feels more greasy than a lot of lotions when i first put it on it eventually dries into the skin and loses its , but initially it is quite greasy going on as for its effectiveness in relieving dry skin , i 'd give it a four out of five i have been putting it on my hands and feet right before bed and i can see that it is doing the job pretty well when i look at my hands and feet in the morning the single biggest factor contributing to my three star rating is the high price tag for such a small tube of lotion , 20 seems pretty excessive i do n't see anything about it that justifies such a high price , so it 's hard for me to give it a strong recommendation , even if it does work there are plenty of other lotions on the market that do the job just as well but come in larger bottles and with smaller price
3	i love the color of too taboo but unlike most of the essie nail polish colors i have tried so far this color started to chip rather quickly i put on two coats as it does streak a little when applying the first coat , and also essie 's top coat within 2 days i noticed one nail was starting to chip and in 3 days another one i can usually wear most essie nail polish colors for at least 7 to 9 days with a base and top coat and i put my hands through a lot the color pictured is not as pink it is a deeper pinkish color , not quite a plum though i would wear it for a special occasion but not for the week it is fun but not one of my favorites because it chips so easily
5	works fantastic and feels great !
5	i am a big fan of ji products and have used everything from her full coverage foundation to powder foundation i like to use this as a touch up during the day or maybe before i leave work if i'm meeting up with friends i can use a little , or more , if i'm having one of those i feel and look tired days
4	good wearability
5	it is worthy of buying
5	nice
3	im not in love with this , it 's non greasy texture is nice have used under mineral and liquid makeup it 's nice , smells like ca n't really say it smooths out your skintone a little goes a long way
5	the golden vincent longo cr egrave me gel liner goes on so smooth with a stiffer eye liner brush i think it looks best with a pearly , shimmer eye shadow in white , camel , or pink it also works with light shades of shimmery purple , green , or blue perfect for parties or a night on the town ! using as a touch of highlight on your regular eye shadow can really make your eyes pop ! it takes a little practice to get the hang of using a gel liner if you 've never used one before applying to go out but it is well worth the time for the fabulous look you ca n't get with any other form of eyeliner
5	great lather and refreshing leaves my face all tingly !
2	the elta sunscreen products were recommended by my dermatologist i chose this tinted one because i was hoping for a tiny bit of coverage to help even out my skin tone instead it went on practically clear and very shiny i also wanted some sunscreen protection for the delicate eye area i could not use this anywhere near my eyes because it burned like crazy and i had to wash it off after about 10 minutes i tired it a second time and the same thing happened also i was disappointed when i read in the instructions that for it to be effective for sunscreen protection you need to reapply it every two hours it was not that expensive , but it was a waste of money for me
5	great polish !
5	i love this face cream i 've been using it every day for a few weeks two pumps is enough to do face and neck it glides on smoothly and readily absorbs into the skin i love it because it does n't feel like a lotion sitting on your skin or feel greasy i'm not sure how long it will last since it seems you use so little of it , but it 's the best serum i 've found so far and would likely reorder despite the price i have n't noticed any difference in fine lines , but as another reviewer noted , if you read up on this serum you have to use it for a few months living in a hot humid climate , i really appreciate how readily this absorbs into the skin
5	i am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked ! every product i 've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective with a great price ! i 've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out i'm a very happy customer this product is wonderful for my sometimes dry skin
5	i loved this makeup i'm only using it on my face but adds great color and is very attractive wow !
4	this concealer \( for me \) was a once a day application for , angry zits on my face it blends easily with my skin tone and while i do n't use it often \( i'm male \) , it does cover skin blemishes very well as needed
3	i was looking for a rich royal blue nail polish had seen swatches of essie 's bouncer it 's me on the interwebs and thought this was the one ! first coat was thin and very watery not at all what i expected second coat still watery and sheer i'm a fan of l'oreal 's miss candy nail polishes they 're sheer and gel looking i thought this would be something like that , but it dries matte ish a coating of seche vite improved it and gave it plenty of shine , but was still quite sheer if you want a more opaque look , you 'll definitely need at least 3 4 coats
3	seems to work alright , though this is a long term kind of product so just a few treatments wo n't reveal much effects i did not really like the smell of the fragrance so long term use is n't really too attractive to me this is very subjective though , as some might be okay with the fragrance
3	it 's ok
4	my girl is blonde i am white haired , we are both using this , she feels her hair is looking as blonde as ever , it looks good to me , but i really ca n't tell , but its her head lol i like how my hair feels with the use of this , being my hair is white i 've not noticed any blonde \) but , i have noticed my hair has not tried to yellow like a lot of white hair will do i might buy this for just my girl to use , but i wo n't continue with it , as it really was not made for white hair shes very happy with it
5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
4	i had heard good things about obagi but have not been that impressed for this price , it was fine the moisturizer is not greasy but i will not continue with this product
2	too greasy i 've exchanged for asian sunscreens which are the best on the market
5	love it
5	good
5	i love this product i am 65 years old and getting that dry skin on the face this product has been a dream come true i now keep it on my nightstand and just before going to bed i put a few drops on my hands and smooth it over my face , neck and forehead it is quickly absorbed and then i am off to sleep knowing i am keeping my skin moist and soft highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dryness you 'll be glad you tried it out
5	i drooled over this color when it arrived ! i bought it as favors for a bachelorette party and so did not want to give it away ! it has a really pretty subtle shimmer
5	use after retin a at night great product
5	it looks like water it feels like water but it acts like super water this large bottle of micellar water comes with a convenient pump essentially soft water with micelles , little grime grabbing molecules of oil , this makes for an effective , mild no rinse cleaner it is great for easily irritated skin just pump some on a cotton ball or pad and apply to the face it removes make up , dirt and oil leaving skin soft and soothed this formulation has a light fresh fragrance on work days when i wear a full face of makeup , i use this as an initial makeup remover , followed by my usual cleanser i then swipe again instead of using a harsh toner while it will remove light makeup , heavy foundations and waterproof mascaras have proven problematic it gets some but not all so regular cleaning is required but for no or lighter make up days it is terrific it also is surprisingly effective at softening false eyelash adhesive , making removal easy and safe for you and the lashes it is nice to have on hand if you travel or frequent the gym i actually have been using some to clean make up brushes and it works well for that purpose too this is a convenient solution for active women i found it pleasant and easy to use my skin is sensitive and this did not irritate it in the least gentle and effective , it is truly super water
2	i was surprised to receive red nailpolish this picture is deceiving i was expecting a pink color it shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate
4	it works brilliant , even on the lines between the eyebrows the eyes look tighter , and younger i saw results on the first use in the morning , put it on first thing it needs time to dry and work its magic tightening the skin before you can apply eye shadow put shadow on before it 's dry and you 'll get a clumpy mess let it dry and it becomes a good base to make shadow stay on all day i did n't expect this benefit , but i like it it says to use it twice a day , but when i put it on in the evening , i wake to find it 's gotten all crusty it 's not horrible , but i get crusty bits in my eye , which while harmless are annoying i'm it one star for that i'm using one pump on the entire area , so i'm sure it 's not that i'm using too much overall , i like it
5	i really like this dryer it dries my hair super fast when i use the highest heat setting and because of the ions , i get absolutely zero frizz i dry my hair most of the way on high and then use the medium setting to finish usually , my hair is wet and this dryer gets it dry in no time at all it 's also pretty quiet , which is a great feature it 's also very lightweight , which is a very good thing too my last dryer was quite heavy and it was always a pain to use because of that this is my first babyliss dryer and i have to say that it appears to be a very good quality hair tool it 's gotten great reviews so i put it on my wish list and got it for christmas it 's a huge improvement over my old cheap conair dryer i do n't use a dryer very often instead i almost always let my hair air dry overnight however , sometimes it 's not completely dry in the morning so i need to hit it with the dryer for a few minutes i also use a round brush to style my bangs and the high heat of this dryer , coupled with the cool shot , gives my bangs the perfect amount of lasting volume i can also say that the ionic feature makes a huge difference regarding frizz even if i use this dryer on the highest setting and the highest speed , i get absolutely zero i'm too to use a dryer and round brush for a traditional blowout but this dryer works really well for my purposes the medium setting is perfect most of the time but it 's nice to have a high hot setting for days when i'm really in a massive hurry i know that babyliss products are supposed to be really good quality tools so i'm looking forward to having this dryer for years to come my stylist uses this model and she 's had hers for several years so i should expect it to last for , lol ! amazon has the best price , especially this seller , which is about 30 less than other sites this dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle , which seems to fit well but i will have to purchase a diffuser attachment separately \( i'm sure babyliss makes one \) but this is no big deal i'm thrilled that i got this dryer as a christmas present and will look forward to having some really good hair days in the future
5	i love this color it 's definitely my new favorite color i 've been wearing it even in the summer ! could n't wait til colder weather to try it out it 's dark and dreamy with a good gleam of shimmer very pretty
5	vinylux is a great companion product to cnd 's shellac system , especially since many of shellac 's colors are in the vinylux line purple purple is my favorite color for pedicures , but since the shellac removal procedure is a major pain for toenails , i especially wanted vinylux for toes toenails grow more slowly , so the grow out line takes longer to appear we all know a pedicure lasts way longer than a mani because toenails do n't get the use and wear that fingernails do , so vinylux is perfect , as it goes on easily and removes faster than shellac some have said that vinylux loses some shine over time , but i have not seen that effect at all my current pedicure is almost a month old and there are zero chips
5	i was very pleasantly surprised by this powder foundation i was afraid that it would look artificial , clog my pores , and cause breakouts , but it does n't it goes on easily with my large brush and blends wonderfully , covering as much as i want it 's a nice , matte finish that lasts as long as i want it to and it removes quite easily when i'm ready the powder is durable too , even though it easily with a light rub of my brush i accidentally dropped it on our tile floor and it suffered no cracking or damage it 's a bit pricey , but not terribly so , and i feel that the quality is worth it i 've been using it for about a month now
5	smells great and goes on smooth
4	dermablend foundation in cocoa color it is better suited for olive and darker complexions it may be too dark for pale skin foundation comes in nice packaging and the container is black i like the consistency of the powder it is not filmy and gives skin natural look it is easy to apply and i use a round foundation applicator to apply it on my skin it hides skin imperfections and gives a nice make up foundation one can add blush to it or continue with contouring the face foundation did not cause me any irritations i have combination oily skin and this foundation held its own all day long without the need to reapply
5	works great with my naturally reddish brown hair
5	i purchased the tea tree paul mitchell shampoo a while ago and love it but like to switch it up every few shampoos so decided to give this a try i am very impressed and maybe even more in love the lavender mint smell is amazing and wonderfully soothing just a small amount works itself into a creamy lather and it washes out easily the pump bottle works well too hope these paul mitchell shampoos are never discontinued
3	first of all , i like the fact that this product is organic having said that , when i used it , i felt that the texture of this eye cream seemed a little on the thin side and i just did n't feel that it left my skin feeling that soft also , i'm not a big fan of the green apple scent , although someone else might like it , as i would prefer something with a more subtle scent or no scent at all overall , it 's not a bad product but i'm not sure if it 's worth the price
2	i was unable to get the bottle to spray tired tired cannot put on hair any other way
5	great purchase !
5	jack black true volume thickening shampoo lathers very well and you only need about a quarter size amount to shampoo your hair unless you have really long hair then you 'll need to use a little more it is a smooth shampoo much like what the salons use it leaves your hair and scalp so clean i have used it several times now and the flakiness is getting less and less this true volume thickening shampoo with expansion technology puts and wheat protein in your hair shaft to thicken each strand of hair it also has basil and lupine in it to keep your hair healthy it is organic and has no fragrance it is for all hair types and even for color treated hair i really like this shampoo because it has helped to keep my head from itching so much as well as cut down on the flakiness my husband really likes this shampoo too i am ordering the conditioner to go with it i highly recommend the jack black shampoo !
5	this is my first dermablend product and i am pleased with the results reading the reviews for other products from this company , i was afraid that this quick fix concealer would feel heavy and be difficult to wash off that was not the case the concealer glides on smoothly and stays in place for most of the day it washed off with the rest of my make up trouble free i used the ivory color which blended in perfectly underneath my eyes for a quick fix i also blended in a small amount on a particularly nasty varicose vein on my leg and it did appear to mute the colors i do not know if this is one of the specific uses of this particular product but i gave it a try i would recommend this product
5	, how i do love this blending brush ! it is smooth , soft , and wide the handle is comfortable without being unwieldy i have washed the tip ends of the brush taking care not to get the base of the fibers wet and have experienced no fall out so far i am not a super high end brush buyer i do n't own any shu uemura and others that get such excellent reviews , so i ca n't compare but i do own sets of , and other drugstore brands this japonesque compares very favorably to every brush i own so far i use it to smooth powder and bronzer across my cheeks and forehead it is effective with a couple of light swipes and leaves no unsightly lines i am very enthusiastic about the quality and design i checked ulta and makeup alley and other sites and found that other women are similarly impressed i do recommend it !
2	if this was n't a brand new package i would wonder if it were old it goes on chunky and clumps off the brush and in your eyelashes the color is fine , but i wo n't buy again because of the way it does n't go on smoothly
5	first off , i chose to use an aloe vera gel instead of the included gel i wanted a more natural option that i could feel good about leaving on my skin as long as i have enough aloe gel , i really do n't feel any of the micro current when i do feel it , it 's not overly uncomfortable , just noticeable the silver ball attachment is the toning think of it like exercise for your face it only works if you commit to it ! but it works ! hang in there , give it a week or so of consistent use i was disappointed at first since i did n't see an immediate difference as i had read could be possible but , after using it for 5 days , in a row , i could definitely see a difference what pleased me the most was the furrow between my brows lessened dramatically ! that alone was enough to keep me using this after over a month of consistent use my cheekbones appear higher and more defined due to the facial toning i found a video online that shows how to use it on other parts of the body i regularly do my neck and have also used this on my hands the wrinkle reducing attachment is included in this kit it should be used before the toning and must be used consistently for to expect any difference i really feel like the red light treatment has helped reduce some old scarring on my face it 's so simple to do this light treatment there 's no gel needed and a mirror is n't even necessary i do this first thing in the morning while having my coffee and reading the news the flashing red light is obnoxious but i 've gotten used to it it also suggests you wear tinted goggles if the light bugs you overall , i am so , so pleased with the results of the nuface trinity trainer and attachment at first it may seem like a time commitment but you adjust and the results are so worth it
5	my very picky about her mascara daughter stole this from me , so i have to give it 5 stars , since she kept it ! i loved the mascara while i had it , nice long , thick lashes , no clumping the price is up there , but i 've found that cheap mascara is just that , cheap so if i can find something good , i 'll pay for it a huge plus with this mascara is how incredibly easy it washes off , i did n't end up with raw , red eyes after washing , neither did my daughter and she has very sensitive skin i will definitely buy this brand in the future
5	i 'll start by saying that i'm a person who is always on the hunt for really great products this is definitely going on my list as one of the i honestly cannot believe how terrific this product is i recently had highlights put in my hair so this is why i purchased a conditioner for color treated hair i notice after the process that my hair was somewhat frizzy i hate that i used a small amount of this conditioner \( quarter size dollop \) and was able to tell at that moment how nice this product was going to be my hair immediately was manageable \( while wet \) also , the smell of this product is very nice it smells expensive and unique , not overwhelming at all after showering , i towel dried my hair and used my normal styling product while blow drying , my hair was much more manageable and the styling was much easier the , my hair did not look frizzy at all success ! i would highly recommend this conditioner it 's very expensive , but you can see i used a very small amount and i have thin hair that 's down to my bra strap but a lot of it
5	mario badesco 's drying lotion is a remarkable product that not only works on overnight healing of skin eruptions but also is an excellent production for immediate relief of the thing of bug bites it seems like this small bottle lasts forever also
5	i keep looking for new moisturizers since they keep discontinuing them i was hesitant on using this one as it does n't look like much but a surprise i use just a little dot of the lotion and just in my forehead \( which tends to be \) when i got home from work , i checked my forehead and it still felt smooth and not dry the next day i used it for my entire face and it worked great my face feels moisturized and not tight at all it has a slight aroma that dissipated within a few minutes so it passes the smell test i would recommend this product if you want a nice feel for you skin but as for price it is too much for such a little quantity
5	i ordered the more the merrier and i really enjoy the color essie quality is great about 99 of the time , so you ca n't really go wrong stays on well , for about a week they sent me the wrong color at first , but when i emailed them about it , they quickly fixed the mix up !
5	when you spend this much for a beauty item , you want to make sure that a cheaper alternative would not work as well so before i used the nuface i spent a few days stepping up my beauty routine i , exfoliated , biore d , derma rolled , and moisturized my face to get it looking its best then i asked my husband and my daughter to take a good look at my face under bright lights before and after note the nuface facial trainer is not meant to reduce wrinkles so much as it is meant to brighten , tighten , and fill out the face for an overall more youthful appearance though many people have noted a reduction in wrinkles , that is more what the led attachment \( not included \) is for if you have seen med spa for a lunchtime face lift , they are talking about microcurrent facials the nuface is easy to use you just put a thin coat of the gel on your face , power it up , set it to your desired strength 1 5 , and you are off my skin is not sensitive i started out on 3 but bumped it up to a 5 almost immediately when i did it near my jawline i had a slight metallic taste in my mouth , and sometimes i could feel the electricity but it was n't even strong enough to be called a mild shock it felt like a gentle , rapid tapping and was by no means unpleasant or painful in the slightest most of the time i did n't feel anything at all but the smooth metal balls gliding over my skin it is easy to get the timing right but no big deal if you do n't for problem areas you can even hold it on one spot on your face for awhile without moving it i did half my face then asked my daughter to compare she quickly guessed which side i had done , stating that my skin looked better i personally noticed a bit of a brow lift when my husband came home that evening i asked him to take another look at my face and he said he could tell a difference as well i also took before and after pictures , and can tell a difference i have used it for three days now it is really easy to work into my routine i just wash my face in the morning , do the nuface for about 5 minutes , wipe the gel off , and go on about my day i decided to do some research on microcurrent as a beauty treatment , and found that it has been around for many years and popular with the hollywood set the level of electricity mimics what is present in the human body anyway , though that decreases with age , so it is completely safe for most of us people with should not use it , people with thyroid issues should avoid the thyroid area , and everyone should avoid using it on the chest area to avoid getting your heart out of rhythm microcurrent started out as a medical treatment as a pain therapy and also to help people suffering from or stroke to lift their drooping facial muscles back in place it stimulates your body to produce more collagen and more amino acids , both which lead to a more youthful and lifted appearance if you read unbiased reviews such as by users on youtube , etc , you will see that pretty much everyone loves it the nuface is not as strong as the lunchtime face lift microcurrent treatments advertised by med spas , but that just means it takes longer to see the full effect , not that they are less effective and five minutes at home each morning is easier , less time consuming and less expensive than med spa treatments twice a week for six weeks , which is the recommended start up treatment , with less frequent follow up treatments thereafter nuface does not interfere with facial injections such as botox or , though you should not use any microcurrent treatment for about two weeks after having the injections after that it is business as usual , and there is some evidence that microcurrent actually makes the last longer and helps to reduce the amount needed yes , the nuface is expensive and is not for everyone however , if you have been tempted by the lunchtime face lifts or regularly get med spa treatments , or are just really not pleased with the signs of aging on your face and are willing and able to invest that kind of money , nuface is an excellent way to bring back some of the youthful skin tone , fullness and tightness it is a hefty initial investment , but check out the unbiased reviews for yourself , do your own research , and figure you can spend that cash now for a piece of equipment you can use quickly and easily in your own home for years , or you can get a handful of spa treatments that will last at the most a few months
5	smooth skin
5	this product is the best i recommend it !
4	this eye cream is heavier bodied than i typically use , so i have to rub it in rather than pat or slide it on there 's a slight tingle on application that goes away very quickly it has made the circles under my eyes a bit lighter even though it 's a thicker cream , the nozzle opening on the tube is tiny , so you can control how much you want to use and do n't accidentally squirt out too much , thus preventing waste
2	i have oily , acne prone skin and found this product to sort of leave a film on my face it did nothing to clear my skin , but it might be good for someone who wants a bit of exfoliation and has sensitive skin
5	great product
5	i use a shaving brush \( a 100 brush from art of shaving \) this is a must to get good lather i like the jack black over the , which came in 2nd , and art of shaving cream , which went to 3rd in my book the jack black cream whips up nice , and you only need a little , i mean like the size of a nickle to get a nice foam to shave with i have a sensitive face , i use pacific pre oil , then use this , and i get a nice smooth shave i have also switched to old fashioned razor , \( not straight edge \) double edge i get a great shave , the blades are dirt cheap , and one means less abuse to the face ! !
5	love this product
5	love this eyeliner very smooth application and easy to smudge stays put , though i do n't know if it is waterproof i like it , i like how easily it glides on and comes right off with makeup wipes highly recommended lasts all day for me
4	love this color as another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery i used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color it looks great just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color
4	a friend and i saw this polish on pinterest but could n't find it anywhere we were so happy to see it on amazon it is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year , as well as any occasion you can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event !
4	loving this stuff so far ! it 's about the only thing that helps with the itchy skin and i have super sensitive skin and it has n't been a problem liking it so much that i want their products for the baby too !
5	got this for my picky , picky wife amazingly , she loves it and me with a kiss nice glow me too
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	so far i really like this cream , it 's very light \( does n't feel occlusive \) and penetrates well , both are points that are important to me the fragrance is also light and dissipates fairly quickly on my hands \( which are very dry compared with the rest of my body \) i need a bit more moisture but i'm holding off on applying any additional product \( s \) until i use this product awhile longer to see if that 's necessary in the long run i really appreciate the lightness of this product on the chest area where i tend to perspire readily the active ingredient in nia products is niacin some reviewers have reported some side effects that i feel are related to reactions to niacin , which can be fairly common in people taking the supplement internally since it is such an ingredient , i suggest some caution for people who tend to flush or when taking niacin as a vitamin as well as people with hypersensitive skin in general try a test patch before applying generally over other areas of the body this being said , my own skin is somewhat sensitive , especially since i use retin a , various topical peeling agents , chemical peels , etc to help with acne and other problems i have with my skin i have n't had any reactions to the nia 24 product and my skin has remained calm after application i have tried niacin based serums in the past which have made my skin react negatively , so i'm pleased that this has n't been the case with this particular line of products i love the way this cream is packaged , in a vs more fancy types of packaging and there 's a generous amount of product to work with typically , it takes longer to see results on the body compared with facial products so it 's important to use this cream for a long enough period of time before judging the end results accurately this is even more important for people over 40 , the cells take a bit longer to turn over than younger skin i plan on using this product as a companion to my that i'm doing for both hyper hypo pigmentation problems from previous sun damage and hope it will work well in evening out my pigmentation issues it 's really too soon to judge the effectiveness of this cream yet , but i do plan to update this review when enough time has passed for a fair perspective however , if you are using any exfoliating products on the body \( such as alpha or beta hydroxy products \) you may see improvement sooner since those products will indeed boost the effectiveness of niacin i'm a retired paramedical and am looking at this product from a professional as well as personal point of view and can say that i would feel very comfortable recommending this product to my clients with sensitive \( or \) skin types that are seeking improvement for sun damage based upon my experience so far i will be back to comment further after a month or so has gone by since at least a 30 day time period is required to see improvement with hyperpigmentation , old cells must be replaced with new and healthier cells and a 30 day window would be the minimum please note that niacin is a melanin agent , it stops new melanin cells from forming but does not remove what 's already there this method the skin of melanin over time , so you absolutely must give this product time to do it 's work if you 're looking for an instant result , look to laser or chemical peels , they are the only approach that will give a so called result \( which appears after a down time of peeling of the skin \) it is actually the deep peeling which removes some of the surface melanin a potent sunblock over treated skin is also a must , regardless of the weather and this applies to indoor lighting if you spent hours days under fluorescent lights \( which give off low level uv \) and can also contribute to pigmentation problems realize that people who have hyperpigmentation from either injury to the skin \( scar tissue formation \) or hormonal issues may need additional help to correct these problems no topical product will be helpful for either , unfortunately , without dealing with the underlying cause injury to the skin must heal completely before topicals can do their work , and hormone must also be corrected internally for products like nia to work effectively with these caveats in mind , i feel this product has great potential to help common hyperpigmentation problems for both men and women of all ages without the skin as with acid based products
5	love the color , it 's lighter pink , just how i like it
3	i generally order my cosmetics and primer from korea the bb creams , highlighters and primers by korean companies have worked really well for my very pale and complexion japonesque radiance primer is certainly radiant it has a bright almost metallic finish the effect is fine under makeup it does give a brightening effect it is smoothing and makes a nice base for makeup the only downfall and it 's a big one is that it is also glittery the finish would be great if not for the tiny flecks of glitter it makes me look like an vampire i'm just too darn sparkly if however , you happen to be a sparkly vampire , this would suit you perfectly
2	i should have known by it 's name clearly pink it is definitely clear absolutely clear just a clear coat with the slightest , slightest , slightest hue of pink almost invisible i would n't waste my money
3	my skin gets dry again after a few minutes if you want to get more moist , you should use it very frequently i do n't know why ewg recommend it perhaps it 's because of it 's safety
5	cannot live without this is one product that i will use for the rest of my life
4	i love essie , best nail polish that goes on thick and with out streaks did n't like the color on me , so i gave it to me niece
3	i like the obagi360 hydrafactor sunscreen , but i do n't find it to be better than other brands that cost far less this lotion still has the slight scent of sunscreens and it absorbs very fast and makes your skin feel well moisturized even though it does n't feel greasy it makes my face shiny , which i do n't like the spf 30 is great and it does n't make your skin ashy looking like some in that range i think the brand kiehl 's has a comparable moisturizing sunscreen that costs less than this while giving you nearly twice as much
5	this is a pretty nice parfum it is not overpowering and as i guy and i honestly say this is one of my favorite scents it is definitely head turning it is actually pretty light yet you know when someone is wearing it created this scent knew what a guy would like it is a lightly sweet , citrus smell with vanilla undertones it lasts for a while and i personally think it gets better as the hour wears on price is a little high but if you want something good sometimes you have to pay for it good perfume is n't cheap if you are a man or a woman sometimes you have to spend a few more dollars for something nice i will definitely be spending the cash for this in the future when this bottle runs out all in all this is a really nice parfum it is well worth the money and i will have no problem getting more the future
5	this product works like a serum , but it 's a lot less it makes your skin feel super hydrated , non irritated and not greasy smells fresh and clean , and my skin just drinks it in i use it every day under my moisturizer and i feel like i 've seen a big improvement in my normally ruddy , dull textured skin also , if you care about these things \( and i do \) , badescu products are not tested on animals
4	get color but pretty watery
5	top of the line immediate results
5	this is the best combo foundation powder i have ever seen i hate the creme to powders because they do n't always play nice with combination skin i have extremely dry skin with oily patches , even in my late 50 's and they are sometimes hard to apply overall my skin is still pretty good but i have a lot of redness in my cheeks down the sides of my nose and by my mouth , which i am very self conscious of , so what i 've been looking for is something i can use for partial coverage only where i need it this has done the trick and allows me to blend out those red areas with a product which matches the rest of my facial skin tone , and i'm not stuck with a heavy or powdered looking face most of my friends were n't aware i was even wearing facial makeup !
5	this is a deep reddish purple color , really lovely , and unusual not sure what else to say , but need these extra words to post \)
5	this is the first time i 've used a lumabella hair straightener , and it works rather well , i have to admit you receive the straightener and two packets of their macadamia oil \( more like tubs \) which allow you to use the feature of the device \( you can also use distilled water or the iron without the mist feature \) it 's easy to add the oil for the most part you pop out a on the bottom and then there 's a rubber socket you have to remove \( that might take some nails or something small to pry it out \) it holds a whole tube , more or less \( i had a little oil drip out when i was adding the tube \) , and when i put it back in i did n't see any oil drip out of the iron there 's a long cord and the plates are wide enough to handle a decent section of hair they heat up in a decent amount of time , \( a minute or so \) , it 's not blinding fast but it does n't take forever there are blinking lights that to a heat amount , which you can find in the manual there is an auto turn off \( an hour \) in case you forget to turn it off , and a locking mechanism as i said , you can decide if you want to use the function , there 's a button on the top which you must hold down for two seconds if you want to turn it on , and then it wo n't emit the until you close the iron i had mine on a lower setting since i 've bleached and dyed the tips of my hair , and i did n't see too much steam but my hair was straightened and the ends did n't feel hot despite being straight , so it worked , and it did n't come across as or damaged so it works , it 's good if you 're worried about heat damage , and there 's options for the all in all , i 'll be using this in the future when it comes to straightening my hair
4	i have used this several times over last week and i really like it as a little refresher pick me up when i'm feeling tired or hot or both i honestly have n't noticed a difference appearance wise so far but it does seem to brighten me up a bit it has a light lemon lime scent and absorbs very quickly if you are a fan of bliss products i think you will really like this spray !
5	good
5	with the constant humidity in florida , this product is a life saver i make sure to keep one in my purse or car at all times it 's so refreshing ! it 's also really great to use as a setting spray because it helps all the makeup melt into the skin beautifully visit my blog at christinaschiccorner com to read my more detailed review i posted about it
5	works wonderfully as a detangler and makes my hair smell so good ! excellent product ! does n't make my hair feel sticky or greasy which so many spray on product can do
5	good
3	the color looks just as good on as it does in the bottle \( if you use a super shiny topcoat \) , but the formula is pretty awful it went on super gloopy and dried extremely fast making it hard to work with and despite my buffer , base coat , and seche vite top coat , the polish chipped the next day it reminds me of butler please gorgeous color , but do n't expect it to last more than one day on your nails
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
2	glad i ordered the smaller size to sample the smell was light and nice , but the beach spray in an aerosol just did n't work i 've tried many beach sprays and knew that oribe was a luxury brand so wanted to try it it shoots out in big of spray , which means it wo n't last long it did n't give me beach waves at all i had better luck with 5 00 beach spray
2	i am not a fan of this polish it has a relatively dull finish and take 3 4 coats to effectively coat the nail i would not recommend that other people purchase this polish
3	i have been using this applicator but the product toppik is questionable i use the applicator to spray the product around my edges to cover the gray
5	this is a very thick cream with a very light , pleasant scent it absorbs quickly into my skin and my skin feels instantly softer and smoother i 've been applying it daily on my arms , hands , legs and feet for over a week and i'm really noticing a difference i have had very dry skin that looks scaly especially on my legs and this has improved ! it is n't greasy at all so i put it on at night before bed without worrying about getting on my i'm not sure what it would do about firming but it definitely improves the appearance and feel of my skin , so i'm a happy customer !
4	i tested out a bit of this before i actually got in the shower , and was surprised at how lotion y it looked and felt i have to say that i really had my doubts as to how it would work as a body wash but with a poof \( sponge \? \) what i found was that pumping out my normal amount of body wash resulted in a lot of suds too many suds i was surprised after that first shower , i stuck with pumping the top once , and it was perfect i find the scent to be pleasing , not that i could really tell you what it was that i was smelling my skin felt softer than usual straight out of the shower i did not apply lotion at all , just to see how i felt my skin is not all flaky or anything like that i 'll probably be able to get by with only doing body lotion a time or two a week , instead of really needing it daily i love the pump that will keep me from using too much product if i choose to purchase more , it will be a bit of a splurge item , but the fact that i'm using less of it , and using less lotion too , keeps it from being a huge for a couple of hours after my shower , i could sniff at my arm and detect a light , fresh scent from the body wash my boys thought i had gone completely crazy though the things i do for a review
5	i love this shampoo ! i'm a red head so i have to be careful with what products i use so as to not strip my hair of its color i 've received numerous compliments on how well my hair smells after using oribe shampoo i also love this shampoo because my hair still feels soft even if i do n't condition it
5	great color ! i love it too bad it 's discontinued
5	beautiful this color
5	it was a little sheer at first but after 3 coats it 's a real bright peach color
5	love the color of this shellac
1	warning this product contains peanut oil not only does it not work , it could kill someone with a peanut allergy great job , mario
4	this is a good product it does help whiten your teeth is it better than the 6 whitening at the grocery store \? not really
4	it 's a little thick , but a small amount goes a long way it will keep the oils off your face for a while but do n't be surprised if you have to reapply later on perfect when you go out at night when spf is not a necessity will look at other products though to compare , but i would buy this again
5	favorite color from essie love the name to to buy or not to buy \? very nice , and whatever you can say about nail polish
5	this cleansing milk is the best i 've used for removing waterproof mascara one of the brands i use is great for thickening lashes but it goes on thick and has real staying power that 's great for all day wear , but removing it can be a real chore this product seems to dissolve it or melt it so i can wipe it off width cotton balls or a tissue it takes a couple applications but it does n't leave any traces of the mascara with other products or soap and water , my lashes would look clean , but then the next morning i would see black smudges under my eyes i do n't see that with this of course it also works well for removing foundation or lipstick and other makeup the easy stuff it has a mild scent that 's hard to describe it 's pleasant and not overwhelming it smells more like a soap or cleaner than a fragrance it does n't dry my skin i usually rinse off what i do n't wipe off with cotton or tissues , although it can be left on your face i still apply a moisturizer before bed
5	good
5	love love love this color it goes on well but you need a steady hand but the end results are great
4	my main complaint with this stuff is that it ships in a glass jar that makes it difficult to toss into my bag for traveling that said , just a little bit provides enough control without leaving my hair stiff based on its texture and consistency , i was a little afraid that it would leave my hair looking wet all day , but that is not the case , at least with the amount that i use there is a slight fragrance , but it is more pleasant than not \( a bit of citrus , i guess \) and it does not linger all in all , good stuff i might heat it up a little and pour some into a plastic tube for traveling , though
4	it 's water elegantly packaged spray on water makes my face feel good but due to the amazon vine program i did n't have to pay 12 99 for 5 2 ounces of water sure it has minerals but so does my tap water and i could even add some trace mineral concentrate to tap water and put it in a 3 00 reusable sprayer
5	favorite color from essie love the name to to buy or not to buy \? very nice , and whatever you can say about nail polish
4	i love the purple color it 's not in your face purple , but almost a little more pink and soft looking the one thing that i'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen it 's not really matte and not shiny i have n't decided how i feel about that
5	it covers gray hair perfectly
5	love this product
4	i 've used a couple of cindy crawford meaningful beauty products my favorite being the ones that contain the melon complex and melon extract i have found that nothing compares to the fabulous results i get from the night moisturizer with melon extract this meaningful beauty wrinkle smoothing capsules advanced formula , hyaluronic acid targeted treatment serum , 60 count are small and targeted to the deeper forehead and laugh lines these capsules have a twist off end , so that tiny drop goes on totally fresh i 've been using these for a few weeks and though my forehead and laugh lines are still there , the lines themselves are actually smoother and softer the results are much quicker when using the night moisturizer with melon extract than using these capsules the deeper lines on the forehead and around the mouth are very hard to get rid of , and so far , these capsules are not showing any dramatic results , but the lines do feel softer and smoother after a few weeks i'm hoping long term , the results will be better , but for now , i'm happy with the softening of the lines and i feel this is a 4 star product
5	life 's too short to mess around in the bathroom all day , but i admit i love trying out products i 've in a lot of different moisturizers , serums , and creams over the years , both things i bought , vine review items , and products in showers and bathroom \( yes , i do ask ! \) , and this one is a big winner i'm in my mid 50s with combination skin that used to be oily i 've been using this serum sparingly one squirt , which gives you just a wee bit of lotion , but it 's very thin and maybe i'm just the target audience for it , or maybe it 's wishful thinking , but there 's a new softness and radiance to my skin i still use my grocery store eye cream for the delicate eye area , and follow up with with a heavier bodied moisturizer such as nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href trader joe s nourish antioxidant facial serum two pack dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 trader joe 's nourish antioxidant facial serum two pack a , but i'm sold on this a data hook product link linked class a link normal href skin co roma truffle therapy serum 1 0 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 skin co roma truffle therapy serum , 1 0 fl oz a nbsp as the first product to go on my skin after cleansing at this rate , the bottle will last me about 3 months ai n't nothing gonna make me 35 again , but this stuff is definitely brightening up my middle aged mug
5	i think butter london is the best nail polish the colors are beautiful it goes on well , easy , and smooth , and most times 1 coat is all you need , especially the darker colors well worth the money highest recommendations
5	this mustela essentials is a good combination and nicely packaged gift set for baby shower or similar occasions the ingredients are plant base and safe for soft baby skins it has four baby bath essentials , from a fun bubble bath to after bath lotion i recommend it !
4	if i had to choose just one piece of makeup to have , it would be a concealer this does double duty to hide any breakouts and also using a little under the eyes to look more fresh and rested the applicator is super easy to use and a little goes a long way , so i expect this little bottle will last for quite a while my only complaint is that it 's just a bit darker than i expected i 'd go a shade lighter next time but overall fantastic product
5	one of the best blower , ever is so light not heavy at all ! ! it cut times in half ! love it !
5	this was my first time trying vincent longo makeup , i really like this powder it goes on smoothly , does n't cake i love the mix of colors that blends nicely comes in an attractive black compact with mirror that is easy to open it does not cause me irritation or breakouts which is great and i love that this is a cruelty free product not tested on animals way to go vincent longo !
5	we have three massive make up cases just for cosplay and , since i have been the designated make up person for the last five years i can tell you that nothing beats dermablend in fact , the entire lower tier of one of my huge train cases is just filled with their products you can buy cheaper but you 'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural you simply cannot buy better ! this foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks beauty marks and , what i really love is how once i have a clean canvas \( one perfectly created by dermablend \) , i can layer over regular make up \( or more extreme cosplay make up \) without pilling , rolling , or smudging i can even do fine line work and the lines stay sharp ! ! i cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as dermablend finally , dermablend lasts until you remove it we have used this for full days of photo shoots and panels and it just stays put ! \( it 's best to use a make up removing cloth to gently remove it and then move on to a light cleanser with a clarisonic this seems to really do the trick ! \) dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream i have never had one subject have any sort of reaction ever ! that says a lot about these products ! please , do not be put off by the price a little goes a long way for most everyone i have used dermblend for years ! it is the best , bar none !
5	a friend i worked with who was in her 40 's told me about strivectin a couple years ago and i did give it a try but do n't remember why i stopped using it i bought the eye cream and the matching face cream recently because i just turned 31 and noticed my skin looking dull and older and wrinkles starting to appear around my eyes i 've got to say , i really like both products the eye cream goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin really quickly i 've noticed a big change in the feel and look of my skin since using these products and will continue to use them no decrease in wrinkles yet but i'm really just hoping to increase the quality of my skin so i look better as i age
4	this foundation is lighter than the dermablend mousse and takes more to get full coverage it also leaves my face feeling more oily than the mousse but not enough to create a shine or make my glasses slide off the coverage is smooth with no lines or streaks the directions on the bottle are for sunscreen and not for applying makeup but the description on the amazon page gives good instruction for the novice i applied a light powder over the top and have received several comments that i look really nice today , in spite of wearing a t shirt and jeans this foundation did a pretty good job covering the blotches and red spots i have from rosacea
4	the of youth can be very expensive however , as many people know , skin creams can be a giant but , if you find something that truly works , then its worth every penny i was excited to try out the tns serum which uses growth factors to make skin look better growth factors have been in the skincare news for awhile based on their potential they can , supposedly , rejuvenate collagen and elastin \( two important things for the skin \) at the cellular level however , the research is n't conclusive , with some that the growth factors cant even get into the skin to be effective theres also been some concern about them creating favorable conditions for skin cancer however , most ingredients in skincare have a hard time getting deep into the skin a good solution to overcome this is micro needling if you do n't do this already , youll see a huge benefit if you add the practice its easy and cheap just google it \( or derma rolling \) as for the cancer claims , theres never been any hard evidence or conclusive proof and , given the overall risk factors many people have for the disease , it would be hard to one factor like this after using this cream for several weeks with micro needling , i definitely notice that my skin looks better however , i use other items \( internally and \) , so its difficult to say this made a huge difference but , it definitely helped given the high price , id research it to make sure its right for you a lot of people swear by it and , if you have the money , its a good bet to make your skin look more youthful i will also add that while its only an ounce , a little bit really , really goes a long way
5	great product !
2	just ok
4	i have tried other vichy creams and like them this cream has rhamnose in it which is supposed to be an anti aging ingredient this cream has a thick consistency but does not leave my skin greasy i have just started using it and will return to update this when the jar is empty this cream is more expensive than the creams i usually buy so i will need to see results before purchasing this so far i do like it though
5	i purchased these \( 26 \) to give as a thank you for my baby shower they have not been given yet but if it is anything like any other essie product it will be well recieved this was the best price for essie without going to some unknown website that sold imatation items i look forward to sharing these with my guests we are very excited that the pink with the sparkles will represent our daughter !
5	i have purchased several of these candles after having received one as a gift this scent was new for me and i was n't disappointed ! as always , remember to burn the candle the first time equal to the diameter for even burn
5	spray applicator only fits on regular size and economy size it will not fit the 1 94 oz bottle size excellent product that works so much better with the spray applicator
5	i really like this color
5	this product is great ! love how easily it goes on and comes off ! they really could n't make it much easier
5	love this product !
5	i like all o p i products thus far with the exception of the matte finish the original formula is the best and works on my thin brittle nails
3	sometimes it 's best to just stick with what you know i love biore strips it 's so fun to see all that gunk when you 're done i tried several asian alternatives including this product and none of them do as well as the old standby
4	i'm quite pleased with this product for my mild rosacea i apply it to my nose and other reddish areas it rubs in easily and has just a very slightly greenish hue then i put on tinted moisturizer over my whole face , and my skin looks great it really tames the redness and lasts all day i like it because it 's not too thick or greasy as well
5	amazing product for thin hair use it with and they work great together
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
3	i do not leave home without mascara and i have olive skin , so i'm always looking for a good new black mascara japonesque lash loading mascara has some very good points the black is a deep flat black i can pull it off with olive skin and i bet if you have porcelain toned skin this would look amazing it does really cover your lashes the mascara itself is a good texture the flaw for me was the brush it 's fabulous , reminds me of the brush which is my all time favorite but it is a bit too long i do have small eyes and a small face , so this might not be a problem for you , but that extra of length made for a slower application lest it become sloppy one other note this is not waterproof which is an issue for me because i workout \( and shower \) during the day so i'm using as my saturday night mascara when i have the time and wo n't be working out this is a great dark black look
5	this color is just fantastic ! ! ! it is just the right of dark blue to dress up or down love it ! ! !
5	i hate zoya as a company they have terrible customer service and their polishes are crap however , their remove is the best remover i 've ever used try it and you 'll see whips polish right off , and does n't nails and cuticles i am not sure if it works for gel lacquer polishes , though and i did n't try it on glitters
4	as a woman of a certain age , my skin needs a lot of help the skin around my eyes in particular is becoming thin and wrinkly i 've tried a few different products and none seem to really work as well as i would like them to i was beginning to think it was just too late for me , that my crepey eye skin is past repair but ! this product does seem to be having an effect on the skin around my eyes there seems to be a healthier glow from my under eye area and the skin definitely seems less fragile the only reason i am not giving this product 5 stars is the odor it should n't have one and it does and i hate smells i am giving this product a pass on the smell because it seems to be working
4	this stuff works really great , but is too expensive , imho , therefore minus one star as of this review a 3 4 oz bottles costs 42 00 i 'll definitely use up this bottle but will go back to my regular hair gel afterwards but , if you can it then by all means buy it because i was very surprised to see what it made my hair do often times , products that say they will do blah blah blah for your hair frequently do n't work like they say they will , but oribe did work like it said it would i have short hair now \( so maybe my expensive bottle will last longer \) and it rarely like i want it too always a battle i might not have used this in the correct way , but the results made me happy after i got out of the shower and dry my hair \( but still wet \) , i ran a small amount of the oribe through my hair and then blew it dry it felt stiffer , but i could still run my fingers through it and make it separate into a bunch of smaller sections that really looked nice ! i guess that 's what is meant by it was a very interesting texture that i liked a lot
3	i try and use natural products as much as possible , and so that 's what appealed to me about this hand lotion , however i was n't too impressed with the ingredient list it contains sulfates , silicones and a lot of other unpronounceable ingredients if that does n't bother you , well , i still would firmly rate this cream as very average after using nearly the whole tube , it did nothing special for my skin the fragrance is very strong and artificial smelling i definitely do n't care for it also , 10 for a small tube of hand cream seems awfully steep to me in short , the cream is n't horrible , but i would n't purchase again , and ca n't really recommend it
4	i 've loved the line ever since i found it a couple years ago at ulta great brand , although a little pricey , but good quality and will last you a long time unfortunately this shade \( 5 \) is a little too dark for me , but i shared it with a friend of mine that goes tanning a lot and it was perfect for her she has a light olive complexion and it blended very well on her skin and did n't streak next time , i 'll stick to the lighter shades as a base , it goes on creamy and you do n't have to use a whole lot to get good coverage it is smooth and has a pleasant fragrance to it , unlike a lot of cream foundations the velvety cream has staying power and covers an multitude of imperfections it comes in a sturdy bottle with a tiny little foundation scoop that makes it easy to get out neither my friend or i experienced any sort of break out or rash due to this product and after application , we totally forgot we 'd put it on if used properly , it wo n't rub off on clothes or throughout the day
4	usually , my nail polish chips in 1 day this one is long lasting , but i find that i need to shake it often \( almost between each nail \) or it gets clumpy , and then it dries with a dull finish nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat ca n't fix i'm really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4
4	i had low expectations in fact , i balked at the price point for what it is but , i stand wholly corrected this is the be all end all hot tool for me it handles my thick , yet fragile , hair with ease i rarely have any tangles while using it and it 's really up my morning routine i used to hot roll , or brush everything into a pony tail while i still love and need my hot rollers , this saves the day on days i need just a fast smoothing , or quick waves the set is long lasting , and it has n't left my hair dry or damaged i love the easy simple button operation , and that it heats up ridiculously fast seriously , this thing has changed my hair game for the better highly 100 recommend this is amazing
3	not great for oily skin
4	this is nice oil , it feels good and smells nice my only complaint is that it does n't completely absorb into the skin , and you have to wash it off your fingers , unlike lotion otherwise very nice , if a bit pricey
1	a cleanser is supposed to cleanse and this does not
4	i 've always had trouble with standard foundations finding my perfect shade of brown especially during the summer when i tan , i was really skeptical trying dermablend , but fell in love instantly with their liquid foundation like a lot of women on occasion i need a good concealer so i decided to try their quick fix this concealer is solid and will hide your imperfections even some basic tattoos when applied with the foundation it will leave your skin looking smooth and flawless you do n't need much to achieve your perfect look and really leaves your skin looking almost pore less and doll like overall for all of us brown skin girls , this is the color and cover we 've been searching for i would definitely give it a try , it 's worth the extra for the quality
4	this is an interesting device for treating wrinkles or crown 's feet around the eyes it is easy to use and the treatment only takes 2 minutes a day the device is small and lightweight it has a treatment tip that emits invisible laser radiation , an on off button , and a multi color light to indicate the device status it has a non replaceable battery and that can be fully charged within 2 hours charging is done via a standard mini usb cable and a power adapter \( both included \) there are no user replaceable parts as the device is designed to last for 3 years or more it comes with a 1 year warranty the device is designed to use around the eyes where you can feel bone beneath the skin that is , specifically , the area around the outer corner of the eye and below the eye never use it on the eye , eyelids or point the laser directly at the eye you should read the manual in its entirety before using the device for the first time the is a long list of warnings and precautions that you should know about the treatment procedure is simple and easy turn the device \( the light will lit green \) , place the laser treatment tip flat against the skin and glide it slowly in small circular motions , performing multiple passes throughout the treatment to cover the entire area the device will lit up purple and vibrates when the laser is during treatment , so you will get a feedback that it is working after 1 minute , it will turn itself off then repeat the procedure on the other eye for post treatment care , the manufacturer recommends their nourishing eye renewal cream i use my current eye cream and it seems to work just as good the laser may cause a stinging and uncomfortable sensation in the skin , as well as redness or swelling in some instances i tried it on my forearm for the first time as suggested in the manual it did sting a lot it felt like a mild burn it was uncomfortable enough to make me not want to continue for the sake of a proper review , i continued the 2 minute treatment my treated skin felt very tender and was a little red i applied an eye cream to help soothe the skin next morning , the redness was gone and i felt better the manual recommends a daily treatment plan for 8 straight weeks \( do not use it for more than 8 weeks \) i'm 2 weeks into the treatment plan now and i can see a difference in the wrinkles they are noticeably softer and less defined it does appear that the treatment would actually work the manual says the best results occur few weeks after the 8 week course i 'll have to revisit this after 8 weeks , but for now , so far so good
4	really like color but does have some glitter in it and i did not know it did but looks pretty good !
3	this is a good product but it does dry my daughter 's skin out a little more than proactive she has switched to using it every other day so alleviate some of the drying effects
5	baxter of california knows how to an elegant soap my skin felt like i 'd applied lotion after using this soap ! and the subtle scent is energizing and pleasing , without being overpowering the soap is thick and heavy , which gives it a feeling of quality i ca n't imagine going back to grocery store soap after using this !
5	wow this dermablend brand is amazing i am no make up professional , but i have to say this cream cover goes on extremely well , and it covers any spot or blemish you have on your face it does provide coverage , complete coverage i found best used with an applicator the tone matched the color extremely well , and it smoothes in nicely
5	loved this nail polish ! such a pretty purple grey color not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either i love essie colors , especially purple and will continue buying them !
4	this foundation is full coverage it goes on fairly easy and is buildable it does good job of making my skin tone look even and covering some light sunspots and redness from blemishes this is heavier than i'm use to and i could feel it on my face my skin is somewhat dry and i feel by the ended of the day it settled into creases and fine lines so i will definitely moisturize well before i apply this next time if your skin is dry and it settles into the creases and fine lines it can age you and i do n't want that overall it did a good job covering and evening out my skin so i am pleased with that but do to it being so heavy this wo n't be my everyday foundation but more of something i wear on special occasions it mostly stayed on when i rinsed it with water and removed well when i used my face cleanser
5	this is a refreshing change , a moisturizer that does n't promise to give me the skin of a child or to transform all wrinkles into and this promises deep moisturizing and i found that it delivers on that promise the moisturizer was very light and was absorbed pretty quickly without any shininess my skin has felt very soft and no issues with dry patches which i had been fighting the ingredient list contains no parabens and plenty of well known good \( glycerin , shea butter , hyaluronate \) the only con is that this was in a pump since exposure to oxygen is never good for beauty products this is a well formulated moisturizer that delivers hydration without shine or greasiness
5	does not shout look at my toes like so many of the contemporary colors this old fashioned color is not available in local stores i love it not too pink , not too red just right
5	this is the first self tanning product i used that dried very quickly and stays on for more than a day i am light skinned and the tinted mousse was a natural looking color for my skin i have used a mitt before and find it makes the most sense if you work it in circular motions , the tanner spreads evenly and no streaking i usually toss out the mitt , however , and do not reuse it unless it is washed and dried thoroughly i 've tried so many products that the price for this self tanner did not seem out of line
1	i was so excited to see essie nail polish on amazon i thought i was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple i ca n't return it so i wasted 9 on this color that i will never wear i want my money back i always rave about essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos are n't accurate i guess i have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color
5	being pale and protective of my skin , i do my best to look after it i try to have some sort of sunscreen on , either in my make up or beneath it i 've tried a lot of sunscreens for my face since they go well with make up and prevent break outs , sprays and creams , higher and lower end brands i love tizo i 've never heard of it and tried the non tinted mineral sunscreen , and love how it goes on so smooth \( there 's a powdery feel to it \) , there 's no scent , there 's no white or after effect to it , no greasiness at all it 's almost like a primer , in fact there 's no reaction for my skin , it 's great as is if i do n't wear make up and it does n't affect my make up on the days i wear it over the sunscreen it 's not cheap , but a little goes a long way i wish i 'd heard of this before i 'd bought another brand for the summer i know what i 'll be using from now on
5	works great overnight ! has somewhat of an odor , but nothing unbearable
4	i have auburn hair , and i have a suntanned face but this was too dark for me it went on well , not splotchy , and it glided on easily and was much lighter after i read that i should be tapping the brush to remove excess before applying to my face now i really want to find a color that matches my skin tone this is just a tiny bit too dark does n't come with a brush i noticed jouer brushes are really expensive but i found this one which has great reviews and much less expensive here at amazon http www amazon com gp product ref cart title 2 \? ie utf8 1 took me a few seconds to figure out how to open the compact also the case is made so that you can clip to another compact which makes a bigger compact and a bigger mirror
4	love this color as another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery i used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color it looks great just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	besttttt color ever its what i was hoping for the same as the picture
5	great product !
5	this comes in a lovely bottle that has a classic shape and classic styling the eau de toilette is not as strong as a perfume , and takes a bit more but is potent and lasting 1 2 sprays provides a great scent profile for most people an ounce will last a nice long time in normal use the scent itself lasts about 5 hours , but that can vary by person this is a woody , green , herbal fragrance that is manly and fresh without being overtly sexy in the initial spray , basil leads but quickly fades back to being an almost undetectable middle tone that says herbal really more than basil after the dry down , which does not take long , the mandarin is an invigorating top note , while lavender lies just underneath the base notes of sandalwood with just a tad of vetiver give it a woodsy , earthy fragrance and deep masculinity its probably got other notes , these are just the ones that i can distinctly detect also , note that in some people , after the dry down , the notes can vary in their lead , so it might seem more floral and sweet on some , if the lavender leads the fragrance on them for me , and the two guys in my family , the mandarin is predominant it 's a fairly simple scent composition that 's hard not to like i ca n't say whether this product at one time or another had a 3rd party that was less than , but at this time , it is authentic as best i can tell , when compared to a sample sheet that i have , and prior experiences with this product the bottle has a nice sprayer i feel like this is a good scent for all seasons
5	happy yellow ! very bright and vibrant
4	this product seems to make application of makeup evenly easier i would purchase again
5	living in colorado , we typically have dry skin year round this erno laszlo phelityl night cream has quickly become a favorite of mind i received it during the winter months and was thrilled with my skin and how hydrated it felt each morning i woke up i used it every single night as we 've entered the summer months and my skin can still be dry , i 've continued to use this cream \( a little goes a long way \) and my skin does n't feel greasy or over hydrated which then can cause skin to be oily will definitely purchase more when this finally runs out !
5	okay , so by now i 've tried a whole range of dermablend products mostly good , some meh but the cover crme is the best of the bunch and truly what i think of and what i want when i think of dermablend which is full coverage , anywhere , everywhere if you can only get one product from their line , this is the one to get if you want the product that made dermablend its name , this is the product to get of course , first you have to match your skin tone keep it mind that your skin has different shades from part to part the skin on my face is different from the skin on my leg or on my hand you have to have at least two shades , if not three so you can blend to the perfect match to whatever area you want to cover i have medium tones of southeast asian ethnicity my skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones so with that in mind , i chose yellow beige chroma 1 1 2 for my face it has that yellow undertone that looks best with my skin with the jar of product comes a little spatula do n't lose it ! scrape a little product with the spatula and put it on the back of your hand do n't put too much i made the mistake of putting too much product out the first time and had to discard half of it when i did n't use it a little truly goes a long way because this is really thick , hence the full coverage so , just scrape less than what you think you might need let the product warm on your hand for a bit and then apply on the skin area in question i use my index finger it covers my really dark acne spots and pimples if it was dark enough for my legs , i would have used it on them for a flawless look it thoroughly conceals any imperfections i apply some setting powder , let it set and then brush the excess off and then use a setting spray it lasts all day
5	i'm a big nia24 fan and especially of the skin strengthening complex i can tell immediately when i use it my skin seems to perk up and always looks better the next day the results are cumulative and this is the one product that , for me , helps me look less tired and evens out my skin tone
5	love the scent this has will definitely order again
5	this nailpolish has a little shimmer to it i love this nailpolish i 've worn it several times since i 've purchased it
5	this is the curling iron that you wanted as a teenager when you bought your first one from target and spent hours cursing it because it would n't hold a curl at all this iron is the preferred iron of stylists for a reason it is a workhorse , and it is fabulous i have this iron in three sizes i have the 1 , the 1 25 and the 2 this size is by far my most used size i have mid back length hair and it 's medium thickness it is wavy by nature but i typically curl it after blow drying it straight this iron has been my go to after years of use , and it still looks as good as the day i bought it 8 years ago it 's in pristine condition and it works like a charm , and it gets used there are adjustable settings for the temperature on here it 's a dial set it once and then leave it alone not like electronic ones where you have to reset it every time you use it i do wish this had an auto off feature , that 's my one thing i want that newer irons have the barrel on here is the perfect size for most hair types it gives the loose barrel curl type , the victoria 's secret curl a lot of girls are after the longer you hold the curl , the better longevity you will get i have experimented with this thing for years and gotten tons of variety with it there is a longer barrel version of this floating out there now for women with really long hair , and i feel like while that might be useful , it might be harder to as well this works well for me even when my hair has been exceptionally long i think that had i known to buy this on amazon back in college , i could have saved some money the clamp is really strong , and while the iron comes with a replacement spring , i have not needed to replace mine in almost a decade of with heavy usage if you are looking for a quality iron that will last a long time and wo n't leave you , this is worth it only a few bucks more than the generic cheap , and it will work like a horse and leave you looking gorgeous
5	dark silver color not transparent great for holiday look in combination with darker colors or nail
5	great moisturizer that i use in the morning and when ever i feel that it is getting too dry
4	does n't work as well as it used to , and costs more than it used to
3	this fhi thermal styling brush is basically like using a warm brush it does not get hot enough to make your hair stay in the desired style the wand says it goes up to 400 degrees but it does n't get nearly that hot maybe wit ha ton of product this styling brush would work , but who wants to put that much stuff in their hair \? i do have straight hair , it 's not overly thick there is a bit of a learning curve to using it , as other reviewers have said i also had my 13 yr old , who has very thick straight her , try to use it and she had the same complaints as i do it just does n't get hot enough to curl or add even much wave to our hair at this price point , i expect better results
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	i love my clarisonic and take very good care of the brushes i remove them every time i use them and allow them to dry overnight i use my clarisonic once a week and my skin stays very soft and smooth this product does not reduce pore size , but it does keep my pores so clean that they are invisible the directions say these brushes are gentle enough to use daily but i have n't needed to use my clarisonic that often i purchased these heads to replace the one i had after just a few uses , the brush is showing some wear , it still works but i can see the bristles are slightly bent my other brushes lasted much longer
5	it is hard to give a true review after only using a product like this for a few days but here are the current results after a few days use the vichy cream is nicely packaged the jar comes in a square box to protect the jar the jar is 2 tall and 3 wide it was fully filled we have had some other brands in the past that make a large container but only fill the jar half way very nice packaging by vichy the cream goes on very smooth and appears to be moisturizing my skin nicely the cream is a very smooth filling moisturizer per the packaging this cream is for post menopausal aging the cream is for fragile , thinning skin with extreme dryness this is for normal to dry skin i will update as more time goes by at this time i am very happy with the feel and texture of this cream and i am very happy with the results so far i have had no side effects
5	this spa powered clay mask treatment is soothing and refreshing to use as you spread a thin layer all over your face and leave it on for 5 7 minutes and i even left it on for over 15 minutes at times i used it twice a week and it smoothed out my skin by sloughing off the dead cells and scrubbing my skin clean and left it feeling smooth and clean i loved the feel of my skin as it was soft and it helped reduce my pores on my nose i did use a simple gel cleanser to help remove it completely
5	i really like this ahava daytime moisturizer the smell is very pleasant now overpowering at all quite a natural smell , actually i have both normal and dry skin \( dry on my forehead \) and this cream hydrates my skin evenly it 's invisible once on , so it does n't make up that goes on after it definitely makes my skin feel smoother and more hydrated i 've had very good luck with ahava products , and this one does not disappoint i highly recommend
5	really love how bright the color is already have the whole neon collection but wanted a 2nd of this shade
5	nice fuschia pink color , good for summer
4	the idea of a primer underneath foundation is new to me , but i see the appeal it does create a bit smoother texture to the skin before applying anything else and does make it seem more youthful and moisturized it 's unfortunate , however , that it does n't have sunscreen this way you have to apply sunscreen , then primer , then foundation on top of that \( hopefully the sunscreen is still in place at the end \) it 's expensive for a 1 oz tube and is doing something i thought foundation was supposed to do however , it does help the skin , and has some decent , so all in all it 's a good , if not perfect , product
5	the mustela gift set comes in an attractive box , each item is carefully sealed so the liquids ca n't spill while in shipment the bubble bath and the 2 in 1 cleansing gel \( shampoo and body soap \) has a lovely , lilac scent my favorite item in the set is the micellar water which works as a mild no rinse cleanser that can be used on the face as well as the body the items all work well with sensitive skin without stripping it of hydration
2	does n't look right when i apply it
4	i have two other sunscreens with zinc oxide a daily protection sunscreen made by eucerin with an spf of 30 and a neutrogena one made for sensitive skin with an spf of 50 of the three , my skin seems to absorb this one the best but it still left a bit of a white visible cast on my face after thoroughly rubbing in it my dermatologist wants me to stick with sunscreens that use zinc and or titanium dioxide due to concerns that sunscreens with \( a common ingredient in may sunscreens \) actually promote the growth of skin cancers even though they prevent sunburns , so i keep trying different alternatives in the hopes of finding one that goes on as smoothly as the ones i'm no longer supposed to use i would n't say that this product is ideal in that regard , and perhaps my desire is n't reasonable because i understand that the way the zinc and titanium dioxide sunblocks work is that they actually provide a physical barrier to the sun 's harmful rays maybe that whitish cast on the screen is
5	effective with minimal results
5	i have thin , gray but color blond shoulder length wavy hair not good waves , just random requiring the of styling tools i was super skeptical of the price but you definitely get what you pay for i use shampoo and conditioner daily generally mid priced \( 14 99 \) , depending on what my pharmacy has on sale this creme is shampoo conditioner in one and it 's legit ! one wash and my hair feels and smells amazing ! the scent is nice and lasts all day , my kids a little longer because my hair smelled so good ! the only draw back is i ca n't use it daily i have to wash daily due to oily hair and more than once a week and my hair seems weighed down and difficult to style so i add it to my sunday night routine
5	this cream blush is very small and easy to take in your makeup bag , it 's not bigger than lipstick just a tad thicker the application ca n't be any easier , dab some on your skin and blend , plus you can add more to make it more pronounced it 's not too pink nor red , it provides a hint of nice mauve color \( i have fair olive color skin \) it is neutral cool based so can be worn by almost anybody i applied it in the morning and touched up at lunch but i normally do that anyway
5	have to have my obagi ! have been using the obagi system for two years now wish i had started much sooner skin looks smoother , more radiant
4	love opi products small bottle but stuff what usually takes several cotton balls and lots of rubbing took about 2 and the majority of the polish came off with very little effort
5	i love love love this stuff ! smells so good feels great on my skin ! i even love as a makeup setting spray
4	this is an interesting pillowcase with infused copper ions to help rejuvenate skin appearance during sleep it is silky smooth and soft , and very well made the envelope closure keeps my pillow inside and makes it neat and tidy having used it for some times now , i have to say it is really nice and cozy to sleep in it does seem to make the wrinkles around the eye a little less prominent though i cant be sure if it is just my imagination or a placebo anyway , the biggest difference is that i no longer have creases on my face when i wake up my old cotton pillowcase was a lot rougher which , to me , probably was the cause of the creases all in all , i really like this pillowcase its silky smooth , comfortable and luxuriously looking i ca n't say for sure but it does seem to help with my skin appearance somewhat i hope the results would be more noticeable in 4 weeks per instructions so far so good
4	i like everything about this except the price , which is why i gave it four stars instead of five it has an spf of 25 it combines chemical sunscreens such as homosalate and octisalate with physical sunscreen , titanium dioxide the tube dispenses a very fine line of product so you can precisely control how much you use the product goes on very smoothly and feels very good and moisturizing on the skin coverage is pretty decent for a bb cream i put some on the back of one hand and compared with the other the hand with the product felt moisturized and softened for several hours freckles were slightly covered this cream has sparkles in it that are very apparent in the sun but not in shade you may or may not be ok with that i'm not sure whether the sparkles have something to do with the sun protection or are intended to have a light cosmetic effect the medium shade that i received is more toward the golden sand end of the spectrum than the pinky beige works well for me personally i think of myself as more fair than medium but the medium shade of this cream was fine for me the scent is noticeable but pleasant , mildly rose floral not a problem for me and i am very sensitive about fragrances i really like this quite a lot too bad it costs so much
5	amazing stuff , super hydrating i like that it 's a nice and compact size
4	the cap was broken in transit but luckily the contents did not spill this product is made in france and it shows the english directions are rather poor i just use a cotton ball to soak up some of this cleanser and rub it on my face to remove any build up there is no sticky residue or drying from toners and my face feels fresh and hydrated so , i recommend this product
5	this is my second bottle of this color perfect for summer !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	after two weeks i started seeing the fine lines around my hair line disappear so far so good
4	i like this thermal spring water spray it makes my skin feel moist after washing my skin is normally quite dry and this spray is a good way to put some moisture back without having to use a lotion that can feel heavy on my skin or clog my pores it 's a big bottle and has been lasting me a long time the water is supposed to come out in a fine mist mine sprays some fine mist , but also many bigger drops that i have to dab off my face it seems like kind of a waste and i prefer it have a fine mist all around for more even distribution of the product when i use it overall , i am happy with the results
5	this is my new favorite color it is gorgeous ! it 's a dark purplish bluish color just what i was looking for !
3	the pomade does the job it was intended for but the pomade seems to leave a slight white residue
5	love this barely very light pink love cnd shellac products lasts 2 weeks allows my natural nail to too !
5	nice color
4	i have long , fine hair i tried this as a leave in conditioner and it was ok , a bit heavy , but it dried and was fine as a conditioner , it 's good , but not better than the one i already use , and it 's much more expensive i also think the scent is a bit loud , which is typical of some shampoos and conditioners i took off one star for the combination of price and scent if i were working in a formal office or seeing clients , e g , i would not use this in the morning i 'd wash my hair the night before
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	great purchase !
5	this is a potent fragrance and a little goes a long way , which is beneficial , as you can use it very sparingly it has a distinct , warm spiciness that is very inviting with wood and vanilla scents also like burberry brit and burberry london , i would classify these as cold weather fragrances london and brit remind me of fall and winter i would say that this cologne also falls into that category great scent for a mature man
4	do n't let the tacky bottle deter you from this fragrance ! it 's a fun scent for going out on the town , but definitely not for everyday use , or even day time it 's quite sweet and really youthful the only qualms i have with this perfume are price and longevity the bottle is deceptively heavy , but it 's mostly just glass you 're paying for and the scent wears off pretty quickly
4	this is my first time using a concealer and so far i'm really impressed with it it does a fairly good job of hiding the razor burn that i got yesterday it comes in a large chapstick tube container and appears like clay to me it looks darker in the tube than it does on the skin i used my finger to dab a bit of it and rub it on my razor burn spots it takes a bit of time to get absorbed and blend in evenly that said , it does mask the redness from razor burn fairly well but not the bumps or swelling when i look close enough in the mirror , i can also see what appears to be a makeup on my face although it is very light anyway , it is not very obvious in normal social distance and completely unnoticeable at night overall , it does what it says fairly well and makes the redness from razor burn largely disappear good product
5	great product , stays the entire day and you only need a little bit to show off on your cheeks you can build the intensity love , love
5	this is a thumbs up from everyone in the family the balm is not like the cream which absorbs better but that 's like a barrier to keep the skin hydrated this is great for my wife and daughter who has slight eczema and there has been a reduction of itchiness or redness when they use this product for their dry skin
5	great alternative to gel manicures lasts longer then the regular nail polish !
5	my husband and i have been buying this candle for years each candle lasts about 6 months with roughly 4 hours burn time a week we love this brand \( and this scent \) because it fills our home with a pleasant yet subtle scent i 've tried other candles that smelled pleasant at first , but after about 30 minutes of burning began to smell overly sweet fake
5	i can not live without it ! ! ! ! is a of my everyday life and routine
4	this has the case i 've ever seen in a lipstick , so it feels special right from the start while the color is bright red in the tube , applied it has more pink and purple than i expected , but i like the tint and it feels perfect for spring flower season the color is so bright you have to apply it carefully , especially since it lasts a long time
5	good
3	ive been using this skin care product for almost three weeks , and im sorry to report that i do not see any changes in my skin so far i think it may be that it takes several months to show its benefits while i do not see improvements to date , i do not see any unpleasant side effects either i use it on a clean face and neck where it soaks in fairly quickly after it dries , i put on my normal vitamin c serum ive been using the vitamin c serum for three months , and i have found it to be effective over time my skin glows without noticeable blemishes , so it may be that id already accomplished most of what can be expected from this serum before i began using this pro niacin serum ive found that a little \( just a single drop \) is sufficient for about half my face , so i expect this bottle to last several months i did not received a full bottle for testing because the lid had not be properly screwed on at the factory , and oil was all over the interior of the packaging nia 24 treatment catalyst is fairly expensive , so , having no improvement to report so far , i do n't imagine ill purchase more of this product three stars !
2	while this product holds your hair well , it contains too much clay for my liking i literally felt like i had clay in my hair all day and when i would run my hand through my hair during the day , it would come out with a bit of clay on it such that i felt the need to then wash my hands i much prefer nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href american crew fiber 3 0 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 american crew fiber 3 0 oz a nbsp which performs nearly almost as well but does n't leave your hair all clay like it 's also cheaper on the plus side , this product comes in a nice cool glass can and smells great
4	bliss crown is a set of four beauty products attractively packaged in a box for gift giving \( theres even a paper band printed with the discounted price plus a note for buyers to remove the band before wrapping the box \) the products are lemon sage body butter , maximum moisture cream , 6 7 oz this is an excellent moisturizer , not greasy , with a light , pleasant scent , 4 oz when massaged into the skin , this is supposed to reduce fat together with regular exercise and a healthy diet this is a reasonable moisturizer but it doesnt do a thing to reduce fat , unlike exercise and a healthy diet the advertised reducing ingredient is caffeine but you can always drink triple oxygen energizing mask , quantity not stated but smaller than the 2 oz bottle next to it this is a refreshing facial mask , pleasantly scented , and does not irritate sensitive skin fabulous foaming face wash , 2 oz an effective cleanser that contains exfoliating beads these products are pricier than the drugstore and supermarket ones i normally use , but they 're not really any better however , generic drugstore brands just do n't cut it as a fancy holiday gift , which is what this set seems intended for
5	never heard of this brand and would have never tried if it was in a supermarket , but after using it , find that it is mild , just the right perfume and very calming scent to it also note that it is an eau literally meaning , yeah , not what you think what is really means that it is the mildest form of perfume
4	the obagi nu derm gentle cleanser is indeed gentle it does clean , but leaves my skin feeling a little dry that 's not a deal breaker it 's easy to use , with or without a clarisonic type appliance i 've used it with just my hands , with a manual skin brush , and with a clarisonic it works well at sudsing with all three applications there 's no fragrance , and the packaging is neat and convenient for travel i like , do n't love it
3	okay , so this stuff works , but i am not exaggerating when i say that they smell like 100 like confirmed with others too much acid probably , because this stuff is
4	i'm not sure that i love this but every nail expert i 've talked to says it is a must for a good shellac mani to last
5	i ordered the more the merrier and i really enjoy the color essie quality is great about 99 of the time , so you ca n't really go wrong stays on well , for about a week they sent me the wrong color at first , but when i emailed them about it , they quickly fixed the mix up !
5	i'm a fan of the proraso products great performance and value
5	this is so much smaller than i expected at 1oz per tube i was overwhelmed at the color choices dermablend offers i would recommend buying this in person first before buying online before using , i watch a video that shows how dermablend recommends applying it i used my hands like in the video , blended it with a brush , then set it with a powder it worked beautifully and i was so happy with how it looked once i was done what i liked most about it is how hydrated my face looks after applying it leaves a satin finish that looks much more natural compared to the mac i typically wear which leaves a matte i found the pigment to cover very well and my skin is an even tone after applying under my eyes i added an additional corrector i am a dermablend believer , and i will be switching to this once i use up all my mac i hate the feeling of lots of makeup on my face , so i tend to go lighter and therefore not look as finished this has the best of both worlds and has me loving makeup it goes on light , but gives a generous amount of coverage
3	i really like la roche posay products in general but this body cream is a little greasy it says that you can use it for face or body but it does n't absorb enough for me to use under makeup , even when i wait for 15 minutes it is good on my arms and legs but i still feel like it takes a long time to sink in
3	this vincent longo eyebrow pencil is a perfectly acceptable substitute for the department store branded one i have been using for years the blonde color is absolutely perfect for me a nice light brown that is very , very natural i like the precision tip due to the micro size however , the micro pencil is very hard to sharpen evenly ! i feel that for 20 , which is a bit more than the double sized department store pencil i usually use , vincent longo could at least include a custom sized sharpener similar to those which other manufacturers have provided as an part of eye pencil caps \( clinique , for example \) even though i like this pencil very much , and have been using it every day , i will not purchase a replacement you get less for your money with this pencil i wo n't pay for just the name it has to be better than what i have been using \( which also has an eyebrow grooming brush \) clearly , to me , it is not
5	what is not to love about this compact \? the cheek , lip and eye colors blend in to create a natural look , from plum to creams to bronze and glittery black a double brush helps apply the eye shadow , to keep skin oils off the colors the colors last for several hours before showing creasing these colors are all refillable , too impressive is also the compact case as well it 's heavy and has a nice sized mirror that is designed to handle a fall the entire elegance
4	this sponge comes packaged like it is moist but i do n't think it is wet it is the texture of the sponge like a proper sponge cake it 's kind of odd but it does do a heck of a job exfoliating you get it wet , squeeze it and just the lightest touch of a lather seems to appear briefly it makes your skin totally ready to absorb facial products my moisturizer went right on and right in like i 've never had it work so well or fast before it 's a bit smaller than i would have thought from the picture of the girl 's hand squeezing it out either that or i have serious man hands there is no noticeable smell i was kind of hoping for a jasmine green tea vibe , but i think most people these days prefer no scents there is a tiny suction cup with a j hook in the package to hang your sponge when you are done so it can dry \( or whatever it does \) in the shower i liked it a lot but it is a bit odd to get used to i am sure with using it more , i will adapt
4	i really like this shower gel ! i'm sensitive to some scents and this does n't bother me , in fact i really like the subtle refreshing scent i like how huge the bottle is which will last me a long time ! i notice after using this about 3 times that my skin felt a bit smoother
4	though the shade of the pencil was darker than i expected blonde to be , i like it , and the brush at the end of the pencil works to soften the color
4	went to get my nails done and chose this color i love it so many people have asked me about who made it i would have given it a 5 star rating but sometimes , you 'll need 3 coats instead of 2 to get the true color
4	i'm an adult with no babies however , i have sensitive skin and like these wipes to freshen up my armpits and neck on a hot day
5	my skin feels clean and smooth after just once use i tried it with both makeup and without the makeup came off with just once use , and when i tried it on makeup free skin , i could actually see the dirt that came up on the cotton ball also it did n't irritate my very sensitive skin very very happy with this product and plan to order more
4	i have very dry skin and it drives me crazy after i wash my hands if i do n't have a lotion to apply my usual choices are either nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href cetaphil moisturizing lotion dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 cetaphil moisturizing lotion a nbsp or nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vaseline intensive care healthy hand nail conditioning hand lotion dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vaseline intensive care healthy hand nail conditioning hand lotion a , and a former favorite , before it was discontinued , was avon 's rich moisture hand and nail cream i mention these to give you a basis for comparison if you like one of those , i think you would like juice beauty green apple age defy hand cream , as well i do n't usually care for apple scented products , but this one seems more citrus than apple to me i like the fragrance , and i like that it dissipates quickly i also like what they left out of this product parabens , petroleum products , phthalates , and dyes many of the other ingredients are organic , and most are naturally derived \( though not all of them \) i ca n't speak to whether it truly minimizes fine lines or diminishes hyperpigmentation i think you 'd have to use it for many weeks before any change would be noticeable i can say it contains ingredients that claim to do that , of this particular cream the cream goes on smoothly , absorbs quickly , and leaves skin feeling very smooth the one drawback i 've found is that i have to apply it twice to get the best benefit each time i use it , a few minutes later my skin feels somewhat dry again after i apply it a second time , it seems to last until the next time i wash my hands possibly i'm not applying enough to begin with , but either way , it makes the juice beauty cream a pretty expensive option for me still , i like it better than many of the high end brands i 've tried , and i enjoy using it
5	any review of a product of this type will be subjective nevertheless , the eternity line has always been a favorite the scent is not overpowering and masculine without that musk or woods scent it definitely is not long lasting by any measure and seems to evaporate very quickly it feels good on the face after shaving and is definitely soothing
5	i have acne prone , combination skin i have dark spots from previous break outs i 've tried fade creams and other lightening products to no avail so i did n't expect much from this one but i was wrong after two consecutive nights of using this product , my entire face looks more even i used it over my entire face , not just the dark spots my face looks more even and my discoloration less noticeable i remember seeing obagi products at my dermatologist 's office several years ago i believe they used to offer the obaji blue peel as therapy for discoloration and acne i trust this brand , especially now i 've seen how effective it is
3	i wanted to love this product but i do n't think it 's worth the money my dermatologist recommended it for body acne and i have n't seen a huge improvement
4	i rarely wear foundation , but when i do , i want something light that will basically blend in the slight red spots on my extremely fair skin la roche foundation does the trick for me as skin ages , it becomes more difficult to find foundation makeup that does n't make you look even older it tends to sink into fine lines and highlight them this foundation does n't do that also , it blends so well with my natural skin color that i can use it as a concealer on problem spots without having to cover my entire face with the product i 've been avoiding foundation for years because it always shows i'm so glad to have finally found something that does n't it does exactly what i need it to do and nothing more plus , it 's fragrance free and that makes it pretty perfect
4	not as shimmery as i expected it to be considering the price
5	this product is made for faces and best if worn over makeup the expiration date of my produce is august 2017 and is a reasonable date considering the size , intended usage , and list of active ingredients i am attaching pictures to help demonstrate the bottle size , type if pump , and amount distributed from one pump most of my cosmetics have spf but my current moisturizer does not i see this being highly effective on the weekends when i'm out running errands without makeup and during a time period where i would not have to reapply the product this would also be great for an outdoor event \( , wedding , cafe lunch \) where additional protection over is needed this product stung for a minute the first time i applied it but i used a purifying mask the day before and had not used any additional product on my skin my recommendation great product wear over moisturizer or lightly pat over completed makeup this is not a lotion with spf it is a sunscreen so the intent is not one of moisturization it protects the skin from sun while offering anti aging benefits offered from vitamin c
1	too dark , peels easily !
5	great !
3	my wife thinks that this an ok product but not good enough to replace the product that she has been using for years she will finish the tube and if her opinion changes by then i will update this review
3	it turns out it 's quite dark after the second coat you can hardly say what shadow is it , looks just very dark
5	love it !
5	perfect
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
3	lacoste l ! ve is a brand new fragrance for men launched in the spring of 2014 it falls under the crowded male oceanic fragrance category the top notes in this fragrance are citrus with middle oceanic notes and a dry light woody base a classic non offensive oceanic male fragrance the twist in this fragrance is that there is a subtle hint of anise licorice as the scent wears this scent is definitely worth a try for those who like oceanic fragrances and either like or are not offended by anise licorice as a new fragrance launched after the updated eu on the scent industry , this was developed strictly adhering to the new guidelines therefore this fragrance is exactly how it should be exactly how the designed it to be in terms of wear , this fragrance lasts for most of the day
5	love the color ! !
3	essie always comes out with the best colors and this was no exception the only thing i did not like about this nail polish is that you have to paint your nails white before you use this color or else it looks awful
5	not only is this oil good for removing makeup , i used it this morning as a moisturizer you have to shake it up really well because it separates so easily it has a pleasant scent and makes makeup easy to remove , including eye makeup , especially mascara
5	i used to use another brand , but the next morning all my head started to scratch , but this one is great new life , back youth \) but the price almost doubled in a day !
4	this is light weight wear every day moisturizer it goes on smooth and you can wear it alone or under makeup its light scent fades quickly and is not offensive this is a great product but there are a few down sides as well the price , 10 for only 5 oz it is actually more cost effective to by 4 of these tubes for 40 and get 2 full ounces then by the larger 1 7oz tub for 42 also it suggest using a dime size amount , so you use a lot of it quickly if using it daily and for some it might matter that it does not have an spf so you would need to use something that did
3	made me more oily throughout the day i did n't like that maybe good for dry skin
5	i bought this as a present for a friend she really likes it
5	would n't be without it ! i use it to set my mineral powder makeup and alone for refreshing moisture
5	perfect fall orange
5	i went through a major hair shed a couple of years ago , which was when i got my first toppik fibers this product has helped preserve my vanity by hiding my part and other thin spots on my head toppik blends in so nicely and stays put until your next wash i do n't use the spray nozzle attachment , i just sprinkle it on and pat it out to blend in , as they demonstrate in the video on toppik 's website i 've never seen residue on my clothing or pillowcase \( however , fine dust does fly everywhere when applying it , so get dressed after application ! \) the stuff does n't even bleed out after a tough , sweaty workout either as far as the colors , after some trial and error , i mostly use medium brown , which is more of a dark than a golden brown shade i 've also tried light brown , but that shade is more of a dark ash blonde and i had to blend the medium and light to make it work i ended up my hair a little darker so i can stick to the medium brown and keep things simple the only negative is that the fine dust settles on my white bathroom counters after application , but is easily cleaned up right now amazon has the best price on this product , costing 10 less than at beauty supply stores i 've also tried caboki , which for me was of inferior quality , lasting power and had a funny rubber like smell \( toppik has no scent whatsoever \)
4	i had mixed results with this product i followed the directions exactly because i did n't want to end up with a blotchy skin tone the mitt is very nice and does a good job helping to get this tanning mousse applied evenly however , if you happen to have dry skin patches like i do , the tanning mouse gets stuck there and will not smooth out therefore , you have dark spots everywhere you have a dry skin patch it does spread nicely on smooth skin , and the mitt does make it blend in nice and evenly if you 're really careful about not putting on too much at a time the color is nice i was hoping it would n't be orange , because who wants to look like donald trump \? it does not have an orange tint the tanning looks quite natural as long as you do light applications at a time this can stain your clothes if you 're not careful especially white clothing i would not wear white soon after application to be safe all in all , it 's probably good for younger women who do n't have skin problems if you have dry skin patches , this is n't a good idea
5	your skin feels extremely clean you do n't need to use much to have a nice thick foam i love it ! !
5	finally , a foot cream that does n't just evaporate into my feet this leaves my feeling fresh and soft all the way till morning a little pricey , but worth every penny imo
5	this works really well to cover areas needed i love it and use it often highly recommended you should try it
5	this eyeliner from laura geller new york gel eyeliner is the smoothest eyeliner i have ever used i think it is because of the gel that it goes on so smoothly even over my not so plump 56 year old eyelids was i able to smoothly and cleanly draw my eyes it was non irritating and dried very quickly i found that with a bit of practice and a sharp edged card i could draw thick or fine lines i am in love i previously used revlon color stay in charcoal , but the lines with the laura geller are so much more flawless looking i have to go draw some cat 's eyes now !
5	i have fine hair this does thicken it up
5	works fantastic and feels great !
5	i think this makes a better cologne that a perfume , but maybe that 's just me it had a subtle sophistication to it that to be discovered as you inhale the scent i suppose that 's probably part of the appeal it smells like grapes mixed with it 's something you wo n't want to stop smelling , though you probably should n't spray too much of it given the cost this is perfect for going out as your date will be drawn to the smell , but probably wo n't be able to discover that it 's you right off the bat upon discovering that you 're the source of the scent , i assume euphoria will this is a very high quality scent i like the bottle , but it 's probably not necessary when you think about how good the scent is a must buy
5	i have adult acne and very dry skin in the winter i have to really watch what i use on my face bioelements moisture positive cleanser works for me other cleanser especially in the winter , burns when i apply cleanser moisture positive cleanser does n't i 've spent so much money on facial products and i keep coming back to all bioelements products for me they are the best
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
1	i was really enjoying this until it got clogged after less than one month of use i tried multiple ways to get it cleaned out but ended up it i just shake the bottle close to my head and it works fine
3	good brand but the main thing i did n't like about this is the long or thickness of it it has an ok smell and dries nicely but 24 hours later you can still taste it around your lips gross ! get the proraso pre post shave cream and it has a better smell and gives your skin a smooth tightness and it heals nicks better shaving let me save you years of trial and error take a warm shower wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser , shave afterwards with a 50 merkur safety razor handle with good blades \( save 100 's on mach 3 refills ! \) , use a 20 tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond \( or proraso \) shaving cream \( you can let it set in a minute \) , shave with the grain down , slowly , softly \( do n't press hard let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting \) , lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry ! say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs forever ! trust me i 've tried dozens of pricey face washes , shaving creams , and after shaves over the last 4 years if you do n't want to commit so much money yet order the pre post shave proraso cream online , buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works \( under their c o bigelow label \) then get the cheap single blade disposables \( mach 3 's are too aggressive \) at a grocery store and you 'll notice a difference overnight
4	love it but do n't like the smell not like the shampoo or conditioner smells rancid
4	get color but pretty watery
5	i thought i had the very best eye brown pencil out there but have changed my mind after using the vincent longo micro pencil i really like how it goes on and how it fills in places it just glides on so easy and does n't have that waxy crayon look it looks as if you had n't used a brow pencil because it looks so natural it also does n't smear i have on my right eyebrow a area almost as big as the end of a pencil before it is sharpened and it did n't matter what i used it would n't fill in so i was very excited when the vincent longo brow pencil filled in to where it looks like the rest of my eyebrow now i will be ordering the vincent longo brand i hope it helps those of you who are looking for a really good eye brow pencil
3	i was excited to try the hampton sun face cream because i suffer from dry skin on my t zone i usually use regular lotion on my face and it just does n't seem to help i used this face cream for a little over a week and decided to try something else that was half the price so i would have a basis for comparison , as i have never used face cream before the hampton sun cream works quite well , but i did notice that i have to use more than the other product i tried since i have to use more of the cream in order to help with my dry skin , the texture of my face ends up feeling like i'm wearing a heavy amount of makeup i have never used much makeup so the texture was rather uncomfortable after switching between the two products i decided to experiment and use a thinner layer of the hampton sun and then a thin layer of the other product with the two thin layers , my face has been silky soft and i have not been plagued with dry flaky skin my recommendation is that if you have extremely dry skin , pairing a thin layer of this product with another product may be the best possible option play around with various combinations and you may end up with a dream combination i rate this product 3 stars because it works best with another product rather than as a stand alone good luck !
5	great
5	great for when you need you have excess oil
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	i love this color wore through recent holidays and it was just great many compliments thank you so very much
5	i love this condition and really works miracles on my hair it smells amazing and i love using it as a masque and conditioner very high quality
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	i stopped wearing liquid foundation years ago because , as i got older , it started to make my skin look too oily i began to break out as well , so tossed the makeup and stuck to powder the description of la roche posay toleriane teint mattifying mousse sounded like it might be a good fit for my skin , so i decided to give it a try when i first dispensed some of this makeup , it looked far darker than i expected i am very fair , a natural redhead with freckles i also made the mistake of using far too much product the time the makeup is very smooth and soft feeling it spreads across the skin and blends easily , but keep in mind you only need a small amount i 've found it goes on best with a makeup sponge once i used the correct amount , i was happy with how the makeup looked over the course of the day , i did n't feel like my skin started to look too oily , but i did touch it up with powder once unlike my past experience with foundation , my skin did not break out in the days following the use of this makeup i'm pretty happy with this product and will continue to use it
5	some characteristics this is n't a super dark black though japonesque calls it shade 01 which i assume indicates their darkest color its not overly wet which cuts back on smears and helps it brush on lightly youll find you need at least two coats but most of us do at least that many layers already best of all the relative dryness keeps it from clumping due to over application it dries quickly so theres not a lot of wait time between applications and allows you to use our eyelash curler in a more timely way so you can get out of the house in the morning i rubbed my eyes after the mascara had completely dried and there was no smearing either above or below my eyes this mascara has a minimal neutral smell washes off quickly and thoroughly the one possible negative to this product is that due to its relative dryness and depending on the look you 're trying to achieve you might need up to three coats
5	love the color and ease of application
5	love this product makes my hair softer and shiner and does n't make it look greasy !
5	this is my favorite , all time lip tint it is a stunning , sheer shade of red that literally looks wonderful on everyone it 's not sticky , waxy , and it does n't feel like vaseline some other tinted balms i 've had it smells just like fresh , wet , garden roses and your lips are actually nicer at the end of the day after you wear it i have dry skin and lips , so i usually steer clear of tinted balms since i like to layer it on several times a day , and other products tend to cake on dry spots , or my lips with color so i look like i did when i used bell products excessively in middle school with this , the color is so sheer and high quality that even if you re apply for extra moisture , it still stays natural looking and smooth you can even wear it on top of lipstick if you want to subtly play with colors this is definitely a staple product
5	i have been wearing this color on my nails for almost 3 weeks now because i love it so much ! it has a nice metallic quality to it when you see it in bright light , and has no blue tones to it like so many purples i 've tried in the past it is a very nice grape type of purple that does not look black or i have been using the shellac system at home for months now and i think it is the best polish you can buy
4	this stuff is great and definitely helps clear up zits when used as directed the earlier you detect a pimple forming and put this stuff on it , the more likely it will go away before coming to a head it seems to even help reduce popped zits \( i know i should n't , i just ca n't help it sometimes \) in terms of swelling and redness even cystic acne goes away i also use a thin layer on areas that i feel may break out \( like freshly brows \) and it is great for prevention i docked a star for the frustrating package it comes in if the bottle was a little wider and shorter it would be perfect when you get to the bottom of the bottle , you ca n't really reach it with a regular sized felt tipped swab , for one thing , and for another usually the alcohol will completely dry out before you even get to the stuff so it dries into powder \( i have gone through two bottles already \) the last of the product is wasted unless you add a little of your own alcohol to the bottle and dig a cotton swab in there , covering your fingers in the residue at the top
5	i am often turned off by overpowering scents people simply do not know how to spray appropriately there cologne or perfume so , i am always impressed when one spray will actually work unlike the name , brit rhythm has a non intrusive scent that sort of just lays around like most british , this is simply not intense it is long lasting , somewhat sweet , but immensely enjoyable again , just like a brit the smell actually is that of an adult , modern , and simply sexy i 've been a drakkar man for as long as i 've been buying cologne burberry , has won my real quick
5	love this moisturizer
3	pros i like the magnetic like lid attachment when you put the lid back on , it 's like there is a magnet to help keep the lid on which helps in my opinion nothing worse than a lid coming off in your purse and crap getting into your lipstick goes on very smooth and silky it feels nice on your lips not too heavy and not waxy color is very neutral and nice for summer i'm normally more of a or rose kind of girl but this lighter shade was a nice change for the warm months cons it is not long wearing as it claims saying this , i have never found a lipstick that really is long wearing if it 's long wearing , it 's a stain with a gloss you re apply at least , that is my experience and i 've tried lots of the years at every price point i would say i re apply several times while at work
1	the first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly wo n't let me return and i'm very disappointed i wo n't be buying polish off amazon again i usually love essie
5	have been using it for years and i like the volume it gives my hair
5	i love it
5	this concealer is very creamy and a little goes a long way for me i would say this worked well for a full coverage spot concealer it did nice on my under eyes i do not have any blemishes on my skin so i cannot say how well that would hide that imperfection but i would guess very good after setting this with powder it lasted most of the day and i did not have to reapply is considered a prestige beauty brand and you can find in some of your favorite beauty stores overall , nicely done
5	this is one concealer that is worthy of its name it takes very little to conceal anything from sunspots to bruising often seen in the elderly as their skin ages do be careful to snap the lid in place , though this concealer is very smooth and moist and i suspect would lose much of its efficacy if it dried out and the cap is by no means a natural snap on
5	i thought this would be a neat thing to get for my wife so i did she , this is a very soft , fluffy make up brush with a wrapped handle \( which makes it easy to find even by touch only in the make up drawer \) feels very soft on the skin i first tried it with my blush and it was n't stiff enough for that job washed the bristles \( to make sure all the blush was out \) then tried again with my mineral veil setting powder this is what this brush is designed for ! great light application of powder foundation , although i still prefer my brush for this step gives more coverage , or foundation setting powder \( like bare minerals mineral veil \) the brush gives a feather light finish to your made up face and feels really soft against your skin i recommend it highly ! natural bristles are easy to clean periodically with a facial soap and it 's made really well so there you have it i hope this helps
4	good product but not better then burt 's bees
4	my skin is really sensitive it breaks out with most lotions and cleansers it does n't like to be with i 've found out so as much as it kills me i often let it go on its own with the occasional help from a cleanser in the hotter months i 've always wanted to try one of these machines but i worried that my face would have a luckily for me the nu brilliance works beautifully and did n't cause any issues after use with my face ! ! i 've noticed that pores appear smaller and fine lines are not quite as defined i definitely love this machine and am glad i have it !
4	this is a very silky , creamy textured concealer that allows you to mix shades to conceal blemishes with a nearly perfect match to your skin tone , provided you do your part to get the color mix proper it does a good job at concealing minor blemishes , but darker spots will shine through with ease as the day wears on , this concealer does n't really wear off \( if you are active and sweat a lot or in a high humidity area , all are off as this will slide right off your face quickly \) , so it does provide a level of confidence throughout the day in a typical office environment those will oily skin such as mine might have a little more trouble getting it to conceal , as it does n't seem to want to have any staying power as the skin 's oils build up throughout the day overall it 's a nice product , but it is n't a miracle product i 'd say it 's on par with most well known drug store brands
5	greatest dry shampoo out there for blonde hair doesnt dry mine out
4	i 've used other xen tan products in the last but not this mousse i have very pale legs and like a bit of color in them for yoga this mousse goes on very easily with the optional mitt \( sold separately \) i recommend duty mitt i 've done this with disposable gloves and the mitt gives more even , streak free coverage the scent is quite pleasant , a warm vanilla fragrance with this product you need to leave it on for 3 hours before washing off the good news is that it dries fairly quickly and then you can dress \( dark clothes advised \) it is a big cold here in wi to sit around waiting 3 hours to take a shower there is probably enough in the one container to do my legs 3 or 4 times the results are quite dark on me but very even the color lasts about a week my only criticism is the 3 hour wait i pretty much have to plan my day around it otherwise , good stuff
5	after 2 weeks , even though i am during my monthly hormonal that generally results in more breakouts , i have noticed that my skin is indeed more clear so on that basis alone this is a 5 star skin kit ! the textures and colors are different than any skin care items i 've tried before they are n't like a lotion or soap , but especially the wash feels very liquidy the color was initially a turn off \( think poop brown \) , but if feels good going on , smells neutral \( like a actually \) , and based on my experience , it works i appreciate the fact that i am putting something on my face with ingredients that i can pronounce and know what they are i 've always been iffy on the pharmaceutical skin care products wondering just how much of that is getting into my system and what it 's doing there
5	lotion feels great on skin and appears to smooth , if not totally erase , crepey area i just ordered another round
4	it was a gift and there are no complaints
4	nice shade thanks amazon for carrying such great variety of products well done
5	pretty color sheer with a bit of shimmer
4	i am really liking this brand this shade seems to be the closest to my natural skin tone it applies easily and stays on , but after a few hours i do see residue in my pores that perhaps comes with the territory of being a powder it lessens redness and small discolorations and even works around under the eyes works well in photography , too
4	this lotion leaves my hands feeling silky smooth but has such a strong fragrance to it i do n't mind the fragrance but , man , it sure is strong ! if you are at all sensitive to fragrances or are around someone who is i would suggest avoiding this product despite how well it works
3	i 've purchased the eye repair cream 2 times now no problems with it but i do think it 's a little waxy and i get a residue near outer corners of my eyes definately see an improvement to my eyelids , especially with the upper eye area would purchase this again the 3 5 rating because i 've used some really top products out there but yes this is a good product
5	i love the l'occitane shea cleansing oil it is strong enough to remove my waterproof mascara , but it does n't irritate my eyes i do n't have to rub to get my makeup best of all this oil is water soluble so it washes off after you 've wiped off the makeup leaving your skin moisturized and fresh feeling smells good too
4	nice polish , but very much like others made by this company in micro sparkle color coats , a clear polish that goes over other polishes for a kick
4	i have the kind of hair that looks like a disaster area in the mornings , and requires brushing and fussing to look like anything this pomade was a bit stiff for my purposes , but had great hold without having the that i 've found with some other products i used it for nights out and parties it gave that sort of look to my locks that was n't everyday this stuff is a lot more touchable than other pomades i 've used , but still not quite ideal , so i'm cutting a star still , i strongly recommend this
4	ive used both the mary kay and bare minerals version of this powdered foundation this is different in two ways the first is that you twist the compact to the foundation to provide you with the powder , versus turning the container over and giving it a shake to get powder to a place you can where you can pick it up the other is that instead of one solid color , part of it is white and its up to you to mix together completely or not i really like that aspect as our faces are n't naturally one color , so putting on a foundation with more than one color that is n't perfectly mixed actually looks less like you 're wearing something while covering up minor imperfections this does a great job with covering up fine lines and discolorations , and gives my complexion a smoother look without my normal reddened blotchiness i have n't needed to reapply as the day goes on the brush is a short bristle compared to others ive used for this type of foundation product , although its incredibly soft and narrow that does allow for more refined placement if you 're going lighter or darker in a specific area i cant begin to understand how why its described as something that exfoliates , though i expect your washcloth would do a better job for that
5	i have some scars on my neck that make me self conscious about wearing lower , and i have tried a number of makeup options for coverage with great disappointment the problem is that if the coverage is adequate , the result was a like , cakey appearance in fact , i did try a product that was originally used by good coverage always a bad look until i tried this wonderful product that seems to melt right into my skin and cover my scars ! it is quite easy to use and i think the warmth of fingers make it just the right consistency to cover but not look artificial apply just like you would a regular foundation , then apply your regular foundation right over top of \( if you wish \) it for a very natural appearance i am a middle aged woman , and this product did not accentuate any lines or wrinkles , which is a miracle ! i am very happy with the results achieved with this concealer
3	the nuxe detox facial lotion is a lightly scented and skin softening lotion as a i age , i notice my skin look and texture is changing from normal oily to normal dry this means i'm much more prone to wrinkling and flakiness i have asian skin , no particular product sensitivities , and i generally wear sunscreen lotion on my face during the day the nuxe lotion is working well at keeping my skin well hydrated in the evening , and i 've noticed that it does a good job at minimizing the dry patches on my face as well i have n't had any issues with breakouts or allergic reactions , and for the most part , my skin looks very good in the morning after use i only need one or two pumps of lotion to effectively cover my entire face , and since i'm using so little product , the bottle does last quite a while while i do like this lotion , at 75 per bottle , i was expecting a much more dramatic difference in skin condition after extended period of use unfortunately , i do n't think this lotion works any better than comparable lotions purchased at my local department store beauty supply counter without naming specific brands , i have used lotions that are about half the cost of this lotion and experienced similar results with that in mind , this lotion does work very well it 's just much pricier than i would like to spend on a facial lotion like most skin products , results will vary depending on individuals for me , it was worth a try , but likely not a lotion i would purchase in the future
3	given the term cleansing oil i rather expected this to be a general facial cleanser , but that may just be my mistake i did n't find it to work well as a general cleanser at all although it creates a nice , muted foam that has a texture , it does n't completely wash off my skin decidedly felt far too oily after using this , unless i used a different cleanser soap to wash it off that said , it did a pretty good job as just a makeup remover i could easily see sticking this on your bathroom sink and pumping a little onto a cotton ball or pad at night to wipe off one 's makeup with before washing your face it did a good job of removing mascara , eyeshadow , etc \( though nothing i was wearing was waterproof , so i ca n't speak to that specifically \) it 's worth noting that it did not perform better than straight coconut oil in that respect , however , which is much cheaper i'm about the scent i usually like l'occitane 's scents , but this one did n't quite work for me it 's not obnoxious or overbearing , but there 's something off about it it seemed okay when i first opened it and gave a sniff , but i noticed when i went to use it at night that it did n't tend to agree with me as much just personal preference there , but i think the scent would be enough to me from picking it up again it would be worth your while to try to find this in person somewhere and give it a sniff before you invest
5	this works wonders on pores ! it shrinks your pores and cleans your face so well i use it after washing my face and it removes remaining dirt and makeup i'm very happy with my purchase ! i love all of my products from this line
5	i knew about makeup setting spray , but i figured it was like hairspray , and i do n't like hairspray , so i was very hesitant to try it i thought my face would turn into a mask ! not so ! this spray lightly sets your makeup in a very natural way ! just follow the directions you 'll like the results
5	excellent product you wo n't be sorry !
5	great ! amazing ! !
5	i really love this stuff it stays put with hairspray i have been using it for a while and will keep on buying it but i noticed if i have lots of hair products on the scalp , it does n't stick as well so , be careful not to put too much product close to the scalp
4	tizo ultra zinc tinted sunscreen is broad spectrum , spf 40 , and water resistant to me these are all important components of a sunscreen i 've used a few different zinc sunscreens over the last few years and most of them are heavy making them hard to rub in to your skin leaving your face and body where you applied the sunscreen looking whiter the tizo tinted sunscreen rubs blends in much easier than i have experienced with other sunscreens since it is tinted , it does n't leave the white residue on your skin it does leave you feeling like you have something on your skin i would say most similar to the feeling of wearing a makeup foundation it definitely feels like by the end of the day you need to wash it off like you would your makeup the bottle is big enough to last awhile if you are only using it daily on your face if you do use this as a sunscreen for your body it will of course not last as long
5	this medium coverage foundation blends easily with your skin just a single coat applies enough coverage it does not feel greasy at all does not have any scent , which is good very light and not heavy and does n't cake a small amount goes a long way this particular color , copper , was a good match for my girlfriend 's skin and she is from the philippines it will conceal flaws , spf 25 provides protection from the sun , and it can also make you look more tanned than you are obviously , select the right color so , pretty good stuff , but just be aware of the aforementioned limitations 5 stars
4	update it 's been 8 months and this is still my go to for when i want to let my hair air dry ! ! i love this stuff and will definitely continue to use it only thing is , if you live in a place with high humidity it might not be that great i find on humid rainy days my hair does get frizzy pretty quickly i have dry frizzy hair , that has some curl wave to it i'm always in search of a product that will allow me to air dry my hair \( i hate blow drying \) and just go and i think this one might finally do the trick it gave my curls definition but no crunch like you might get from gels or mousses and also did n't dry into a big poofy mess like it normally does a for this product my only issue was that the tube was n't sealed and leaked during shipping
5	love anything by la roche posay i have used this product for the last 10 years excellent quality my dermatologist introduced me to this line prompt delivery !
5	the skinmedica total defense sunscreen works well with my wifes facial skin some of the face lotions with screen out there makes her face dry , this does not she said it applies easily and does not have any scent which she prefers
5	i like the gel polished this is a nice color remember , it will be sticky through the entire process , untill you finish and wipe the nails with any will do you can use regular polish on top , when it starts to grow out putting off a new manicure a couple more weeks
3	my skin is normal to dry , sensitive , and breaks out if i put any lotion or product on it i am a very fair skinned 34 year old white female this serum absorbs nicely , but did cause me to break out \( no different than other products on my skin \) the breakout was minimal , but nonetheless started about 3 days after i began using , causing me to stop i did not have any redness or burning from this product though i was hoping that i would be able to finally use something to assist with aging skin as i think my years are starting to catch up with me , but unfortunately this is not the miracle product i was hoping for
5	i like the dark sparkly midnight blue color !
5	exactly what i expected
5	i love this color essie is always a hit or miss for me this is definitely a hit ! plus i love the name !
4	i like pit boss deodorant better than the new aluminum free version this at least lasts longer through the day and helps with perspiration
3	la roche posay is a brand i have come to love as i have been extremely happy with their facial sunscreens for years this tone correcting primer with mineral sunscreen for sensitive skin \( with spf 50 \) is a new product unfortunately , i found the cream too thick to be able to apply lightly and evenly as for the spf rating , i usually buy the spf 45 and do n't think this will be much different it has always protected my sensitive skin from getting red or burning , even when i only apply it in the morning
5	love this product really love it i swear i look 10 years younger am 50 and was getting some fine lines when i wake up my eyes look like i am 20 !
5	i 've been using this toner for over a month and i'm crazy about it ! although this is marketed towards men , i'm a 39 year old woman and it 's been wonderful for my very sensitive , slightly oily skin i use it after i wash my face and it removes all traces of makeup it does n't dry my skin out and it has helped to clear up any hormonal breakouts that i get this toner has a very pleasing herbal mint scent that is unisex my skin feels refreshed and looks healthy i could n't be happier and i recommend this for both males and females
2	i'm a huge essie fan and loved this color in the salon bought on amazon and it was goopy and not the quality i 've learned to expect something was off
5	very nice but the tube is too small
5	my sister gave me some of this nail polish for my birthday and i wanted a new fun color i'm over the winter and wanted something springy even though it 's december and outside this polish applies wonderfully , dries fast and wears beautifully
5	this is a lovely cleanser that foams up wonderfully i rarely get any full on ugly nasty pimples because when there is any signs of them , i whip out this trusty cleanser and it significantly reduces the lifespan of the pimple my pimple sort of up and die
5	there is no eye cream that works for crows feet as well as this one i have tried brands and i keep coming back to this
5	love this for my toes and the color is amazing i would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others
4	the color was a lot darker than i had expected it reminds me of sally hasen 's brick wall , which i already have
5	the active ingredient is a recent development in hyaluronic acid molecular hyaluronic acid is a large molecule as molecules go and far larger than skin nonetheless , hyaluronic acid has been a very effective skin treatment for us the large molecular chain should improve skin penetration weve been fans of hyaluronic acid for some years the stuff works this is a silky smooth , slightly scented application we like it ill keep you updated
1	i wet shave every time i 've been using straight razors and safety razors \( double edge \) razors for years i ordered this because their was n't much to choose from this last time i now wish i 'd ordered a bag of or something this stuff is like a soft version of noxzema the smell is medicine like and the shave was not very comfortable or close , and it does n't build a very good lather i was going to throw it away , but my wife may give it a go on her legs in the shower do n't waste your money on this if you want a good shave go with conk glycerin shave soap it comes in several different , pleasant aromas , and gives a superior shave to any canned or tub type cremes i almost feel after using this product , compared to what i'm used to i prefer using edge to this if you have to go the easy route nothing beats the lather you get from a quality shave soap once you learn the technique of how to build a good lather this stuff took to get enough to get a less than adequate lather , and the shave was not close , and my face is raw , like i almost did n't use any lather might be a good cold creme for removing makeup on women , but it 's lousy for removing a beard
5	love the product
5	immediately following use , complexion has a healthy natural glow skin appearance starts to improve with the first time used pores start becoming smaller and smile lines around the eyes start to diminish the product feels slightly tingly , which is n't an issue and does n't last long our daughter has used this before on her sensitive skin without issue she was happy with it and believes it works leaving skin well exfoliated , with a clean natural shine but more importantly , an over all blending of tighter , more vibrate skin , fainter lines step one helps skin , and is preparation for application of step two dispense a quarter size amount in palm , with fingertips , apply uniform layer over clean face leave sit for 1 minute , do n't remove apply step two on top step two is an excellent exfoliating treatment dispense a quarter size amount in palm , with fingertips , apply uniform layer over detoxifying primer leave for 3 5 minutes , remove with damp towel and rinse with warm water always use together for best results use 1 2 times per week even at costco , which happens to carrier a couple strivectinlabs anti aging products , this brand is fairly expensive \( 90 00 100 00 \) product statement as close to anti aging treatments as you can get with out the dermatologist contains 5 nia 114 10 aha acid 10 aha
5	is the last thing i do when i finish to dry my hair , is the last touch ! it work wonders ! !
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	i 've only used this product about 3 times it does cut the drying time in half , but for me it did n't do a lot more i have very long layered ombre hair and it is a bit as is fairly dry except for the root area of my hair i think given the length of my hair and how it does cut my dry time in half it 's worth it and a little goes a very long way i can see it lasting a long time the mild fragrance is to die for ! ! as for making is soft or taming frizz i ca n't say as my hair as i said does n't look to pretty until it is styled to calm the hair that are slightly blown from processing the ombre i have going on
4	this is an amusing product an all in one wash that looks and smells like fine whiskey they really nailed the scent , which is pleasant and masculine although described as tobacco , it smells nothing like a cigarette , which is a relief if the idea of a whiskey themed body wash appeals to you , look no further !
5	i love it it does wonders for my hair it 's really improved over the years does not come off on your hands or pillow cases makes your hair look fuller
5	perfect shade between orange pink red i am very particular about the color i use , and this is the perfect bright happy pick me up shade lots of compliments on it !
5	i 've never used a cream blush and usually wear very little , if any , make up i decided to give this product a try though and am happy with the results my first try , i ended up putting way too much on and it looked like i had gotten a sun burn the next try , i used a just a small dab and it worked much better , giving me a little color without making me look sun burnt i like that the application is easy i ca n't use powder based make up because they typically contain corn products and i'm allergic to corn , so breathing in the little corn dust in powders is not good for me i do n't know if this product is comprised of corn , but since i ca n't breathe it in , i do n't get sick from using it i did a little research on the jane iredale company and was happy to learn that they are cruelty free and do n't allow their products to be sold in china any company that sells make up or food products in china is required to either test their products on animals themselves or pay for a chinese company to do the testing i wish more companies would take a stand against animal testing in this way
4	to me felt as very rich and smooth body lotion the color of the cream is pink , and probably towards more on the peach side i liked the feel and how it made my skin look , but unfortunately the scent leaves much to be desired as other reviews have said , to my taste the smell borders on that of medicine , which i personally do n't like
5	i love this moisture primer even more than i expected ! first , it provides a light , non greasy moisture it smooths on easily , dries fast , and feels refreshing it 's full of good things for the skin , which i love my skin already feels smoother and softer , and i'm sure as i use it longer , i 'll start to notice the anti aging benefits of the hyaluronic acid and other antioxidants next , it helps my make up apply easily , smoothly , and last longer it leaves my made up face looking smooth , and really enhances my make up i can absolutely tell a difference on the days i use this , compared to those days i skip it as i'm writing this review , i realize i have n't even noticed a smell from the primer the container is rather small i do wish it came with a little more in it really , this anti aging primer is a great product that i would buy again and recommend to others
4	this cream as a high surface area coverage ratio so you need to use a fairly small amount to get a natural looking finish my wife does n't have oily skin and found the cream easy to apply and effective
4	this is a good quality eye shadow you do not need to apply a lot on your skin \( small amount goes a long way \) , but i do wish the pink section showed up a little more on my eyelid \( i have light skin \)
5	i'm 41 my skin , around my eyes , is still seemingly elastic enough that i do n't feel like i need firming , specifically , from an eye cream , but i'm glad i gave the ahava time to revitalize a shot as it works beautifully as an eye cream period \( not just for extreme firming , which i cannot judge as extreme or sagging is not an issue i am faced with at this point , at least around my eyes i may have to try this on the other 98 of my body and get back to you \) i have very sensitive skin and i have dry eye \( i have plugs and use daily drops \) as part of autoimmune arthritis my eyes itch constantly as we have two which trigger my skin and eye allergies i am raising a special needs teenager and it has been a bumpy couple of years when i do sleep , i sleep on my side , in fits of 30 60 minutes and i'm always exhausted and dragging my bones around and since turning 40 last year , i just do n't bounce back from the stress and lack of sleep like i once did and it shows that i have often just dragged myself out of bed to go to a doctor 's appointment or to help my folks or to pick up my son from school because i sleep on my side , i usually have one eye which has a lovely , bluish purple swelling underneath it and the skin around the other one looks dehydrated and like it found some bonus creasing while i was attempting to nap i pat a little ahava around both eyes and within a few minutes the sides look fairly equal , with most of the blue and the swelling reduced and both eyes look less creased \( i have less i never sleep and i'm getting old fine creases but leaves the i have laughed so much at so many things my whole life that i love \) and everything looks and feels youthful and calm and refreshed i feel slightly more alert and definitely feel less like a completely stressed mama and more like a human being yeah , i know it 's eye cream it 's not a miracle worker it is , though , one of the tiny moments that i take for myself and that it leaves me looking and feeling better about just that one part of me is pretty sweet i am curious to try more of the ahava products , as this is the first eye cream i remember to use daily my sensitive eyes have not enjoyed previous eye creams or i did n't enjoy them for some reason \( some are sticky or heavily perfumed \) enough to use daily and frequently ahava time to revitalize applies smoothly , without stickiness and it 's not greasy it is absorbed quickly and skin feels softer , more supple , and hydrated but not slimy , greasy , or wet
5	this stuff is better than head slick which is what i used before this i did use a brush and bowl and it really makes a difference totally lathering all sides of the whiskers i could not be happier with this and my new merkur 180
2	this hair gel does what it promises in that it wo n't make hair crunchy however , it also fails to hold a style to any significant degree we gave it a good effort for about a month with my son 's hair and decided that it simply does n't work to maintain his pretty simple styling either not much else really needs to be mentioned in a review of this unfortunately
5	beautiful color just like the bottle shellac are excellent gel polishes , i use them in my salon , people love pinks and this one is like a hot pink
5	this is the perfect medium brown color for fall very polished look , and a great change from the normal bright colors
5	what a great price for a great product makes my skin very soft and smooth
4	used this to apply powered foundation to my face it gives great coverage , the brush fits nicely in my hand as well i like the angled bristles makes application around the nose area easier what i did not like is the face the black bristles kept falling out on my face as i swirled the foundation around that got annoying but as for ease of use and coverage it is a great tool
4	this serum seems designed to help lessen redness on those who suffer from rosacea , and since i am in the beginning of the condition , i decided to give it a try after using it morning and night , as directed underneath moisturizer , i found that it had some effect not a miracle , mind you , but enough for me to continue using it it took a few days , however , before i noticed any difference i apply this primarily on my cheeks and nose , where my red skin is most obvious , and it takes only a small amount dispensed from the pump to cover that area , with some left over to rub into surrounding areas i found the serum to be scentless and mild , with no burning \( sometimes tingling \) on my sensitve skin i'm careful to apply in gentle circular motions with my fingertips so i do n't irritate and redden my skin with rubbing this is n't a cure , of course , but it works well enough to make a difference debbie lee wesselmann
5	this nailpolish has a little shimmer to it i love this nailpolish i 've worn it several times since i 've purchased it
3	i have very sensitive eyes and take allergy medication regularly i have dark circles under my eyes and one of them waters regularly particularly with eye makeup i am sharing this because my own health issues may be affecting my results with this product for me , it made no difference whatsoever my experience was it did n't make my dark circles and puffiness worse and there was no noticeable change i also used it to be honest when my eyes felt irritated , i did n't use it
5	this product is amazing ! it smells like heaven and works great to moisturize your skin
5	i love using this product you really can not go wrong with jack black !
5	i have n't been using it long and i can already tell there 's improvement i have been so frustrated with random break outs on my chest and back i 've tried all kinds of washes , performed the same routines i do with my face and got the same results , regardless i am very pleased with this purchase and i plan to buy more products from this line !
4	i had bought a cheaper contour palette and was n't happy with it i decided to splurge and get this and it 's much better the colors are good , probably best for medium to darker skin tones i'm very pale right now and i use the light contour shade and it is plenty dark and pigmented i will probably use the other two shades in the summer i like that one of the highlighters is shimmery and the other 2 are matte the contour is very pigmented and does not take a lot of product to show up when i use too much , it is hard to blend and ends up looking dirty a little goes a long way , which is a good thing since it will last a long time the 2 matte highlight shades could be a tad more pigmented i do n't see much difference between the 2 colors overall a good product !
5	i love their products
4	this polish is hard to get despite its popularity for the last 3 4 years that is why a purchase two bottles in case this color will be discontinue \( which i hope not \) its the real essie polish no problems with the delivery and the package was secure amazon did it once again
5	i do n't know how it would work as a makeup removes , but on makeup free skin it works like a charm i previously used mb 's acne cleanser since i have an oily t zone and hormonal acne on my chin but this is just better , more balanced , less stripping mario 's top product
4	if the color had been a better match for me , it would have been almost perfect its possible that , as i get a little darker in the summer , it might be a better match right now , i had to remove some of it \( using a slightly moist cotton pad \) because it was a poor match for my skin color the light beige color , which sounds like it should be a good match for me is ok in intensity but leans towards a light colored band aid color that has too much tint for my skin objectively speaking , i have more yellow in my skin and this shade has more brownish pink it is easy to apply it goes on smoothly without leaving tracks or demarcation lines the more you smooth it on , the better it absorbs i like the way it evens out skin color i have tiny little red veins that make me look as if im overdoing the blush powder and this crme covers it up without a painted on look \( even though it is less yellow than it should be \) it also fills the pores just enough for smoothness and without looking artificial i have very dry skin , but it feels light when wearing it and is easy to remove at the end of the day even though i was at an outdoor event that started during a warm late afternoon and went on to around 11 in the evening , the coverage was by sweating or the of time photographs taken \( with a lens that is very \) looked natural and did not reflect flash spots many friends commented on how good and relaxed i looked and asked if i had lost weight go figure ! the one star that i took off a perfect rating was not for the color match it is because it is only a finish granted , it is a good little face powder and maybe blush and you 're at your absolute best but it doesnt contain spf protection \( a must in florida \) or a moisturizer \( although , frankly , it feels soft as if it its the hyaluronic acid \? \) you must first lay a foundation of those basic products and then add this as the final many steps for everyday use this makes it somewhat less practical and more labor intensive than an all in one product its something i will use for special occasions when i want to look really good for a really long time
3	this ended up being too yellow for me if you have fair skin with pink undertones do not purchase
5	exactly what i expected
5	i really like these products the sunscreens are both really nice \( face and body \) i am already all out of the body and will likely buy more from this brand i also really liked the after sun lotion , and am very happy to have a lip balm with spf the balm is n't really moisturizing , so you ca n't likely use it as a day to day lip balm , but it 's great for days when you 'll be in the sun a lot the bag it comes in is also great for travel ! very cute and large
5	i purchased the shade and wow ! the picture of it is gorgeous but it does not do it justice it 's so much prettier in reality !
5	this is as good a medicated gel exfoliator for skin as any other as well , including proactive i have few breakouts since i have used such a product , and this one is no exception sometimes a product like this will appear to cause a breakout or two initially , or if i use it too much not sure that i know how that is happening there overall , i see clear skin , and over a week i have used it twice i am only using this 4 x per month , because i have dry skin this product is much like others in a class i would call premium i 'd like to say more however , at my age , i need to moisturize , moisturize after using a product like this it is fitting , though , to use this as i do need the benefits of this product recommended
5	love love love my favorite scrub !
2	too much flowery scent , but at least it dissipates after rinsing i like shampoos that lather others have said this lathers a lot , but i do n't find that to be the case my hair felt dirty quicker when using this shampoo compared to others i 've used , most of the time it 's paul mitchell products that i use i also did n't notice more shine , but that 's hard to achieve when you color your hair blonde as far as my coloring job longer , that takes time to evaluate
5	love this night cream ! makes my skin feel so smooth in the mornings it 's not too greasy and does n't break me out it does n't brighten skin or help fade dark spots but my skin feels supple
3	this looks shiny in the picture but it is really flat i have n't worn this color yet because of that one day i might try it but its the holiday season now and i want cheerful looking nails
5	this is a generous sample sized jar it is my 3rd little jar of this size i find they last about 2 weeks each with 1x nightly use , or a bit less if used more often , because a little of this goes a long way for me i think this small jar is overall a good value , and certainly , big enough to really have a chance to work , if it is going to , for any given individual if you like it , then you can buy the larger sized jars for me , it works great it is one of my favorite all times anti aging creams , and in general , i really enjoy the vichy brand this does not pill , and it goes on and spreads well , and absorbs well and it leaves my skin feeling overall moist , with just a tad of a natural like oily feeling , not greasy , but like my skin was when i was younger instead of being parched all the time like it is now that i am 50 this works well with serums underneath it , or alone it 's also a good under makeup moisturizer i have not found that it reacts with my makeup to cause piling or shorter wear time all that is one of the reasons it is my favorite these little jars are cute too they are good quality , small enough for a travel bag or desk , and pleasant to hold and use there 's a bit of scent with the product , but it 's very light , and not bad or unpleasant in any way after i put it on , i ca n't smell it it 's very subtle even in the jar with my nose stuck down to it , but it 's not what i 'd call unscented either it does n't smell like perfume , it seems like just the natural smell that emollients have
1	this is not the real thing it 's fake and a horrible one at that if i could put zero stars i would so disappointed
4	steam flat irons are definitely the best they make your hair straighter and shinier and softer and it lasts longer that way i thought the cool mist might be different , but it 's really not this iron is fine , very good even i just have a really excellent steam iron with combing teeth to compare it to , so i'm not as impressed as i could be
5	i started using somme last november \( 2012 \) and just ran out of serum in june by contrast i ran out of everything else long before that i'm not sure how great a product it is , in and of itself , but in concert with the other somme products it makes my skin look great
4	this conditioner is very light and not greasy nice scent and one bottle goes a long way , since you only need to use a small amount to condition
3	at first glance this seems to be a promising product but unfortunately in spite of the really cool packaging it fails to deliver the case of this concealer is fabulous , the color scheme is pretty and it comes with a handy mirror the concealer glides on smoothly and has a velvety feel , as far as coverage it did cover conceal very well i used it under my eye and to cover a few blemishes the section under my eye got streaky midday , and the tint on top of my blemishes sort of changed to a yellow tint i have admit that when i put it on maybe the light i had did n't show the color difference right off the bat but the product creasing is a huge no no even with the right shade as much as i loved the packaging i'm not impressed with the concealer itself
4	made a great gift for a friends birthday ! the color is beautiful ! i would highly reccommend this product to anyone
5	i use this almost daily with the jouer moisturizing tint in golden it provides a deep , rich bronze with minimal effort and lasts all day i think that the packaging was a bit interesting , until you realize that it is designed to fit in with other products in the same line it was a bit smaller then i anticipated , but given how far a little bit goes i would not consider this a problem the jouer tint matte bronzer have become two of my daily go to 's for a natural , easy look i have a feeling this may be my new favorite line highly recommend !
4	ahava products are a staple in my house when i was offered a night cream to try , i immediately tried it the night cream was not oily , but light and kept my skin feeling so soft it was a little too heavy for day use , however i looked for a day cream i have normal skin , and i have kept good care of it a few wrinkles and lines no doubt , but i am also of age , and people often tell me i look much younger i use an expensive day moisturizer , and i am always looking for a moisturizer that will keep my skin in its great condition i am pretty sure i have found it with this day moisturizer a light cream that i apply daily right after i have cleansed my skin my skin retains its moisture , and my skin is very smooth very happy with this moisturizer , a nice light scent , a moisturizer that is equal to the expensive moisturizer i use mature skin with a good foundation is open to this moisturizer young women would do well to start with this ahava brand of moisturizer recommended prisrob 09 27 16
5	love it
5	i will say , this stuff smells fairly bad if that bothers you , do n't buy it it does n't linger for very long , but one of the biggest things i see reviewers complaining about is scent in terms of how well it works , i 've seen noticeable improvement \( with consistent use \) in about a week seems to help keep my skin clear and i can definitely see the hyperpigmentation fading \( some newer spots disappeared entirely already \) just make sure to use a sunscreen or you 're basically starting all over again
4	does what it 's supposed to do ! it takes a lot more than the drops recommended in the directions but it is still worth it
3	a little about me first i am not someone who uses a foundation every day , or hardly ever ! if it 's a special occasion \( wedding , etc \) , i might pull out a tinted moisturizer or light base , but that 's about it so why would i want to try a primer \? well , when i'm out in the sun , i do try to use a product with spf on my face also , because my skin tends towards oily , with large pores , i do prefer something that might give me a bit of coverage in those situations , especially if i 'll be at a pool beach similar and not wearing much other makeup the first thing about this product is that the container is confusing ! you pull off the cap okay , i got that then , you have to twist the inner cap 180 degrees , going from where it says off to on this is very hard to see , as the writing is embossed once i did that , i was still not able to dispense the product i thought i had done something wrong ! it took me awhile to realize that i just had to get the product started by shaking it down to the end of the tube and squeezing a bit eventually , i was able to produce some product to my surprise , it is white i guess i was expecting more of a tinted moisturizer when i first used the toner , i loved it ! it seemed to give my skin a luminous quality and to actually reduce the appearance of my dark undereye circles , something i can usually only control with moisturizer i was so happy i quickly applied this to my entire face ! unfortunately , i soon saw why this is meant more as a primer , not a stand alone product when applied to my whole face , i thought it made my face look somewhat unnatural furthermore , over the course of the day , it felt heavy on my face \( this is why i do n't generally wear foundation ! \) , and it made my face oiler rather than helped to control oil i find if i just use a bit of this product in my eye area , it is helpful it does improve the look of my dark circles , and it also seems to help my eye shadow to adhere last longer but it feels to heavy for me to use all over , either with or without foundation , and i personally would not recommend it for this purpose
3	i got it on basis of reviews yes , its good but not awesome i am looking for something even better ! and if your face is not well washed or if you have not taken a shower and try to shave , using this cream will not help you avoid cuts and on your face and neck buy it but do n't expect it to be sensational having said that , jack black is a awesome brand
4	delicacy is closer to a light peach or pink peach shade with a very muted shimmer very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point
3	was really thick like it was old ! and you cannot return back to amazon so you are stuck with it
5	a few minutes ago , as i was preparing to sit down to write this review , my husband admitted to me that he was curious about these products and had used the breast firming cream on the loose skin under his chin he 's impressed ! i 've been using it as well mostly in the areas of my d eacute colletage and we have both noticed the firming up of that skin it 's a cool gel that goes on with little fragrance i use a single pump on my neck and collar area and work it in until it has fully absorbed you can even feel a tightening sensation i would recommend the breast serum very highly to anyone who is interested in toning up those tender skin areas under the chin it would also benefit those who have recently lost weight and have a little bit of extra skin to contend with every day i give this half of the review 5 stars the stretch mark prevention cream is very nice too but i do n't know how revolutionary it is it has a stronger fragrance than the bust cream and goes on smoothly with fast absorption it does n't make your hands feel greasy the fragrance is a bit much when used on the top part of the body it 's easier to take if you keep in the belly , and upper thigh area it contains agents that help promote your skin to manufacture collagen and encourages elasticity it also has shea butter in it to moisturize the skin a regular routine using high quality ingredients like these should help reduce or eliminate stretch marks i would give this product 4 stars on its own overall , this is a great set that would make a wonderful gift to a newly mother
3	if you 've arrived at this page , it 's probably because you are looking for a product that addresses dark spots or a moisturizer pigmentclar daily dark spot correcting moisturizer purports to do both as a sun lover back in the day , i up thousands of freckles at the time , i thought they were cute i did n't realize they were an indication of sun damage i was hoping that this product would help address some of that damage , but the active ingredients are all standard components of chemical sunscreen avobenzone , homosalate , octisalate , octocrylene avobenzone in particular is getting some bad press lately if you 're a chemical sunscreen fan , then you 've probably already accepted the risks to yourself and the environment let 's move on this product is n't promoted primarily as a sunscreen , but i had to do some research to figure out how pigmentclar was supposed to fight dark spots their website describes a powerful complex of phe resorcinol ginkgo ferulic acid lha we know ferulic acid is good for skin \( how much is in this product , we cannot tell \) , ginkgo , sure , why not , works on alzheimer 's and other memory and the leaves are pretty so it ca n't hurt lha is normally used in acne treatments phe resorcinol is new to me , but apparently it 's a proprietary brightening ingredient that is 100 times as potent as vitamin c potent in what way \? this is not explained i already apply topical c to my skin every day , and would love to use anything that 's more potent i try not to spend much time in the sun , but because i as a , i ca n't avoid it completely i 've been using the pigmentclar the last few weeks though it seems to protect adequately against the sun , it makes my face shiny so it 's hands and arms only from now on until the tube is empty the tube offers one big advantage , and the product consistency not as watery as many sunscreens makes it easy to dispense just the right amount no running around with a big glob of sunscreen in your hand asking if anyone needs an extra dose of protection apart from that , this does n't seem to offer anything that your drugstore chemical sunscreen wo n't provide , at a much higher price point than that tube of drugstore product
3	very small bottles you apply both morning and night clean face neck the ingredients are pretty standard , nothing earth shattering i have noticed no difference in my skin yet it feels nice and moisturized though you 're supposed to use it for several months before you see results i will update my review in the future if i see any results
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
2	i really should have gone to the store rather than trusting how colors would translate from online to in person since i'm a fan of butter london , it seemed like a safe gamble wow was i wrong the color \( such a fun name , like all their colors \) looks nothing like the photo i thought it was going to be a delicious medium pink and it 's actually rather , a pink sad
5	this is a nice color and it wears well
5	i bought the older version of this product a few months ago and used it for my newborn during winter he has extremely dry skin so i purchased both the lotion and balm version of this product the new version is the same as the old , the tube is huge and you really only need a little at a time so it goes a long way it moisturizes quickly and though leaves a slight tacky feeling , is easily absorbed and soothes my son 's skin immediately for those wondering , i did not find any big discernible difference between the lotion and balm version of this product unlike the typical balm i am used to which is usually very thick and sometimes even in a solid state , this is in a lotion form and is easily squeezable and applied
1	broke out
5	a must have color
4	i am familiar with bliss products both from our local spa and from using their great body butter the body butter is the greatest for adding moisture to really dry skin , but not for getting rid of wrinkles , creases or crepiness this bliss leave it to cleavage says you 'll notice a difference in one day to see if there is a difference in only one day , i applied the cream on one half of my chest , up to the neck following their directions the next morning , i did not see any difference , but i did feel a difference my skin felt way smoother , silkier and tighter , but the creases were still there so , i used it again every night and on the fourth night , when i went to apply the cream , there was a noticeable difference on the deepest creases i was very impressed that in only three applications , the deepest creases on my upper chest were actually less deep since then , i have applied it for a full week and i do see a visible difference in the really deep crease lines they not only look less deep , but my skin feels silky smooth i see no difference in any wrinkles or crepiness , only in the deep chest creases the cream itself is silky light , not greasy with a slight perfume smell i will be using this every night , as lessening deep creases is a huge nice improvement , but i have yet to find anything that helps get rid of the crepe skin in the upper chest neck area , that i had been hoping for
5	great product it has kept my skin smooth and acne free for almost two years now
3	not quite as bright aqua as expected and shown but still a great color !
4	i do n't really have wrinkles but they tell you to start using preventative measures when you 're young , but i love the feel of this serum i do my usual face routine , clean and apply moisturizer with this serum and i have noticed most elasticity in my face it 's more plump so it 's working ! let 's just hope i do n't wrinkles until way later on in life !
5	love it
4	this concealer brush is nice and light , and comfortable to hold and works as expected the quality is nice and the tear shaped foam brush is gentle on the sensitive under eye area that said , the price for this brush is beyond ridiculous i'm not even sure how long this brush will last , since most people do use concealer on a regular \( everyday for me \) basis , so to buy something so expensive , when there are similar , cheaper alternatives , is mind i was given a chance to try this product out , and while i do n't have anything negative to state about the brush itself , i ca n't even begin to understand where they came up with this price
5	reviewed by my wife i have several dermablend products the covercreme in several colors the liquid camo medium coverage foundation the intense powdercamo i got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup \( she has been doing character makeup for a small shakespeare troupe in our county \) it works amazingly ! this high coverage liquid foundation is smooth , easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very , very tiny amount it dispenses from a tube and gives a nice satiney finish i tested honey beige on the back of my hand \( see image attached the lightest color below my middle finger on the back of the hand \) it has an almost undetectable fragrance , and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin truly excellent product
5	i am very familiar with setting powder for years i have been buying nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href watts beauty natural loose mineral powder translucent finishing setting powder mineral veil eco friendly refill bag huge dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 watts beauty natural loose mineral powder translucent finishing setting powder mineral veil eco friendly refill bag huge a it is the only thing that will work but sometimes the company gets the colors mixed up meaning , sometimes they place the veil powder in with the setting powder so the colors are never the same i had to write them to get the correct shade since then i have not had any issues i use setting powder because i have the skin there is i can never find anything at the drugstores or stores that carry the light shade i need my routine , i wash my face with soap i then use an astringent on it i then use an oil free serum then i place a thin light oil free foundation on i let it sit for a few minutes then apply the setting powder after , i wait another few minutes and finish with a light pressed powder i then leave the house with the pressed powder and use it as needed through the night but am usually told my face is flawless it took me a long time to figure out what steps to take and what products for the price , this is a much better value the other one i use comes in a bag and you have to have your own container and powder puff i like that this is all together and also cheaper the other one cost more and you only get of the amount i used this for a week to make sure i loved it , i do ! i already use the parent company loreal so i will be buying this one from now on this is perfect for some many things but really great for fair skin and keeping your face from it gives it a matte look which i love ! it also looks natural , as if you have nothing on i am glad i found this i will be making the switch
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	my hot pink key west color to go with my other one , a great touch up for at home collection and of course , what woman does n't want a sexy neon pink to make every guy trip ! \?
5	this moisturizing cream is my new favorite beauty product i just glow after using this , i do n't know how else to explain it my face looks healthy and radiant and i notice such a difference in the way i look in pictures i included a makeup free , picture of myself to try to show off my skin my face feels so soft and so smooth , and my skin feels restored i feel like i'm writing a of here , but they 're true i have sensitive skin , occasionally dry , not oily if you 're like me , do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this i 've never used replenix before , but this has me searching for all of their skincare line i 'll be back to update on any other products that compliment this nicely i also love the way that this dispenses no wasted product here just push down on the cap inside , and the perfect amount to apply is right at your fingertips 5 stars , all around
5	i'm a huge fan of eye creams and this one is no exception it 's a little difficult when you use the pump , only because a lot comes out with each pump you definitely do n't need too much product i pump once and pat it around both areas around the eye and it leaves it feeling hydrated and smooth the smell is soft and light and the cream does n't irritate my eyes which has become a problem over the past few years i also noticed it is helping to diminish the dark circles too ! excellent eye cream and i love the fact that it 's organic !
5	i took the clamp off of this curling iron and i really like the results i get when i use it my hair is hard to curl so i need the option of high heat , which this model has i use the highest heat setting and my waves last for several days the barrel heats up really quickly and evenly and it 's the perfect size for creating loose waves in my below shoulder length hair this is a perfect hair styling tool and i'm so glad i discovered this brand i have a babyliss hair dryer and absolutely love it , so i wanted to purchase a curling iron from the same company my hair never burns and it slips off the barrel really easily despite the styling products i use i like everything about this curling iron the only thing negative i can say is that i wish it had an auto shut off feature , but hey , you ca n't have everything right \? the adjustable temperature is a feature i really need and using the highest setting gives me curls that last for several days however , i do use a good heat protectant \( living proof restore revitalizing spray or agadir argan oil serum \) so i get no damage whatsoever the 1 inch size is great for creating loose waves that i then brush through only once the curls immediately spring back into position and they loosen somewhat once i go outside into the humidity of the day \( i live in florida , where the humidity does ugly things to hair \) which causes them to droop slightly however , once this occurs , i get the perfect amount of wave \( not curl \) and i do n't even have to redo my hair on the 2nd or 3rd day this is a great curling iron and i highly recommend it for all hair types and lengths
1	im not saying that this doesnt work well , but it doesnt work well for me i am a 40 year old woman who still suffers from the occasionally bout of acne , and in addition to not being able to stand the smell , this stuff burns like crazy when its being applied maybe for someone younger with less sensitive skin , this will work better for me , its not a product ill continue to use
4	this foundation is suitable for normal , sensitive as well as dry skin types it matches my skin tone and suits me well instructions say to apply foundation with fingertips in a circular motion from the center of face outward it provides good coverage the skin feels smooth and creamy after application this liquid foundation hydrates the skin it did not create any reaction to my sensitive skin after applying
5	i ca n't believe how much i'm loving this product first off let me say i have acne prone , sensitive skin with eczema and have been in a near constant battle with my skin for over 20 years now it 's tough to find a product that is effective without nasty side effects and that i really like and find comfortable on my skin lately i 've been successful in finding some new to me products and this is one of them feels light and airy but does n't feel like like a cool water being spritz \( like a thermal water spray \) instead it has a substance to it \( but as i said is still light and airy \) and i hesitate to use the word film because that sounds negative but i do n't mean it that way it has a film like or slightly sticky to the touch texture if sprayed liberally over skin it sinks in quickly though and that goes away with it it is not bothersome or time consuming causes me no breakouts , redness or pink blotches , no itching or burning , no stinging to the eyes and has been gentle on my skin smells pleasant with a flowery and rose esque fragrance is an amazing makeup setter and even better at helping me apply my bb cream or foundation after applying all my moisturizer , serums , sunscreen etc and let that absorb i spray my face with this stuff several times \( maybe 4 which might be too much for some people but i like it \) and let it sit on my skin for 10 30 seconds as it absorbs but , before it 's fully absorbed and dried i then apply my bb cream \( or foundation concealer etc \) with my fingertips \( you can use a brush of course if you want \) and it blends sooo smoothly and really gives more of a flawless , hydrated , airbrushed look it is not oily looking at all but just perfectly blends my makeup and i ca n't believe how much better my makeup looks since i started using this to apply my bb cream i 've also used it to set makeup after fully finishing applying it and it does stay on and stay put longer the idea with the bb cream application is similar to a makeup sponge dipped in water i guess it does the same type of thing also very refreshing to just spray now and then over my makeup later in the day or on bare skin i ca n't imagine doing my makeup without this now and am so pleased with the results i 've wanted to try a floral water for a long time , this is my very first one and i'm sticking with it l o v e it ca n't recommend it enough
5	i'm not sure anything is going to save me from crow 's feet at this age and this level of sun exposure throughout my life , but i want to believe and this is a great product to give me hope ! the tube is quite generous for the price from some of the other reviews i got the feeling that they thought the cost was expensive , but very nice eye cream is quite dear and you only need a dot , massaged around and into the wrinkles the cream is velvety and just lovely it absorbs right away , no greasy look , no leaking back into your eyes and i wear a mask to sleep , so many of the creams do end up back in my eye this one , no problem i do n't think there is any scent , there is absolutely nothing to irritate your sensitive around the eye skin with in this cream la roche is a super company , too i love this cream and it gives me hope lol what more can you ask for \? !
5	i love this stuff ! i do n't wear a ton of makeup but i swim almost every day and use sunscreen until now , i actually had trouble getting the sunscreen off my face it would clog my pores when i got this , the sunscreen just melted off and it left me with clean , soft and fresh skin i'm trying to take care of my skin and not abuse it like i always did i use this with my clarisonic and my skin is perfect ! love it
4	a tiny bit goes a long way it 's very smooth and gentle on my sensitive skin it is not over drying and my skin feels great after using it i did not notice any heavy scents but my super sensitive eyes did feel slightly irritated as it got near a lot less that similar products but still
5	this stuff is great for thinning hair , but you need some hair for it to adhere to it 's keratin , which i believe is a protein that is part of the structure of hair and it looks very natural , if you choose the right color even a hairdresser could n't tell i was using it until she washed my hair it comes out easily with shampoo , but can last for a day or two if you do n't wash your hair it makes your hair look so much thicker and that is saying something my hair is so thin in the back that my scalp shows through , but with toppik , you ca n't tell even if someone was sitting behind you , like in church , i do n't think they would pick up on the fact that you are using it men , if your head is totally bald , you know , shiny , i do n't think this is for you , but if you are thinning and still have a fair amount of strands of hair left , this could work for you be sure to get the color closest to the rest of your hair i believe they even have grey i use either the dark brown or the light brown depending on the shade that i have my hair dyed also , it does n't come off on my pillow like the joan rivers junk , and the medium size can lasts pretty long it 's expensive , sort of , but worth it definitely cheaper than a wig or as soon as i open a new container , i order another one , just to make sure that i never run out the best price i have found is on this website sally 's beauty supply is much more expensive , as is the toppik website
5	dermatologists recommend a mineral sunscreen such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide the older generation sunscreens with zinc oxide used to leave a thick white paste on the skin , similar to the look of diaper cream obagi nu derm however has a thin , almost fluid consistency and just about disappears on the skin if you rub it in for about 10 seconds there is a very faint powder scent the special smooth zinc formula is called z , a trademark of this sunscreen is also great if you tend to have acne breakouts after wearing sunscreen , because zinc oxide is great at preventing acne according to dermatologist rebecca , its main beneficial properties relative to the skin include being an antioxidant , as well as being anti inflammatory and antimicrobial studies have suggested that zinc may reduce acne causing bacteria counts , and that it may also reduce sebum and oil production
4	i tested some of this self tanner on my arm it has been about an hour and i can only see where my skin has plumped from the moisturizer the color looks brighter where i applied the tanner i like the smell of the product , it has a much nicer smell than most self tanners since this is a gradual tanner , i most likely wo n't see too much change in color until it has been used for a week or two i am not a tanner , in fact , i burn quite easily and am prone to skin cancer this product does not have sunscreen , so if you go outdoors , you will still need that protection applied i do love the smell and how nicely it applies and how where it is applied , the skin looks better
5	great brand and great color !
5	product was as described
5	despite being an adult , i still have oily skin in the t zone if the weather is humid , my whole face can become rather oily i like this tint because it gives a velvety matte finish , even hours after application la roche posay is one of my favorite skin care lines , ever since discovering them in france so glad it 's finally here !
4	delicacy is closer to a light peach or pink peach shade with a very muted shimmer very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point
4	this setting powder is straightforward it 's used after foundation and blush bronzer to keep the makeup last long and to keep urban and dirt dust from getting absorbed i 've been using it in the winter and expect that it 'd work even better during the hot and humid months as it is , it 's kept my foundation looking good and meant less need for touchups throughout the day so far , it has n't caused any reactions or skin irritation
1	over priced sells good but not great product does n't hold up
5	this is a light foundation in a very liquid state application is easy a dropper mechanism dispenses desired amount of foundation to apply found the makeup non irritating generally , i choose a shade that is one of the lightest on the bliss color chart buff would seem perfect for me however , it appears an odd tone when dispensed , more light yellow orange it does blend in however added sunscreen of 20 is a bonus additional layers of foundation applied are not noticably heavy if you wear a concealer , you will still need to do so
5	i'm extremely partial to my smashbox studio skin 15 hour foundation and did n't think this could possibly measure up , but i have to say that i'm really impressed i wanted something a little more luminous to wear , at least on my t zone and cheek bone area now that winter is around the corner studio skin is great for a polished matte look in the summer but on dry skin \( which i only get during the winter months \) , it has a tendency to sit the skin , which also accentuates the pores i'm really pleased with the finish \( natural skin look \) and longevity i 've tried dozens of luminous finish foundations in the past 1 2 years and most of them make me look oily , shiny , sparkly and or have a very short lasting power this stays on me for nearly a full day without touch ups i like the sheer formula because i do n't like looking as though i'm wearing a face full of makeup though i do wish it were a little more heavily pigmented \( thankfully i'm having a good skin month but this really does n't cover very well \) i just ca n't bring myself to try and layer anything on my face it never looks natural imo and my skin hates me for it later i dab and then buff this on to my t zone and cheekbones using a round shaped brush , then i use my studio \( which is about a shade darker since it 's my summer color \) to frame my face and blend never heard of japonesque before but i'm really happy to have this foundation and will continue to purchase it has not made me break out in the slightest and seems to keep my skin normal \( with regards to not drying out my skin or making it too oily \) where i use it additionally , i appreciate that it is sunscreen free because it can be really difficult to find that in a foundation nowadays
5	this is amazing for sun burns and for itchiness love this product
5	best shampoo ever for dry hair my entire family uses it and loves the smell
1	this nail polish , although essie brand , is horrible quality i do n't know if it 's the manufacturer or the distributor , but it went on like paint thinner , no shine , chipped after a day , very flat i do not recommend
4	ignore the marketing and what you have is a well balanced product the cream has a so so fragrance , not bad , not good in my opinion the product goes on well due to thickness and definitely moisturizes without question , a few days of use made my face look a little better however , the nonsense of illuminating and shadows is absolute not to mention the instant 3d optical correctors come on folks stay away from all the flowery , almost , reviews it is a moisturizer that appears \( feels \) to out perform low to mid range products
4	the la roche posay anthelios 50 aox is a non comedogenic , silicone based sunscreen and antioxidant serum which uses tocopherol \( vit e \) as its antioxidant base the serum spreads very well and a small amount will cover a large area i could get a single pump to cover my entire face albeit rather thinly i 'd guess that a 1 to 1 5 pumps is probably average the serum goes on rather and is not really pleasant feeling to apply the greasy feel dissipated in a minute or so and left the skin feeling somewhat smoother \( not as smooth as applying a moisturizer , but similar \) with careful , i'm guessing this single vial would probably last two or maybe even three months \( assuming you are reapplying every two hours as directed while you 're exposed to uv rays \) there is no true scent associated to the serum other than a sort of faint and generic chemically smell when first applied it did n't bother me much and seemed to go away within a few minutes the serum also contains things like root and leaf extracts , both which are often used as and anti inflammatory type medicines the anthelios 50 aox is a decent sunscreen that goes on rather greasy , dries smoothly and does not have a noticeable scent afterwards the non comedogenic aspects are great , especially since many sunscreens seem so heavy and clogging however , there 's quite a few chemicals included as well as being silicone based , which is n't exactly eco friendly if you have sensitive skin , this serum has quite a few glycols in the ingredients , so you may want to test it out before using all over your face
4	essie is my favorite polish love all the different colors
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i wear sunscreen all the time regardless of the season or time of day this sunscreen is one of the more by me in comparison to other obagi sunscreen products \( and there are two more from the same brand but different skincare line \) first good point is the strength of the spf this product is spf 50 which is quite high the other advantage is that this product comes in tint when i apply this sunscreen on top of the moisturizer it provides both protection and coverage there is no need to use foundation because this sunscreen is tinted i have a very pale skin and a little bit of tint gives my face a nice color especially during winter time it totally replaces foundation because the tint can cover any skin imperfection bottle comes in a very generous size it is convenient to be kept in the bathroom or taken to the beach i personally find it too bulky to be carried in a purse great product , i highly recommend it
4	pretty color
5	i 'll admit , i was n't too sure about this when i first got it usually , a make up remover is n't so great on removing mascara and a toner is usually for after makeup removal , not along side of it so with a bit of trepidation i gave this a try , and i love it first , thermale 3 in 1 calming cleansing micellar water facial cleanser is fantastic for removing eye shadow , liner and mascara i use a primer and long wear liner with occasional waterproof mascara my eye make is put on to last for hours and is really hard to get off with regular cleaner this product makes even the hard to remove waterproof mascara so easy to remove ! ! ! it takes a little time because my makeup is black , but it cleans it all off quicker and more completely than any other makeup remover i have used added bonus , no greasy feeling afterwards like the other eye makeup removers i wash my face with cetaphil then using a clean cotton ball , i then wipe the rest of my face to remove any thing that may be left on and to tone the skin it feels amazing i am really stunned at how well this product works and feels so wonderful it is worth every penny !
5	this eye cream is great , especially for those with sensitive eyes virtually every other eye cream i 've tried makes my eyes tear and i ca n't use them this l'occitane cream does not it 's lightweight but still does a great job of moisturizing and keeping down the wrinkles i'm also sensitive to fragrance in cosmetics divine eyes has a very light and pleasant herbal scent that i notice when i first pump it out , but it 's undetectable on the face it has a pump to get it out of the bottle usually pumps are n't my favorites because they are one size fits all however i found that it was very easy to control the amount of lotion i got from the bottle this lotion has everything going for it effective , nice scent , easy to use great for sensitive eyes
4	have n't used it long but already notice improvements i do use it only once per day as i found that using it 2x day \( as suggested \) is overly drying for my skin
5	i 've been using cnd 's stickey base coat for about three years , ever since i first read about it in a beauty magazine it really does an excellent job of your nail polish down , and it makes my at home manicures last much longer than they ever did before i began using it the smell is a bit strong , but it dissipates pretty quickly , and it does n't add too much extra time to your manicure since it also dries quickly it 's a great product to try out if you struggle with peeling and chipping nail polish
5	this is a beautifully presented set of essential oils for your hair and scalp you get a nice box that contains twelve tiny \( 0 12 oz \) vials and an applicator you are meant to apply one vial to your hair every few days after a shampoo and towel dry the solution has a lovely smell , botanical and a bit sharp , perhaps rosemary \? some essential oils known to promote hair health are rosemary , cedarwood and sage this box of 12 vials should last one month it 's suggested you 'll notice a difference in hair thickness and volume in three months so far i enjoy the smell and feel of the oils but it 's too early to tell if this has made a difference \( though the effects of these oils is well known and i expect good results \) will update this set is rather expensive and would make a terrific gift the budget conscious , though , might well be able to replicate the solution for much less when this box arrived and i first opened it the vials were scattered all over the inside of the box the distributor might consider a packaging insert that would secure them
5	this is a great summer polish for toes and fingers , but i mostly wear it on my toes it 's a great shade of pink that does n't clash with anything else you might be wearing and essie pretty much wo n't chip \( at least on your toes \) for at least a week great great color !
3	i tried this for a full week , using it every day , and i really did n't see a difference in the way it made my make up stay on i wear make up everyday , and have used several other brands , but i have to say that for the price of this , i do n't think i would buy it , because there are less expensive ones out there , that have the same results however , it did make the skin on my face a little smoother
5	i received a small sample of this mustela hydra facial cream in a gift , and i tried it on myself and absolutely loved it ! it is a really light , non greasy lotion and i feel confident using it on my baby i enjoy the clean , fresh scent , it 's a bit stronger than i was expecting but very pleasant i was thankful that this facial cream is hypoallergenic , and 86 of the ingredients are from natural origin also , it states on the box that mustela parabens , phthalates or phenoxyethanol it works instantly , providing moisturize and relief my toddler scratched my baby 's face accidently with a toy , and a dab of this cream healed it quickly love !
5	another wonderful product from la roche posay goes on light and smooth , perfect to apply after a shower and prior to makeup i have always loved la roche , it used to only be available from dermatologists but now you can buy the product everywhere i love the uv protection as well as it is non greasy \( as most uv products are \) might be a little over priced , but most la roche is , then again you do get what you pay for a little goes a long way with this tube , will last a few months
4	dermablend is amazing it covers everything up easily and does not sweat off you have yo use soap to get it off and then it comes off easily
5	great price arrived on time works as advertised
5	i do n't ever expect these kinds of products to work , but they 're fun to try this one surprised me though i have some crepey skin above one eyelid , and after using this for about a week , it definitely began to look plumper and smoother \( ! ! \) it 's just a temporary effect , though when i was unable to use the product for a while , the old appearance came back so it 's going to be an ongoing investment to enjoy the results but at least there are results to enjoy ! the tube does seem to be lasting for a long time , at least , even though it 's pretty expensive
4	i know i need to use a daily sunscreen , but i do n't like heavy or oily products on my face coola white tea is light and absorbs like a moisturizer while offering more sun protection than my usual daily routine coola protects my face without leaving my skin greasy it allows my makeup to go on smoothly i also like the white tea scent it 's lightly floral and does n't stick around leaving me smelling like sunscreen the fact that it 's spf 50 is a huge bonus this sunscreen does n't cause breakouts , either it 's a definite must have for my beach bag
5	this is a great product creamy without being greasy , easy to apply , no scent that i could detect and it really seems to soften the rough edges of my feet ! it 's more like a lotion than a gel so it 's easy to apply maybe it 's my imagination , but my feet felt better immediately i'm hard on feet i walk a lot i work out and take exercise i wear but always have trouble getting a good fit so i need to use something it otherwise day so far this cream is even better than some products i 've been using designed for feet , as well as the general skin creams and gels that were recommended by others so glad i got to try this in vine i would n't have discovered it otherwise
5	i love love love the way this smells and use it every single day my skin is softer and smooth i will definitely recommend
5	great summer color new nail polish dries so much better very happy with color it was a risk online i love all things hot pink and this is true to family yipppee
4	is a misleading label i assumed it was basically a fancy name for , which is probably fairly accurate , but it 's much stronger than i 'd expect i normally get my body sprays from places like bath body works , and am used to using multiple sprays to get a strong , pleasant scent that fades quickly this fragrant water requires 1 spray and lasts at least longer \( i have not done any scientific testing here , so i error on the side of caution in this estimate \) i like the scent well enough it has a very perfumy smell , i e it smells nice , but i can not identify any real smells in it i wish they offered it in different scents it comes in a nice bottle \( i really liked the lid \) i would call this a perfume rather than
5	this is perhaps my favorite opi polish it is made up of dots all over a base coat which is mostly clear and like most of opi sparkly polishes it can be worn over any other polish \( as a topcoat \) or several coats all on it 's on i use it all over the place mix it with other sparkly polishes or over a product but however you use it you will love it and i guarantee that just do n't buy to many i'm coming back for more ! ! ! !
5	my skin is baby soft after every use ! once a week or every 4 5 days is good enough
4	great mask for 30 skin it moisturizes your skin from within and makes the surface more toned and even
5	excellent moisturize and it helps me a lot
5	if you like cotton candy pnk ! this is for you my favorite pink essie nail polish of all time !
5	i have been using this stuff for almost 2 years i know it has made a huge difference in my skin i get many compliments on my skin and i am 58 years old my hairdresser said i have the skin of a 25 year old it has minimal lines , no pores , smooth and tight i would highly recommend this serum with that said , i also lead a very clean lifestyle and have for many years i'm sure this helps with the condition of my skin
5	have been using the davines momo conditioner in conjunction with the momo shampoo for several years now they choose very pretty colors in their entire line i have colored hair and the momo works the best for me a little bit of the shampoo goes a long way creating a nice lather and easy to rinse out my hair is thick and long and well to the davines line the momo conditioner is equally as great , put in thru your hair and only a little on your scalp i personally find my hair weighing to heavy if i have too much conditioner sitting for too long in my scalp area found this at the hair salon that i frequent , happy and thrilled to find it on amazon its a great line recommend it for anyone seeking a really wonderful shampoo and conditioner that delivers perfect results
5	i have a very hard time finding night creams that do n't give me acne , but this product is great ! feels very thick at first , but absorbs well and leaves skin feeling very smooth
5	perfect for the circles underneath my eyes and small blemishes i use a very similar concealer made by mac for the same thing dermablends glides on smooth and is easy to blend it gives light to medium coverage when blended with a brush the color seems too light for my skin , but it 's perfect for under the eye a make up artist had told me to go light to give your face some highlights and to not get the same color that you would use for the rest of your face i am normally around but suits my just fine
5	i have barber certified thick hair , at short to medium length i only need about a double pea sized around of this pomade for a great finish that pays no attention to the windows being rolled down at speed this is clearly real clay , and as some have said out of the jar it smells medicine strong , sort of a musky green tea powder smell this is not at all unpleasant , and once on the hair it 's barely even noticed if you have short to medium hair , and you either just need a good hold or a matte finish , this product is simply the best overall i ca n't speak highly enough of the baxter products i 've tried their pomades are perfect including a hard water formula if that 's a concern the deoderant i got is the exact scent i 've searched for my whole life my travel shave brush is a perfect , compact solution when i need a full shave on the go if this line continues to demonstrate this level of quality i 'll be getting more items in the future
5	daughter was thrilled i could order this for her
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	this is very convenient color correcting pen for the under eye one can use it as a concealer of dark circles it can be also used a a part of the makeup application prior to applying foundation the most similar to this one i used in a past is ysl brand which is much more expensive and gives no better results that this product i absolutely love the brush on the tip of the pen it is not made of natural fibers , but fibers are so soft it feels delightful when it touches the skin one can easily control how much product to use during the application the opposite tip of the pen allows for tint to come towards the brush so it can be applied on the skin pen is very thin and it can be easily stored in a cosmetic bag or a purse tin is not too dark course ever person has a different skin tone so it may be tricky to know which shade one can use but if you are using it under foundation , it really does not matter it will only enhance and moisturize under eye area
5	i purchased for the first time and love it just a little bit works i will being purchasing this item again ! it really did make my hair feel nourished
5	the color is a beautiful dark pink berry color , not a dark color but for pinks , considered dark the formula is great and super easy to work with and very shiny i can decide if this polish is a creme or jelly so ill go with crelly
5	i'm very impressed with this cream , i have absolutely obnoxious dry skin that seldom responds well to products that seem to work well for others my last moisturizer felt great and did the job but caused milia to form milia is really hard to get rid of once it 's there this cream , on the other hand , does n't have any ingredients to cause this problem , and that 's the difference between cheap moisturizers and those that are good quality this cream is deeply hydrating without any trace of greasiness it sinks entirely into the skin without leaving any residue on the surface while my skin is ultra dry , i have a t zone that sometimes gets oily during the day and this cream does n't cause problems with that in fact , it seems to be less oily than usual , which is a wonderful surprise my skin looks radiant , moist , and healthy without any additional shine which i do n't care for this cream is very light \( almost like a type texture \) and only a small amount is needed it has a light fragrance that dissipates quickly it works well under makeup , keeping it fresh throughout the day i'm using it with the truffle serum , these two products really complement each other and my skin looks better than it has in years i love how my skin looks and feels , and the truffle products from skin co are a joy to use very highly recommended , especially for mature skin that 's dry like mine
4	it works the way it claims , making makeup last longer and helping it look nice the downside is that it seems like a tube wo n't last long , so it could get expensive \( but maybe this would be nice to use for occasions when you really need to look particularly good \) i get a bit of irritation from it as well , so i do n't think i 'd want it on my skin every day , and it does n't have spf so you 're giving up sun protection \( or having to use something separately , perhaps invest in a sun hat so you 're not a bunch of different chemicals on your face \? \) on the whole it does its job , but i think for most people it 'd end up being impractical as a daily use item
5	a true fushia which is really hard to find very nice formular coverage is good and the color is wow !
4	if you 've never tried jane iredale products you should give them a try i 've yet to try one of her cosmetics i have n't liked this lip balm in buff color is really terrific and i am now use it at night to moisturize as well as during the day , i like to use it during the day with a nude lip liner because it adds just the slightest color to my lips and makes them stand out yet not look overdone for this reason it is nice if you just are going out for the day and want a natural look for your lips if however , you 're looking for something that would really add more color you may want to try one of her other lip color products this one works more like a gloss recommended i'm obviously a big fan my only critique is that it does n't moisturize as well as i 'd like a simple almost works better but this obviously looks better
2	highly by dermatologists and doctors for its protection i was n't that impressed it left a slight residue \( besides being greasy \) to the skin made your skin look slightly gray and if hot outside it seemed to melt into the creases in your elbow area and turn white again not something i would recommend
3	essie always comes out with the best colors and this was no exception the only thing i did not like about this nail polish is that you have to paint your nails white before you use this color or else it looks awful
5	good , nice color
5	i like this thick goop a lot it 's very gentle , yet leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed one note it takes some effort to rinse off , so i recommend using it in the shower to ensure that it does n't leave any residue
5	great price and product !
5	the best smelling and prettiest soap out there wonderful , but expensive good for gift giving
4	i 've always been very pleased with bliss products , and this a bright face kit is no exception bliss products smell and feel great on my skin and have a really fresh feel first of all , the face wash is an excellent product for many skin types it rinses cleanly , is lightweight , and leaves a fresh scent unlike some cleansers , there is no residue left after rinsing , and it could be used both morning and night the triple oxygen day cream is a great product , as well lightweight and fresh , it goes on nicely under makeup i wish that a night cream would have been included instead , but the triple oxygen day cream is still an excellent product and is a nice addition to my morning skin regimen both the cleanser and the day cream are full size , so this is a good value however , i did n't have as much luck with the that 's incredi peel i felt that it was too harsh for my skin , and i do n't even have overly sensitive skin my face felt a little irritated , but this was quickly remedied by my night cream also , there were 5 peels i used them every other night instead of the recommended daily application , and i think this was just as effective i feel like i could evaluate the peels more effectively if they had been paired with a night cream all in all , i'm pleased with the results and pleased with how my skin looks and feels if you have never tried bliss products before , this is a good set to get you started
3	i received the life palette moment in ice bunny i am a michelle phan fan , but i am finding as i test various em products that the quality of her makeup does not live up to her reputation for the higher price points , it should be better quality this set pretty much followed that same line i am going to break it down into the separate components of the set palette the palette is a little on the heavy side for it 's size , but that is due to the magnetic feature all of the colors in this palette can be removed and replaced i love this feature ! the only problem is that you will probably have to replace them with more em products due to the size and shape of the pans i also like that you can have your eyeshadow , blush and lip gloss all in one palette that is convenient for traveling the brush this comes with a small dual ended brush i personally did not like this brush i feel like the blush eyeshadow end is too fluffy for eyeshadow and too small for blush i am spoiled by my urban decay brushes and i ended up using them for the eyeshadow i attempted to use the em brush for blush , but quickly switched to a small kabuki brush i did use the small flat end for the lip gloss in the palette because i did n't want to ruin one of my brushes it worked fine the brush also does not fit inside the palette which is a pain the eyeshadow i love a few of the eyeshadow colors they are good for a day or night look i recommend using snow day on the inner eye \( a really pretty shimmery bronze \) , bundle up on the outer eye , ice bunny to highlight the corners and under the brow and a dash of winter or black pumps to darken the outer corner of the eye i loved this look on my eye unfortunately , without primer it did n't last very long i wore this look along with an urban decay 24 7 eyeliner and l'oreal mascara to dinner with friends when i arrived home 2 hours later there was no eyeshadow left it had all faded and all i was wearing was eyeliner and mascara definitely use primer to make this eyeshadow stick around the blush the blush is pretty and i think i would like it if i had different coloring however , this color does not show up on my skin at all \( i am pale with a lot of red tones \) the lip gloss the lip gloss will make your lips shiny and super glossy , but so will vaseline and that is what it feels like the lip glosses are extremely thick and sticky and feel really gross on your lips both of the colors in the ice bunny palette came up clear on my lips it just looked like i had a thick layer of clear gloss on i do n't like the lip product and probably would n't use it unless i had to overall , i would not recommend this eye palette there are much better makeup products that you could buy for the current price of 35 i hope that michelle phan starts making quality makeup that she would actually use soon
4	fresh , natural looking color goes on easily and lasts for the day i would recommend
5	great color ! goes on smooth , dries quickly and chips much less than similar brands !
4	i always seem to have issues with my makeup staying on a busy day i have tried other setting sprays , but i have not found one that i really liked i like bliss products in general and i feel like this lives up to the name it did n't seem at all sticky or tacky which was my main concern it really feels a bit refreshing i feel like my makeup lasted several hours longer than normal
5	good , nice color
5	this stuff is amazing ! it works just as advertised ! a small bit is plenty enough to help tame my frizzy mane i love wearing my hair in a ponytail or bun , and always is hairs standing up on end everywhere hair spray never does does trick , and hair gel just makes my hair look like i just sprayed a coating of shellac on my head a small dollop of wow evenly distributed on my head after putting it up keeps my hairs down all day long it slides on smoothly and no greasy reside or look left behind the only question i have is if it can be used with flat irons \? there is no mention of it anywhere
4	this is a modest portion of body lotion which touts a variety of beneficial natural ingredients i'm rating it based on usability and effectiveness as well as consider value first , i will address effectiveness and say that i found this to be a better than average cream for dry , scaly skin \( especially hands \) it softened well and made my hands feel smooth for a longer period of time than other consumer grade lotions like lubriderm it did n't function as well as some prescription lotions , but it is more accessible in terms of usability , it does have a unique scent an almost clinical one which is n't really medicinal , but has the smell of chemicals or unusual flowers with a not entirely pleasant smell the scent is better than some overly perfume like lotions , but it still is n't great the texture is thick and creamy and it spreads well , though it does initially leave a bit of a tacky feeling , but absorbs after about 15 minutes and no longer feels tacky it 's an effective lotion and you can use it in smaller amounts so the higher price tag is n't such a big deal , but it still is a factor in considering the product 's value if you need to use it on more of your body than just your hands
5	like i said i like the white gold or silver color best i am what they call a summer in color so white gold or platinum is my color choice
2	i love this color but had problems with even coverage maybe an off day for me the polish has specks with a beautiful shimmer and dark green undertones will try again and see how it works second time around
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	perfect as it should be good product not much to say about it , i would recommend to a friend !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	well i wanted to wear the product before reviewing not sure about waterproof 100 i work 12 hr shifts and put this on at 6 and my eye lids were smudged and product was all over crease around great eye liner but does n't stay put all day
5	beautiful and good price
4	i 've been using this with my clarisonic and it gets my dry , acne prone skin very clean and without leaving a noticeable residue behind i appreciate that it leaves my skin feeling naked without stripping it of needed oils the fragrance is also soft and not overpowering or noxious , which i appreciate as sometimes drugstore cleansers can be too potent smelling to my nose the only thing i would say is that if i am wearing eye makeup i do feel i need to use a dedicated eye makeup remover i can eventually get it off with this cleanser but it dose seem to require more time and elbow grease to do so and i sometimes find a few eye lashes \( my own not \) fall off in the process but that is n't unique to this cleanser , i generally find i prefer a dedicated eye makeup remover would recommend for skin types like mine
5	love the color , perfect for summer and keeping it professional and neutral for work !
5	this highlighter leaves a beautiful glo to my skin i use it on my cheek bones , around my eye , down my nose and on my bow it 's perfection it blends beautifully and does n't have any fallout
5	i usually use loose powder but this compact is really nice the powder goes on smoothly with even color on my face it comes with a sponge applicator and has a cover that you can see in the picture that goes between the powder and the sponge when you are n't using it it left my face feeling fresh and clean , not oily overall , i was impressed
3	the color looks good
4	this is a lot like other tanning lotions there is the slight chemical smell , and you must make sure to exfoliate well before applying the lotion , or you will end up with different shades of tan in the rough skin areas it is important to note that unlike most tanners this one has a slight green color when you rub it on your skin i slept with it on , and wore clothes over it to bed , so the color did n't rub off on to the sheets i washed it off in the morning , and the green disappeared it is not as strong as some other tanners , the change in color after one coat is slight , but after a couple applications the color is significant
4	this is my long time preferred moisturizer it feels great on with a light but pleasing scent this is a bit heavier than other moisturizers so i find it good for winter months here in wi it is important to know this is a sample size , the same one vichy gives as a gift with purchase from time to time there is enough here to decide if you like it or not , maybe a few days worth i prefer to buy this in the regular size since it lasts longer this mini is nice for your purse or gym bag
5	japonesque is known for its line of high quality make up tools like brushes with this new line of foundation and colors , i see they are approaching this market very carefully this primer is easy to apply , seems to be mineral based it says on very nicely and does n't clog the pores it allows the skin to breath while does n't get oil up too easily and the colors stay on long and nice it is not irritating the primer comes in several different shades it 's a decent size apply sparingly it lasts all day also easy removal with any makeup removal cleanser highly recommended
4	a primer with a sunscreen in it sounds very nice i have tried quite a few primers , but this is the first one i have used that comes out looking white , like a regular lotion it is thick enough to spread over the face with your fingers , whereas others i have to use a brush application to apply as they are more of a gel liquid this is a very smooth , slick feeling primer , and i do feel it fills in those pesky pores in my face and makes my skin look better and smoother it does leave the slightest white tint from the sunscreen , but with either powder or liquid foundation , that was covered over it has no offending odor to it either but yes , that cap they decided to put on it who 's idea was that \? mine does n't seem to cause a mess like others have experienced , but the primer does not come out as easy as it should not a deal breaker in my book , but it wins no points i prefer this primer over my several smashbox ones that do n't seem to leave my face looking smoother i would place this on the same level as a new lancome primer i have that also fills in pores nicely , without irritation still , for the summer and when i am outside , i would choose a primer that has some sunscreen in it
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	great gentle scrub smells great and the texture is smooth and nice this does n't strip your face raw i use this daily , its just a nice gentle scrub my face and neck are smooth and non irritated from this product i'm 53 and i love anything from mario badescu
2	every time i use this base coat , my cnd polish wears off too quickly too bad since i like the large round bottle and other cnd products have been great maybe its not meant to be used with cnd vinylux weekly polish \?
4	the first thing noticeable is the basic , bare bones packaging something that should become standard practice however , if you find this in the store , the packaging may be different i 've noticed some products from amazon come in basic packaging yet their counterparts at the local store are bigger \( to you in with branding and marketing \) and wrapped in hard to cut plastic the plastic container me \( you can see it in the close up photos of the product \) i thought it might have some hidden object after a little research \( the box did n't explain it \) , i found out the side arms are for other jouer products for easier storage this is the first jouer product i 've tried , so there are n't any others to test the feature it opens like any other flip top makeup product one side has the pinkish rose blush and the other has a mirror it does n't come with a brush , but most blush products do n't since it typically requires a big brush my face is pale and my skin is mixed some places are a little oily \( not the cheekbones \) , some dry and some normal cheekbones are n't oily the color worked blended nicely with my complexion , and brown hair with blonde highlights a base amount gives it a gentle pinkish look adding more darkens the color , something i 'd do for evening events or going someplace dark the lightweight blush looks and feels soft it 's not harsh , oily or sparkly that 's all i can ask for as long as the color is right i can only speak for my skin type as i'm no makeup pro \( one plus for working in a home office limits makeup use \) the price \( 24 \) is higher than people who shop for makeup at super stores like target and walmart the price is competitive with makeup in department stores some are higher and some about the same one brand 's lowest price was 30 and it came with the small blush brush two other brands were 26 and 30 did n't find many for 24 or less unless they 're the kind of brands you find in super stores and grocery stores i hope you found this review helpful and show it with a quick click of yes if you have questions , please comment so i can update the review with answers to your questions
5	works great !
5	i love essie because of it 's staying power it lasts for more than one week and this color was rockin' i received many compliments on the color
4	great color but the brush is very tinny the color is beautiful but is does not last at all
5	love cnd polish this color is a beautiful shade of orange and lasts for weeks great spring color super fast shipping
1	i cant tell if it does anything to my hair what a waste of money i put a little bit on and all i got is like my hair were dirty
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
5	this is a wonderful , thick balm cream that provides excellent soothing on shaved skin it is designed to be used after shaving and its perfect for that but it can be used in other ways as well ive been my ankle lately due to a slight and the sports tape irritated my skin after 8 to 12 hours so , i applied a little of this balm cream to the area just before putting on the tape and easily went 18 hours without the slightest irritation its clearly evident that the soothing ingredients truly work the balm cream also has a light , clean , bright scent that disappears almost immediately its not overwhelmingly masculine , so could even be considered unisex the ingredients are aqua water dimethicone glycerin zea mays starch corn starch isohexadecane sorbitan stearate c13 14 isoparaffin 2 , 6 dimethyl 7 2 stearyl alcohol ammonium polyacryldimethyltauramide ammonium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate poloxamer 338 disodium edta sucrose cocoate caprylyl glycol laureth 7 eperua falcata bark extract dextrin lactic acid polyacrylamide if i understand correctly , its the eperua falcata bark extract \( the fourth ingredient from the last \) that has the most significant soothing properties and im not the only one to notice this according to a rosacea support group , eperua falcata bark extract rich in , this natural active reduces skin hyper and protects against inflammation i could n't find a lot of scientific studies , but this soothing after shave balm cream really soothes
5	i had ordered the shellac negligee but did not receive the order i noticed that it had been shipped , but somehow got lost in the mail when i contacted the shipper , i was assured that i would receive a replacement immediately , and i did there was no hassle , nothing , just a new shipment i am so happy to have done business with this company thank you now on the note about the shellac it is easy to use and stays put for three to four weeks it 's easy to apply and actually easy to take off with some acetone
2	this was way expensive and does n't really do anything for me in any way my skin seems to break out when using it more than when i use something else and the scent is a bit too strong as well basically , it 's only a mediocre cleanser with no benefit to the skin i regret my purchase and feel i wasted my money i have since relegated this to use as hand soap by my hand soap jars with it so as not to waste it the bottle should last me several years when used this way
5	amazing color ! ! ! !
3	this product is n't quite what i thought it would be it 's best to go online and google shellac nail swatches there 's a pinterest board that has tons of swatches to look at even then , it 's hard to match something you see on a computer to the actual color it 's a little too beige for me but i 'll still use it
5	all my life people \( aka my mom \) would tell me i need to wear sunscreen daily and while i ca n't argue with that advice i could never seem to get behind it because i really did n't want to smell sunscreen unless i was laying on the beach but this product completely changed by perspective it does not smell like sunscreen at all it applies nicely to my face and i wear it everyday under my foundation i am a true believer of supergoop and will be using their products from now on !
5	i love the oribe bright blonde radiance spray i 've been using it twice a week for about 8 weeks and i did n't have brassiness between colors i know some complained about dryness , but i did n't have that experience i highly recommend this for use between colors
5	i am pale with cool tones it has always been hard for me to find a shade that works without making me look clownish this is an excellent blush shade \( petal pink \) for light complexions it is enough of a shade to bring out my cheekbones without looking obvious or overdone i used a makeup sponge since this does not come with an applicator lasted all day and i still looked good in the evening packaging is very nice and this did not open in my purse on its own many have ! very sleek well made container super happy with the product and the shade
5	this is a great color ! it is brownish grey , beautiful and unique i would n't say that it is for everyone , but i love it , especially for fall !
4	i really like this nail polish all essie colors are amazing this one lasted a long time however , when i purchased it , i thought it was a dark pink it goes on a very dark red i love the color , but it was not what i was looking for if you are looking for a dark pink , do n't choose this one if you are looking for a burgandy , i definitely recommend it !
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	this wound up being exactly what i needed during my trip to my skin got so dry and this came to my rescue i liked that there was no scent , so it did n't interfere with my allergies it went on smooth and into my skin so easily it did not leave my skin greasy , either just soft and smooth , getting rid of all the high altitude dry i only got a tiny sample , which lasted me about a week but over that week , my skin was soft and smooth , just like we want it to be also , on the plus side , i got ! do n't know if that was because of this lotion but it did n't hurt
4	it 's a great set of grooming tools expensive , but of a fantastic quality i have an issue with it being called manicure set , because it does n't have all the tools to do a manicure nail clippers and a nail file are not enough and certainly you ca n't trim your nails with tweezers but overall i ca n't really complain much , after receiving this set for free to review the nail clippers take a bit of time to figure out , but all three tools are well made and work great the case they come with is a gorgeous red leather thing probably a good gift for a man who has expensive taste
3	i ordered this product because of some irregularities on my face and discoloration near my eyes i do n't normally use much makeup , so i wanted a light textured , natural looking product this product feels a bit heavy and goes on a bit less smoothly than other products i 've used i used my finger to fix that and it looked better i am more used to a cream with a more liquid texture as a concealer the dermablend product works very well , and though it has a rather odd fragrance , it disappears pretty soon after the product is applied , so fragrance may not be a problem for those who are sensitive the color was a bit darker than i expected but it blends fine with my skin tone anyway the product comes in a small , easily container , and the one i received looked fresh and appealing all told , this is a good product recommended to those who are happy with a drier , more less creamy texture
4	overall it 's an excellent tool it doesnt work so well on thicker hair but my hair is pretty fine and it makes it really easy to style my hair the temperature controls are good and i like the little travel case it comes in and the auto shut off feature it is a little awkward to use and i did n't get great results but with practice , and watching a lot of the tutorial videos , im getting a lot better
3	some years ago , i read an article \( where \? \) written by an concerned about the state of his elderly feet in order to stress the importance of inspection and care of their cracked heels and toes , he would massage their feet with cream during their appointment while self care at home good heavens , these people must 've loved this ! i never took up the foot massage routine in my own medical practice , but the notion true enough as my own feet aged that i took up the nightly practice of cream application to feet which also doubled as a final lotion treatment to hands as well always seeking better , products for skin care , i jumped at the chance to try and review this ahava tea tree oil foot cream in terms of ease of application over a rough and complex surface , this gets five stars top notch rating the cream is rich with excellent with respect to tea tree oil benefits , a quick check on pubmed that not only has anti action against both bacteria and fungus , it also when applied with stops growth in the tissue of as this is way down the list of ingredients in this cream , and there 's no added of course , i'm not sure how much anti anything one gets out of this product finally the smell this is not your mother 's but actually your grandmother 's scent , and only if that grandma was born around the turn of the last century think aunt at the family holiday gathering when you were a kid and she 'd hug you tightly to her ample what was ahava thinking \? it still would be okay if only relegated to the feet all the way down there , but of course it 's clinging to the hands as well , and so silly to wash hands post feet only to re cream the hands with a fragrance free choice wo n't buy it again but will on to use it up and the feet will be the better for it
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	this is my favorite shampoo very mild cleanses and rinses well keeps my hair very healthy
4	i am familiar with salt scrubs and use them several times a week to improve the appearance of my skin i find that salt scrubs are wonderful for a detox experience if in a warm bath i really enjoy the rituals of salt scrub because of the consistency it stays on my skin and i do not feel that i waste any of the salt it is easier to apply it if i use step one as suggested this allows the scrub to stay on my skin longer and exfoliate in a powerful way i enjoy the scent and smell of the eucalyptus i do not find it to smell unpleasant or unnatural this scrub is a step above other scrubs i have used i would order again at this point and recommend with a month of use i still have a significant amount of scrub left and like the overall size of the tub
5	i 've tried many vitamin c serums but this one is the best while the clear serum comes in a glass bottle with enclosed dropper , i 've been using my finger tips against the bottle 's mouth and rub the serum directly on my skin , focusing on the corner of my eyes and above my lip this serum does not burn the skin at all , or dry it in any way like other serums tend to it also dries fast , so that you can apply moisturizer , sunblock or other creams over it after a week one notices a softer skin texture after daily use i detect a faint smell of green apple , although no fragrance is listed
4	i like the way after i use this product my skin feels so very soft and clean i this product to everyone
5	exc purchase
5	this is truly the top of the line shaving cream my husband said it 's this best shave he has ever had and he loves it ! his face was so super smooth when he was done he said he did n't feel a bit of irritation like he usually does after shaving he did mention that this bottle probably would n't last as long for someone who has a beard it is a true cream and does not lather so you need more of it to get a full shave due to the price of this shave cream it wo n't be something we will buy regularly but i will definitely be sticking a bottle of this in my husband 's stocking this year !
5	great
5	i love this nail polish ! i apply one layer on top of a neutral color for a subtle but ever so fun sparkly effect
1	received a can that was half full and the cap was not sealed on the product very disappointed and it 's an item that cannot be returned
5	i was quite happy to receive this review product i have been looking for something like this for a while when i first opened this and felt it i was impressed it did not have a strong smell , i was glad and it was not to soft or too hard it was quite easy to apply to my face and was n't all over the place like some i have had it blended quite nicely and left my skin feeling softer than it did before i did not have any reactions to it which is a big plus for me , it gave me just the right amount of color that i wanted , not too outstanding but rather like it was always there , which was nice i did n't say anything about using a new product to friends and family but they all noticed how nice my face looked and asked me what i did , should i tell them \? of course i did so far i really like this product i did n't have to put it on again during the day , nor touch it up maybe some will , but i did n't this has not caused any allergies for me which again is a big plus this may be different for others i suppose depending on how much you want to use so , i'm glad to recommend it to you i really do like it and hope you will as well
5	having south asian hair which is a bit thick and stubborn the thermal styling brush came as a blessing typical straightening technique which i have used for a long time is hair sprays \( tend to give me headaches \) and was using some styling oils a few years back all of these are messy , time consuming , but with this i can style my hair any way i want few other things never got my hair stuck in this even ones very smooth gliding bit heavier than others that have used , but more versatile than a simple hair curler very well built and very safe
3	the color is a fun , bright summer color neon without being ridiculous however , it was very thick and not smooth it was difficult to put on smoothly it also took three coats and dries matte i put a top coat on so its shiny anyway it 's ok , not great
5	i'm wearing it now since halloween is close , it 's a great color , i also add a little glitter to 1 nail so far just to see it would look i love it
5	the grand daughter swears by this stuff she has one area of her lower chin that is prone to acne outbreaks and this stick helps her cover it completely she does n't use anything else and the tones are true to color so order according to your own skin tone she only has to apply once in the morning with maybe a late afternoon touch up she gives it five stars
5	this was part of a nail polish gift package for my sister and she loved it great color ! excellent service too very fast shipping and appropriate packaging
4	my wife likes the vichy aqualia thermal hydrating lotion which is actually a sunscreen and a moisturizer according to her she likes that it is a moisturizer and a sunscreen 2 in 1 product but wished that it was a lighter texture she is however , more concern with any reactions to her skin as she has mild eczema and this lotion does not seem to have any adverse reaction good product for people with sensitive skin
5	this is a nice color and it wears well
5	i love nuxe products , and their nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nuxe huile prodigieuse multi purpose dry oil 1 6 fl oz dp b000bo52te ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 nuxe huile prodigieuse multi purpose dry oil , 1 6 fl oz a nbsp is one of my all time favorite beauty products , one that i 've re purchased and also given as gifts to friends this new mask is such a nice treat , and each time i 've used it , it has toned down the redness that my skin is prone to and made my skin really soft the rolling wheel that you apply this with works smoothly , and helps distribute evenly across your face , neck , and decolletage it 's nice to not have to wash your hands again , too , after applying this ! long term , i hope that the roller continues to work well , and that it does n't become clogged up i 'll update my review if it does i have sensitive skin that out easily if a product is too harsh , but this is really gentle and soothing i 've actually been using it at night \( which the instructions say you can do \) as a sleeping mask , and i 've pretty really impressed by how i wake up with an even complexion i'm not sure if the science behind the saffron flower and bougainvillea cell is really legitimate \( i tried looking this product up on paula begoun 's beautypedia site and it , and could n't find any information about it \) , but what i do know is that the redness that i usually always have around my nose and mouth is gone after using this it 's an excellent product in my book !
5	this is a gorgeous pastel pink color ! the only down fall to this color is it required 3 coats to get an even application other than that , this color is gorgeous and perfect for when you 're not sure what color to paint your nails !
5	when i saw the product name i thought this was traditional oil cleansing where an oil or oil blend only is applied to a dry face to cleanse this product is a combination of oils and ingredients which is put onto wet skin upon combining with water it turns into a low suds emulsion cleansing solution it is rinsed off with water then a layer of oil is left clinging to the skin which is a layer of moisturizer this has a mild scent which i cannot identify which surprised me as to me l'occitane is known for very strong fragrance levels i am fine with the scent as when i add a face lotion with spf that has a scent and everything else i use is another layer of scent \( facial lotions , body lotions , hair styling product , hair spray , anti perspirant \) although this was not what i assumed i like it very much i have sensitive skin with rosacea \( on prescription medication and an a food plan \) i rate this 5 stars i love it
5	i have thick short hair thats not easy to manage , as its turning grey the dryness is getting worse so i 've been looking for a product that softens while keeping it manageable , chi silk infusion is easy to apply and works keeping my hair soft and easy to manage , it smells good too with a clean mild scent i always add to my hair right after washing but have to my dry hair still getting good results
4	this leave in conditioner is extremely thick , the texture coats my hair like a lotion it does n't weigh my hair down and tames my fly aways the smell is pleasant and i keep reaching for it after every shower it 's a keeper !
3	this is clearly a solid product however , products of this type work differently for different people the bottle is a cool design and the product has a decent sweet smell a single pump of the product is more than enough for each use and the consistency of the product is easy to work with the product is a great moisturizer but we \( house of two home using the product \) have not seen a brightening effect
5	one of my absolute favorites i only buy essie and this is definitely in my top 5 i wore this on my nails and toes for my wedding day perfect off white color with a hint of shimmer you wo n't be disappointed as always , the quality is outstanding as with every essie color i own
5	got that frosty 90s vibe going on , but it 's kind of supposed to
5	many years ago when i started shaving , my dad gave me a double edged razor and a can of shaving cream , pointed me at the sink and said have at it when i finished i looked as though i had a fight with the family cat and was the apparent loser of the battle since that time i have come full circle in my shaving experience and many different razors later , from the disposable to the gillette 5 blade razor the vibrates and i have arrived back at the good old de razor , except now i know what i am doing and i now get the finest save i have ever had the merkur razor , merkur safety razor 39c chrome is a slant razor it is slanted to give a motion to your whiskers some compare it to the action of a snow the angle allows for the blade to slice the slant bar was a common design in germany in which the blade is slightly angled and curved along its length to make for a action and a more rigid cutting edge having use a razor for years i find the 39c slant head with the right blades give me as close of shave as my straight razors all this being said there are 2 things to be careful of this is a very well designed razor , nicely , smooth action , and well balanced 1 do not expect to get a close , \( baby bottom smooth \) shave by spreading shaving foam over you face and going to town at it you must learn to wet shave first this means to get your beard nice and wet either in the shower or using a hot , wet towel , using a preshave oil or lotion or using a good quality shaving soap or cream like or arko my suggestion is to go to the wal mart and buy the soap , bowl and brush , take a nice hot shower , wash your face well and take your time shaving we in the wet shaving community know what the dark side of shaving is , but if you follow a ritual when you shave and do n't rush you will be surprised how much you , not only look forward to , but enjoy shaving kind of your little get away also how you will become a research nut when it comes to all the soaps , creams , lotions and equipment anyway , this is one great razor and i us the super stainless steel platinum coated double edge safety razor blades a k a because they are coated but not crazy sharp like the feather blades are this razor takes a touch and you will develop it with time read other reviews and watch you tube go to the badger and blade forum and read all about wet shaving , double edge and straight shaves again , this is one great razor and well worth the time and money invested
5	another great neutral from essie ! more of a brown tone for that boho vibe !
3	pretty color but did n't cover well
3	a unique and really pretty color , but the formula was n't as good as other vinylux polishes and it did n't wear as well
4	like it
1	the container is too small , , , it is much smaller then the applicator , so i cannot use it at all
5	so great !
3	eh , it took 3 of these to cover my whole body , and the color change was pretty subtle the less expensive drug store brand tan towels are much more bold in their effect , and one covers your whole body i think i 'll save these for the winter when i do n't want to look too fake tan , and i 'll use my drug store ones for the summer
5	i 've tried many obagi products , and i love them all this sunscreen is light enough to wear under makeup and goes on smoothly and evenly there is a very slight sunscreen smell , but only when it is being applied this absorbs really quickly my face feels soft , and the spf protection is more than adequate it 's nice to use a sunscreen that doubles as a moisturizer , also obagi products are more expensive than most , but for my sensitive fair skin , i have found few other brands that consistently work well for me glad to add this one to my daily regimen
5	love it
4	very soft , natural color ideal for at home long lasting , non chipping excellent product
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	i do n't have a lot of acne issues but i definitely have some stubborn spots on my neck much to my surprise , this vichy treatment worked really well ! it goes on clear , and dries up the acne as advertised it 's a small tube , but since you are doing spot treatment i think it will last awhile very pleased to have this in my medicine cabinet
5	just gorgeous , richer than essie 's i'm addicted and i ca n't decide which one i like better !
5	i use this brush it works well after i wash my hair the instructions on the boar bristle ones say not to use them with wet hair this is a good alternative it actually gets right to the root , just like the boar bristle brushes do and feels pretty good i do n't have really long hair , but i can see how this brush would be a gentle way to brush hair that is long all in all , it 's a good product i recommend it
3	this is a very mild cleanser for those with very sensitive skin it will not remove eye makeup but that was indicated in the description given if you are someone who likes to double cleanse this would be good for a second step cleanser the pluses are that it is fragrance free and not tested on animals

5	this butter brand polish has added to my collection from this brand the colours \( and \) are great the less toxic ingredients are an added bonus !
5	works amazing , just very black !
5	product was as described
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
4	this vitamin c packed product is gentle in the face and smells fairly neutral i'm not sure it is a miracle cure though the main reason i reduced it by 1 star was because 20 for one fluid ounce is a bit steep in my book however , if your face is really worth it , go for it
5	love it ! absolutely love shellac ! i do my nails at home , so i purchase my shellac on amazon so far so good i love all colors that i get this one is particularly my favorite i would recommend it to anybody !
5	just recently my skin on my cheeks on either side of my nose has gotten rough and bumpy i used some oils on it from various other products and the skin smoothed , but needed constant attention with the moisturizing after using this for about a week i 've seen a lot of improvement i do n't need to use it several times a day like the other facial oils i used not sure what ingredient in the product is providing healing , but i'm pleased noticed improvement the first day of using this \( about three or four times \) and for the next few days i also used it several times a day and my remained smooth and healthy looking around the fifth day i used it in the morning and forgot to bring it with me to work and was a bit concerned that my face would , but it did n't and now i'm using it just in the morning i ca n't speak for all the claims the product description makes but it got rid of my bumpy , patchy reddened skin !
4	the blemish clearing cleanser really gives a deep down cleanse , lathers nicely too the blemish clearing serum worked ok i prefer a higher 2 of salicylic acid this one is 75 which may work for some , but does n't help much with my adult acne the oil free moisturizer is lightweight , worked fine , but nothing out of the ordinary the added blemish clearing peel was a nice treat i felt like it did brighten my complexion and made my face feel soft i only wish a sample of the blemish clearing powder would 've been included as is , it is a very nice good size set to try juice beauty to clear your complexion my reason for 4 stars is because of the smell of the products i found it to smell a little medicinal overall , good value and the cleanser and mask is worth the price for the whole kit
5	this butter london bronzer clutch is a beautiful quality color palette that comes in a lovely 4 1 2 x 3 compact inside , the compact has three warm brown shades of bronzer contour makeup , an on the glow highlighting pen and a nice quality mirror the bronzer contour makeup is rich in color and a velvety smooth texture that reminds me of a high end eye shadow the frame of the compact lifts up so individual contour colors can be changed out and new ones can be added the compact closes tightly and does n't leak , so i can carry it in my purse just as it is , or i can carry it in my cosmetic bag my makeup routine has been dull for years now \( concealer , powder foundation , blush , mascara and lipstick \) , and my fair but olive skin tone can look drab it 's really fun to switch up my routine by using this bronzer contour palette i do n't have a contour brush , so i use a blush brush to apply and blend the colors , and it works just fine this makeup adds such a warm glow that lifts my skin tone and adds some much needed definition and contour to my face i'm just learning about contour makeup and am so pleased with how easy it is to apply and blend this makeup for a smooth appearance and i love the results this contour makeup creates the illusion of higher cheekbones and even makes my face look slimmer i'm still practicing how best to use this palette , so i appreciate the included tips that show how to accentuate features , achieve definition and get a natural looking glow by blending the darkest color in my cheek hollows followed by the bronze color on my cheekbones , and the lightest shade at the top the instructions show how to use the highlighting pen for added contouring and enhancement of lips and eyes it really just takes a little experimentation to see what looks best on me , and so far i'm really happy with how little effort it takes to achieve a really flattering look the bronzer contour color is made in the usa , and the gold highlighter is made in korea this is a gorgeous product that i definitely recommend
5	i have this on my desk at work and i mist my face whenever i look at it smells nice and refreshes your face and moisturizes it for sure
3	please note i have sensitive skin so others with normal skin might have no problems at all i was using the sunscreen and d eacute colletage repairing items on my chest and it caused a terrible rash i started using this eye cream at the same time and did n't have any problems until after about 2 weeks of use than i started getting a similar rash around my eyes i have stopped use of this entire line of products
4	this is a good product that evens skin tone and covers imperfections in the skin blotchiness , acne , freckles , etc i tried it instead of my liquid foundation and it went on smoothly and the color was natural looking there are a variety of shades to choose from from very fair to dark it is somewhat drying and would be better for normal to oily skin the matte finish , fixed with light spray , and lasts well i like that it is fragrance free although it 's expensive , if someone needs to cover facial skin problems , this does the job
4	love the color , perfect for summer it 's a little on the thin side , which i find is usual for essie colors , but multiple coats leaves you with a solid , light coral color
5	gotta have this
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
5	i got a small sample tube of this cream with a beauty box i subscribe to before that tube was gone i was here on amazon buying the full size i have sensitive skin and it 's always on the dry side i was going through a very bad spell that lasted for days after having used a mask that was way too irritating my skin was actually sore while using the sample , my skin irritation vanished completely so i thought afterward that maybe it was a little heavy , but i 've been using and loving it ever since it is very pricey , but the price here was actually much lower than on the web site associated with the beauty box i got my sample in definitely great prices on this brand here on amazon you only need a tiny pea size amount to moisturize your whole face , so the tube lasts the consistency is like a thick gel cream that spreads easily over your entire face it 's super moisturizing and the moisturized feeling lasts me all day now this cream would likely be too heavy for people who have oilier skin , and i may have to back off a tiny bit in the hottest part of the summer , but otherwise , this is my go to moisturizer i absolutely love this stuff !
5	this cnd shellac is very durable and stays on without chipping until my nails grow out and i have to remove it myself
5	i am a believer i bought this polish and applied it as instructed and it lasted a 10 days i work with my hands and wear gloves on and off all day i also do dishes at least three times a week there was some very small minor chipping at the tips but because my nails also grew out i just filed them down and the chipping was gone and the polish looked new on one of the nails where it chipped in the corner i just applied some more polish to that tip corner and it was fine after that i am very happy with my purchase any new color i want i will check and see if it is offered in vinylux before i purchase another brand it is easy to apply and dries quickly which is great my nails feel stronger the polish feels thicker than normal polish and is very strong once dried i have n't tried to take it off yet so i do n't know how easy that is but it has to be easier than gel i like gel polish but i get bored with the color after a week and want a new color this is the perfect happy medium for me to have color that last for a week but i do n't have to commit to for two weeks
3	heard a lot of recommendation and good review about this but personally i do n't think it did much help first of all , this did not really do anything to my pimple second of all , it is really hard to just rub it off
5	this burberry eau de toilette is such a unique , masculine scent it 's not overbearing and not musky at all a very strong masculine scent with just a touch of floral will make a great gift for any male that does n't care for the musk scents
5	i have been doing makeup and skincare for almost 12 years and this is my favorite foundation i love using it with my airbrush for bridal makeup ! it refines the look of enlarged pores , acne or fine lines it has no fragrance and wo n't cause acne this foundation can be used with a foundation stippling brush for a flawless finish as well so it is a very versatile formula because it is a silicone base it really has great longevity on the skin it is natural looking and makes the skin look like silk ! my clients all rave about it ! go flawless go with s b foundation is my favorite warm shade
5	nice color was looking for a true mauve needs 3 coats to be that color , but that might just be on my discolored nails very conservative , but not that pinky color that i do n't like
5	i really do like this and it does seem to brush through my hair easier and not so many fly aways and feels more soft
4	very nice product , the organic ingredients have a pleasant scent and a very clean , fresh , non chemical feel easy to use , absorbs quickly , and did not irritate my skin brightens well time will tell about the age defying qualities , yet on the overall , this is a very nice mid priced serum recommended
3	these do n't work near as well as the biore strips i really wanted to like them but they do n't stick or seem to clear out pores near as well as other brands
3	this product worked well , but the rotation was too quick it was very hard to keep it from rolling to fast and tightening to hard against my head , tangling my hair
3	at first i thought they sent the wrong color , but the name on the bottle is correct the picture is totally different than what i got
2	i 've used many concealers to cover my dark circles over the years when i opened the easy to use lipstick type tube , i was more than surprised to see a brown concealer brown \? i have fair skin and no way did it work for me i tried it on some spots and it the area it also did not go on smoothly i then tried to apply a foundation over it , and the area still had a very dark color i would give it one star , but maybe if i had a lighter color , it would be beneficial i 've actually not seen any concealer this dark , but i assume it works for some skin types
5	i bought this after reading so much about how it helps wrinkles and how oprah 's beauty uses it so far , so good ! i can see a slight improvement already it stings a bit when putting it on but that goes away after a few seconds i use it every other night , the other nights i use the retin a prescription tretinoin cream
5	my fav zoya polish by far and i have a few dozen first coat will be gelly like , you will be able to see through it a little second coat will give you the most amazing result a on your nail im not kidding those glitters totally look like stars in the navy base and they look like they are not all on the same flat surface but they really do look like stars in space some are further away , some are closer i do n't know how that 's possible but its true also this polish is very long lasting , even compared to other zoya
5	my wife has tried a lot of eye creams for her crows feet she has n't liked them i even got the eye roll when i gave her this one nia 24 was different though over time my wife said the skin around her eyes felt more taught and smooth it does n't completely erase those crows feet , but they do n't look quite as prominent she says she 'll never buy another brand
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i love the smell of this perfume ! i love the mix of floral with some woody notes a fresh scent that is not overpowering scent lasts most of the day , and the spray top emits a perfect amount of fragrance
4	this is my 1st time using zoya nail polish i absolutely love the color ! ! ! it is the perfect nude for my skin tone ! ! i love that it is 10 free ! feels good to know i'm putting less chemicals on my very thin natural nails all that being said i did find that this polish is very thick and a little hard to apply it took 2 coats to get a somewhat even application maybe it having less chemicals makes it a thicker paint , so i took one star away for that reason i will try again and see if i can get a better application next time because i am truly obsessed with this color ! ! i have included photos with and without the flash on so you can see the true color of
5	i received lots of compliments on this color it is so pretty and great for summer
5	love this buy it buy it buy it you wo n't regret it it 's amazing to get to try these high end brands and then get a credit too for future purchases ! these sell out fast , buy when you can !
3	i used this cream on my face since i have sensitive skin it applies very smoothly it feels good on my skin and feels very as though it 's moisturizing well enough the problem is that it tastes awful it 's not that i it but i was drinking a bottle of water and my lips and just could not get the taste out of my mouth i do n't know how this could be used on a babies face , with all the they do
4	i'm fair , cool toned from the photos , i was afraid to try this , thinking it would be way too dark it barely shows up on my skin i have dry skin , and i never have any oily shine during the course of my day the matte i apply to places i want to minimize , and the dewy side i apply to areas i want to bring out more , like the tops of my cheekbones i apply a tiny bit of the dewy side right above my eye brows \( not the brow bone , the brow \) and it gives the illusion of my eyes being lifted i really like this , but i wish it lasted all day on me , i need to retouch every 3 to 4 hours it seems to soak into my skin fast , or else it just goes away , i'm not sure
3	maybe setting sprays are not for me i tried this over my regular \( not dermablend \) foundation , and while i found it unpleasant to spray something at my own face , i will say it did seem to make my makeup a bit smoother just hold your breath , because this is sort of smelly like chemical smelly i had to spray a cloud of perfume to while initially my makeup looked good , after a day of sitting at a desk with a desk fan , my make up was coming off just as usual i do have oily skin , so that could be a major reason why perhaps if it were drier this would have stayed i think i 'll stick with the powder setting stuff for now , as i can easily reapply it at work and it does n't smell weird
5	slight burn 3 night hate smell bottle dropper not sanitary skin shiny it is so smooth
5	i stumbled across this lotion as i was searching for hand creams containing an spf , and i had no idea that it would become such a favorite of mine ! i was unable to wear my wedding rings all winter because of this dermatitis in between my fingers i 'd tried every lotion , cream , ointment , prescription , you name it this lotion cleared it up and has kept it away after just a few uses my hands are baby soft and i like wearing it , knowing that i'm protecting my skin ca n't say enough good things about this hand cream
5	i 've had the chance to try several xen tan products and so far this is the only one i would purchase again the mousse formula goes on easily and dries much faster than many other self tanners the color develops into a nice , rich tan without any hint of orange be sure to wear some sort of protection on your hands when applying you can order the xen tan mitt or use disposable gloves but you 'll definitely need something to keep your hands from absorbing too much stain but the mousse consistency makes application easy to control with very nice , believable results that lasts several days
4	this is cnd 's new product the product itself if awesome and this color , very nice i am to buying more colors
5	i'm not sure how i never realized there was a device like this until the last year maybe they were only in nail salons , but i have been missing out on something extraordinary ! i also have the amope \( a similar device \) , and i truly did n't think i could like something better than the amope , but i do prefer this callus remover with one exception this one has a combination type off on switch , where you have to press down a safety button and then slide it up turning it on was fairly easy , but turning it off was a challenge at first it does n't slide down to turn off as easily as it slides up to turn on the amope has a off on switch where you just twist on the handle and turn it on , and twist again to turn it off i greatly prefer the amope on off switch , but besides that one feature , i greatly prefer the the silk'n callus remover while the roller on this one seems much smaller than the one on the amope , it is more effective it removed the dry skin on my heel quickly and this remover comes with two rollers , a coarse roller and a polish roller i think the amope roller \( it only has the one roller \) is a cross between the two because while it also removes the dried skin , it does it slower the coarse roller on this remover is a beast ! it quickly removed the skin on my heels in a manner of a few seconds it 's truly amazing it also comes with a brush to clean the device \( the amope did n't have a brush \) i also tried the polish roller , but i really did n't think it did anything and doubt i would use it again after about a month of use on the amope , i did change the roller due to decreased performance , but i'm pleased to note in the silk'n roller instruction guide it actually states replace the roller depending upon the intensity of use , but generally after one year that would be great , as you would n't need to buy many refills also , i noticed that this device is quieter when i used the coarse compared to the amope and one last really nice feature is it 's size and shape this device is lighter in weight , slimmer in the handle , more ergonomic , and easier to hold in general , especially for smaller hands or hands with arthritis i'm a fan !
5	ok
4	the iron heats up to the highest setting in just one minute i gather it would be even faster for lower settings the white outside is all plastic and so is the golden part the cord is longer than usual , and it is really nice , i did n't realize how 6 cord feels until i tried the t3 the cord also swivels easily so i do not have to worry that it will tangle , and i do not have to fight with tangled up cord the ceramic area is very smooth and it works perfectly , but it is on the smaller size , about 1 inch by 4 inches , so it is great for shorter hair , but it would be too little for longer hair that needs a lot of work the iron looks very stylish they include a heat proof mat , but it is quite small , and black , looks like it is made of dense felt it looks ok on my very dark brown vanity , but it just not as pretty as the iron itself i checked out the warranty on the iron , and they say for the warranty the iron has to be purchased from an authorized retailer , and it has to have a silver sticker with the number the problem is that the sticker is located on the box , not on the iron itself , so if you throw the box away you might be in trouble if something goes wrong it also looks like in case of warranty claim you will have to send the iron to them first before they will evaluate it and decide if they replace it , and it should take 3 weeks i am not comfortable with this kind of customer care for such an expensive luxury product
4	this is certainly a thick cream ! i like that because you can really control the amount you use and you only need a small \( very small ! \) amount at a time if you use too much , you 'll get that greasy feeling i think the scent is pleasant it seems a bit strong out of the jar , but as it goes on your skin , it seems to lighten up a bit and i do n't find any real lingering scent i 've used it pretty much everywhere on my body and prefer it for my arms \( elbows \) and my feet \( heels \) i do n't really think it 's an intensive body repair treatment , as the name indicates especially for the price \( 00 is the going rate on amazon as of this review , for a 10 oz jar \) it does the job as a moisturizer and i was fortunate enough to get it as a , but i do n't think i would purchase it again for that price
5	i really liked the way this moisturizer , because in my opinion that 's what it is , was absorbed into my skin so far as making dark spots get lighter , i ca n't vouch for that as it takes 8 weeks , according to the information on the box , for this to occur however , my skin did feel softer after just a few applications of this cream i'm not sure if the corrector cream contains any sunscreen but since i applied it after i applied serum , it does n't make a lot of difference to me just as an aside , i like the subtle fragrance of the product
4	my favorite shade ever looks better than in the bottle \( almost like a us money green color \)
3	i loved the application of this product , very smooth , no smell , no white patches and , supposedly , all natural then i looked at the inactive ingredients ! ewg rates this product 3 for problematic ingredients the most problematic is the octinoxate , which they rate 6 ! i'm torn i have not found another sunscreen with as good an application as this one but i do n't want to put harmful things on my skin i have decided to return it sigh ! update i just discovered that ewg rates highly the coola plant based sunscreen \( not this one \) the reviews for that product , however , suggest it leaves a white paste , like most other sunscreens i'm going dr 's face stick it got good reviews here
5	this stuff is amazing ! as soon as you see a pimple starting to form , put this on overnight and it will dramatically reduce the size and redness , plus speed up the healing process ! i already have dry skin and this does not cause an excessive drying the only con is that it smells kind of bad , like
3	darker than it should be but it blends well and with foundation over it there is n't a problem it cannot be used alone however because it leaves obvious spots i was hoping for a concealer that would blend well enough that it could be used alone when i do n't want to apply foundation it is quite thick and it does blend smoothly but the end result is that you can still see the attempt to conceal so , this is very nice if you plan to use your regular foundation over it
5	\( purchased form ulta \) right now i have oily combination skin , but mostly oily on t zone and cheeks i decided to get the regimen kit by this company , and in it is a sample of this product i cleaned my face and used the toner , then tried this item i loved it instantly it goes on so smoothly and easily you only need a tiny bit , even my sample will last a week or two with how little i need to use it sinks in my skin and leaves me with a nice velvety finish the next morning i woke up to smooth skin ! no oil ! i was so blown away i went and purchased the normal size it 's pricy , i never usually spend more than 7 on a product so this is new to me but i want to take my skincare seriously and will make the investment also , i got another free sample of this cream with my full size purchase from ulta
5	love , love it ! works great with the sunscreen i purchased on the advise of my derma doctor makes my skin look and feel great after my nightly application of retinal ! highly suggest !
5	i love this creamy foundation , a little dab will go a long way it covers my freckles , age spot , and large pores easily do n't apply this too heavily as it will look and settle into wrinkles i found i needed to check my face from time to time to lightly smooth out the foundation that settled into lines it is water resistant as i first applied it to my hand and went to wash it off and i had to scrub it a little for it to wash away highly recommend !
3	the reason i give it 3 stars is because i do n't think it made my hair any different better or worse and because the price is so high it 's a little too much i believe there are much better products out there for far less money
5	loved this nail polish ! such a pretty purple grey color not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either i love essie colors , especially purple and will continue buying them !
3	the henckels grooming set is a beautifully packed grooming set everything is wonderfully packaged in a leather holding case , the nail clippers are ultra slim and cuts nails with great ease , and the nail file does a fine job of getting everything well filed down the nose hair clipper , however falls short from the mark i do n't mind that it 's manually operated , as it give the user control over the speed of the clipper i also like how it can rotate in either direction , so that if a hair gets caught , you can reverse the direction so the pulling unfortunately , hairs do seem to get caught fairly easily with this unit , and while it 's not as shocking to get a hair like with an electric trimmer , i expected much more from a henckels product and expected no hair at all ! i'm guessing that if hairs are getting caught and now while new and at it 's sharpest it may cause larger amounts of pain later if you have a higher threshold for pain , or do n't get at a nose hair or two , this set is truly a handsome grooming set just be aware the nose trimmer is like any other trimmer hairs will most likely get
3	while this did indeed have moisturizing properties and left my hands feeling quite nice i felt that the delivery was a bit of an over kill with the ill fitting and uncomfortable plastic gloves i also felt that there was a great deal of waste with oil lotion left behind in the gloves and that this product would be better served in a bottle or tube like any other lotion rather than try to be trendy and cost more
5	even the slightest hint of humidity causes my wife 's hair to frizz out of control when we have time off we go to the where the extreme humidity takes her frizziness over the top this arrived in time for a vacation to , mexico with about the highest humidity yet she tried this the first morning and it worked far beyond her expectations she had not the slightest trace of frizz yet her hair was n't flat or oily and looked full and healthy it styled easily for myself i do n't have her problem so i was n't impressed for my own sake but she will be sure to always have this before we travel
2	it probably does what it says , but man it burns my skin while it 's on says leave on for 5 10 minutes , but at 5 minutes i have to wash it off does really the skin , like it says but i'm sure there are other products that do so without the burn
3	not a fan of this cream , and i certainly did n't see any measurable difference in a month i know this cream is for men , but it was woman tested
5	i love nail polish \( what girl does n't \) and this pretty , girly color stays on fabulously i 'll definitely be ordering more in other colors
5	definitely a small tube but you do n't need much it lasted me at least 2 months , used it daily very soft and gentle for sensitive skin around eyes
5	great base coat and it is beautiful on it 's own under a layer of top coat goes on well and dries quickly it is very matte i love it and use it first for french manicures , then white tips \( cotton white \) then top coat
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	i have never tried the original gel , so this review is based solely on the performance of this product for me i used this to help bring out the waves of my shoulder length hair , and it did ok , but not as well as other products one of my favorite products is paul mitchell 's sculpting gel , and this one is not as good as that i felt like this product was somewhat sticky , and my hair was drying in crunchy locks \( i used about a nickel sized glob \) it took a lot of working through with my fingers to break up the crunchy sections and get a natural look of waves i think that 's kind of because without the crunch is part of the ad copy it is if i mist my hair and re scrunch it does smell really good , so that 's a plus is it body building \? that seems like a bold claim it was able to help my hair hold a good mess of waves , and my hair definitely looks like it has body , so maybe so i think on short hair you 'd have to be very sparing with this or you 'll end up with a crunchy mess since the tube is quite small \( for a hair gel \) , maybe that 's a good thing
5	you use these products with a uv lamp that you could also buy here at amazon i use it on top of acrylic nails too the color on my acrylics never comes off so i only need to change my color whenever i get my fill i have been using these products for almost 3 years now i love it !
5	not as shimmery as the image shows , its definitely like a dark gray , the image looks more of a 'silvery' look , but still a really great color i love it
3	i have one huge , huge warning for you if your skin is especially sensitive then you may want to exercise extreme caution with this mask my skin is n't overwhelmingly sensitive , but it is sensitive enough to where my face did burn and get a little red after i removed the mask so i do n't think that this will be something i do on a weekly basis i would chalk this up to the glycolic acid , i suppose my skin 's just a little weird in how it reacts to new cosmetics i do want to note that it did get better after patting the skin down a little and applying a little lotion however does it work \? well , i ca n't really give you a complete answer for this because this is the sort of thing that would be best over a long period of time and i'm not honestly sure if i 'll do this on a regular enough basis to where i 'd see overwhelming differences for my skin i'm someone who has always had problem pores and that 's why i selected this from amazon vine , so that was the first thing i looked for when i took the mask off it may be me hoping that my pores were smaller , but they did n't look as big as they did beforehand i did n't see an overwhelmingly huge difference , but that may be something i 'd see over time my skin did feel a little softer afterwards as well i ca n't honestly give any huge description on its anti aging claims since i'm right on the of starting to show my age , so i do n't have any overwhelmingly visible age lines yet they 're there , but small i can mostly thank my father 's genes for that , though so is this worth it \? it looks like it does a pretty good job the price for this would be a little daunting for me if i were to buy it with my own money , but i do have to say that a little bit goes a very , very long way for my first mask i was able to pretty much just use the mask clay that was on the top of the jar lid my only big gripe so far \( other than the slight irritation for my skin \) was how messy this can be when it comes to removing it i definitely recommend using the old for this one , since it does leave somewhat of a stain on the cloth even if you constantly rinse it out i really want to give this a higher rating , but i just ca n't get past the burning irritated feeling that this left on my skin i'm just not sure that this is really right for people with sensitive skin like mine i 'll try to get my mother to use it as her skin is delicate but not as finicky as mine is and try to report back on what she says i think i 'd like this better if it came with a slightly smaller dose of glycolic acid in it
5	she needed green nail polish and thought she might like the color i bought it she got it , and i'm surprised but uses it all the time she loves the color and i may have to buy another now totally worth it to see the expression on her face
4	i use toners and essence regularly and was happy to try the meg 21 toner its packaging gives it two covers to prevent it from leaking or accidentally spraying it has a spray pump i sprayed the toner on my freshly washed face , then patted the toner in and waited for it to dry it left my skin soft but with no lingering wetness or stickiness i like that the toner uses plant extracts that supposedly counteract the bad effects of sugar in your diet i have n't used the toner long enough to see a significant change in my skin quality but it feels just as good as the popular and expensive japanese and korean toners on the
2	i was disappointed by this i have an enzyme cleanser by another brand and it does a great job at exfoliating dry skin i thought that 's what enzymes did not the mario badescu gel my skin is still dry and flaky it does n't foam , which i could live with , but i also ca n't see it on my skin so it 's hard to tell if i 've thoroughly covered my face it does have a great smell and a cooling sensation , though i do n't want cooling in the winter time i also still got zits while using this , so this product is useless to me \( but i appreciate receiving this as a free promotional gift as i had been to buy it \)
4	i got really excited to try this cologne because it sounded like it would remind me of another favorite nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href salvador dali by salvador dali for men eau de toilette spray 3 4 ounces dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 salvador dali by salvador dali for men eau de toilette spray 3 4 ounces a as it turned out , this fragrance smells almost identical to salvador dali so if you want to save a lot of money you can just buy the old classic it does have some differences though sweet tobacco spirits is slightly sweeter , i think , a little lighter but also a little stronger maybe i'm just getting old but it can be if too much is used there is a strong tobacco scent the good kind , not the cough inducing kind it 's kinda dark , , better for autumn winter months than summer i do like that it lasts a long time and one spray is all you need actually , half a spray is all you need overall this is a good scent for men looking to the tobacco essence definitely gives it a more scent given the for tobacco now , be wary that it could negative impressions by some people i see it more older gentlemen , but younger guys going for vintage flare could also make it work
3	i find this to be just your regular salicylic acne treatment but with a fancy applicator which is quite pointless i would never put the applicator directly on my skin especially if it is on acne \( hello contamination ! germs and bacteria \? ! \) it worked fine for me , salicylic acid is much better for my sensitive skin especially now that winter is near , but my j j acne treatment worked just as well too
3	i'm not too impressed with the quality for the price i really thought it was going to be something wonderful , it ended up being a lower quality than opi nail polishes you have to apply several coats to get a solid color
3	i'm reviewing this early \( i e , the company recommends using this for 60 days and i 've been using it for 30 \) , however the for this review was half way through the recommended period over which you would see dramatic results i'm not a spa person , so the little shocks were a bit off putting , though as i 've improved my technique , i do n't go past my hairline as much and have minimized shocks if you are sensitive to pain , this may not be the treatment for you it 's not a big , bad shock , just a little zap which can be unsettling if you 're not prepared for it the good lots of great videos to help the learn how to use this tool also , it 's a great size , not clunky fits very ergonomically into your hand the bad i'm a busy person do n't see this as a permanent fixture in my routine they have a video where a woman is using the device while children off to school i'm not a multi i'm also so i prefer to be in front of a mirror when using this , even after four weeks also , you will be spending money for the face lubricant every few months , so add that to the list of considerations when contemplating purchasing this product \( disclaimer i do n't know how much this process is worth in spa dollars , so you may come out ahead ! \) the it 's a well designed machine i did n't see a great deal of difference , but the ritual itself is very soothing i say , if this is your thing , then it 's probably worth the price
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	this is a great product it 's easily applied and easy to remove lasts all day
4	as noted , i'm still evaluating this item and i suspect that long term use will reveal its benefits , or lack thereof so far , i have n't noticed huge differences , but i did feel that my brows looked a bit lifted immediately after use it also seemed to tighten up the area under my jawline i'm talking about improvement , but it does seem to help i also used aloe vera gel in addition to the supplied gel , so perhaps that could save you money once you run out of the nuface provided product one does sometimes feel a mild tingling sensation , but hey it 's electrical micro current but it 's not painful or especially unpleasant i'm going to try to continue to use this device daily and may upgrade , downgrade or add to this review depending on my future experience but 4 stars for now , as it does seem to offer some level of improvement
4	aside from the price , i love this product i actually like the scent a lot , subtle and pleasant leaves my skin feeling smooth and rejuvenated , absorbs quickly
4	this is a very nice , creamy moisturizer which does live up to its name , and is a good cream during the winter months despite being thick and moisturizing , i 've had no issues using it during the day \( though it does n't have any sunscreen in it \) it helps with the dry , cold weather affecting my skin and does n't bother my makeup at all the only thing is this is a very small jar of makeup it is lasting me a good while because this is such a creamy , potent moisturizer , but be aware that this is less than an ounce of product \( that 2 4 ounces is mostly the glass jar \) it 's a small size so good for traveling , but not for a long term product hence why it does n't cost much still , this is helping with dry skin and has n't caused any adverse reactions
5	i use this after my shower and before a light lotion on my face before i put on makeup it 's quick to use and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean love it and would recommend to anyone
5	this is a great summer polish for toes and fingers , but i mostly wear it on my toes it 's a great shade of pink that does n't clash with anything else you might be wearing and essie pretty much wo n't chip \( at least on your toes \) for at least a week great great color !
5	i have used this for over 20 years it is not sticky or oily and it is spf 33 ! ! i use it every morning
4	pretty color , but not as opaque as i 'd hoped even with 3 coats , the white of my nails is visible
5	i use this once a week as a substitute for a conditioner helps to extend the rich highlights added to my natural blonde hair has a very pleasing scent
1	the description says can be used with or without water , so i tried it both ways without water left my skin feeling greasy , so i began rinsing it off unfortunately , neither method was good for my skin shortly after i began using this cleanser , my skin broke out a lot i then began using the 3 in 1 simply as a makeup remover and then using my regular skincare regimen after that 's how i discovered that this cleanser was actually leaving a lot of makeup behind which is probably why i was breaking out so much although i like the milky feel when putting it on , this product simply does n't work for my skin
5	this is a definite skin ! obagi gentle rejuvenation soothing cleanser is a great way to cleanse your face for me , it keeps my skin soft after using , even if i do n't put on moisturizer i am also letting my daughter use this because she has some angry acne this will help sooth her painful skin this is a clear liquid cleanser that really does soothe and cleanse skin very gently but with great results if i use this at night to wash my face , the next morning my skin still feels very soft this cleans off make up and soothes it will be great for the summer months when the sun dries out my skin
3	when i look at women who wear makeup this thick , i want to get out my putty knife this stuff covers the small blemishes but it made some of my larger dark marks even darker thicker is n't better
5	i have this and silver vip status and recommend them both i usually make the decision to layer when i'm bored with the manicure underneath or want to give the look a pop be advised this is subtle sophisticated glitter if you want a , this will disappoint but i think it 's great for office wear or for those who do n't like the chunky glitter look put it on top of anything i used this recently over pretty poison and was very pleased the green and gold worked well together recommended !
5	i love anything opi and this was definitely up to par ! !
5	love this color , natural and elegant opi is great nail polish and this is my go to color
5	all hail the queen was my first bottle of polish by butter london tired of thin polishes from essie and not really excited by opi at the moment , i finally decided to give this brand a try i 've purchased a bottle of chanel polish before , but 15 for nail color still seems steep to me i picked this color because it seemed safe lol and i just wanted to try the product line i really do like the color having brown skin it 's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the the application reminded me a lot of the chanel bottle i have not just the removable top cover , but the fact that it brushes on neatly you wo n't end up with too much on the brush , minimizing clean up and product waste the color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old sally hansen polishes , minus the color change effect i do like the texture of the polish and it 's wearable with or without a topcoat this color can also be worn well at one or two coats the drying time was fast , but i ca n't speak too much for the longevity yet i see complaints about chipping polish , which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth , well buffed and totally clean of all oils after a day of wear , shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact , at least \( i used out the door topcoat \) i'm not saying i'm a butter london fan just yet lol , but i did like this polish enough to order a second color when i saw my polish outdoors the next day , i ordered 3 more bottles of butter london polish from amazon lol while i'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one , i'm happy i finally gave this brand a try
5	mom likes it
3	no study has shown that parabens cause cancer , or that they are harmful in any way , but studies have that parabens can act similarly to , and activity in the body has been associated with certain forms of breast cancer some may say that it 's an over reaction , but in a family with members that have a genetic to breast cancer and or have breast cancer , parabens are avoided it is entirely my mistake that i ordered scott vincent borba anti fatigue concealer kit i missed that it contains methylparaben therefore , it would n't be fair to give scott vincent borba anti fatigue concealer kit a negative rating because of i'm if you have no qualms about parabens , this looks like a product worth trying if you too have paraben , i can suggest nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nars radiant creamy concealer vanilla dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 nars radiant creamy concealer , vanilla a nbsp \( more colors than vanilla are available \)
5	i have tried every bb and cc known to ! drugstore brands , and department store high end this is hands down my fav ! my skin looks like me but better ! i have oily skin and this does n't make me greasy ! i love it never trying another brand !
5	i have really sensitive lips and a lot of products will make them dry out or flake easily these are a lot of lip scrubs and b i 've tried all the ones in sephora ! this one is amazing really exfoliates and does n't dry out or give a bad reaction i still always moisturize after
5	product is a 10 makes your hair baby soft love it
5	love this color ! ! perfect for summer
4	this is a salon quality oribe conditioner for blonde hair unlike traditional conditioners , this one is a spray rather than a cream liquid it consists of a fine purple mist that is sprayed on then rinsed out after three minutes it has a pleasant scent nothing too strong or lingering after using a few weeks , i did not see much improvement when it comes to the claims of repairing damage to my color treated hair but it does condition well and keeps my hair from looking too brassy a downside for me is the application i have used spray conditioners in the past , but these are usually the leave in type that i can apply \( and control \) once i am out of the shower using a spray in the shower is awkward for me and wastes too much product i did get better results by spraying into my hands and then through my hair the price point is higher than other salon conditioners but it does work if you do n't mind the cost
1	the brush is splayed out so i ca n't really use it just seems like cheap bristles or something \?
5	this is the best dandruff shampoo it does not dry out scalp it smells good it is worth the extra money as it really works and leaves the hair in good condition
5	got a lot of compliments polish is naturally chip resistant good brand of polish , opi is my other fav , this is the first time i tried essie now i am open to essie as well as opi \( tip learned from my manicurist that the essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is not the real essie beware \)
5	awesome color that is perfect for fall !
5	first of all , this is a review for phyto mix and mask hair trio the system is me to this product site and i cannot change it i just want to say that i 've used this hair system for a week now my spouse to test it since she is very particular about what she uses on her hair so , i am a guy and have a full head of gray silver hair that is starting to thin my hair is also somewhat dry during the cooler weather months so i thought i would give it a try i know these are n't cheap products , but i must say , my hair has never felt or looked better ! i use the masks very sparingly after shampooing i actually towel dry my hair , apply a combination of the 3 masks \( you can determine what works best for you based on your specific hair conditions \) i wait 5 minutes , then rinse after a quick blow dry , i can literally feel and see a difference in my hair it is fuller , shiny \( or should i say lustrous \? \) and very soft my spouse has remarked how much better it looks and brushing is all i need to get it into a nice style for the day i can honestly say that if you have dry , damaged hair , these masks can provide a solution that is gentle , and does n't contain a lot of chemicals the performance of my usual hair shampoo conditioner in comparison
5	i have had two babies and do not have a single stretch mark to show for it \( thank goodness \) i have no idea if it was from using the mustela skincare products or not , but i like them so much that i would definitely not take a chance on having stretch marks the lotion is very creamy and smell is soft and almost like a product that you would use on a baby the bust firming serum is a gel and i used that more on my neck than i did on my breast the cost of this lotion initially seems a little high , but if it the end result is smooth , it is worth every penny
4	not sure why it matters what color this illuminator is in the bottle liquid light looks no different than any other illuminator i 've ever used illuminator is generally a translucent product , actually , i think it 's great that japonesque offers slightly different shades for a more tone if it looks orange when you put it on , you 're using too much this is n't tinted moisturizer or foundation ! that said , if you 're familiar with illuminator , you wo n't be put off by the color comparing with others that i 've used , what i like best about liquid light is just that it 's really the lightest illuminator i 've ever tried it absorbs immediately and feels great it leaves a subtly smooth , satiny texture to your skin , and does n't there or look filmy at all it 's high on the reflecting particles , which i'm not too fond of , but if you 're looking for an illuminator that is part shimmer , this is it one way or another , it does certainly brighten your complexion looks great at a short distance as it really does capture light , so i think this would be great photo makeup as well it all depends on what you 're looking for but if these elements fits your taste , you 'll be quite happy with this product
5	i really like the color choice in this bronzer too often you 're essentially left with one or two shades that no one in could possibly use , but these offer nothing but good choices , at least for me i 've really been able to see a difference between this top of the line bronzer and the cheap drugstore ones it 's pretty seem less to apply and blends well with foundation this is a great bronzer it 's a little pricey , but you 're getting a quality product that should last a long time
5	have used elemis for years
5	makes hands smooth without a touch of oil or grease
1	i bought this product because it is listed as a lotion for rosacea , and dry , sensitive skin it is not a lotion it is a non spray of very watery , milky liquid i am returning this , and would not purchase this again i also do n't like the vendors return policy of return within 7 days of purchase , less fee the return time expires before the product is received , ridiculous
5	i get my nails and toes painted once a month for good measure , but i'm beginning to keep a small essie collection at home , especially for touch ups when i do n't need to spend another 10 on a manicure , or when the manicure tends to chip a day or so after i have real nails , so this is not to offend those with gels , schalack or anything else but real nails just chip faster ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! great bargain and way cheaper than most retail outlet discount chains , including the shipping , if any at all my key west color ! ! \)
2	i have naturally fair skin i spend time in the sun and develop somewhat of a tan but my base is definitely fair this product gave my skin a tone that was definitely more orange than bronze with self tanners you have to be extremely diligent during application or you 'll end up with streaks i got a few streaks from this product but nothing major my biggest issue is the resulting color maybe deeper skin tones would have better luck with this product sadly i ca n't recommend it for fair skin tones
5	i was never really into the expensive nail polishes like essie however , one day i fell in love with a color my friend was wearing it was dj play that song so i asked her if i could borrow it the polish went on very smooth i always were a bottom coat i only had to put 2 coats on to achieve the desired color i loved it ! ! i am a faithful fan of essie now , with dj play that song as my most favorite polish color it is a slight neon purple color , however not to bold i have it on my toes now and receive tons of compliments
5	first dry shampoo tried , takes out grease and leaves a dry finish not really scented , so really comfortable to use because the product is powder instead of liquid , there 's no alcohol in the mix to spray
3	product is fine other than the shade i have very light skin and it looks like i have dirt on my face i use a very light hand and still does n't look great
5	i love mario badescu products ! i have combination skin and use this on particularly oily days very nice , gentle and a little goes a long way
5	absolutely wonderful so far i have not gotten one baxter product i did not think was simply excellent and at a fair price something i like about this one is a little bit of it goes a long way and does the job always leaving you feeling fresh
4	this was an easy to apply concealer , and a little goes a fairly long way do n't overdo i 've been testing it for about a week , with or without foundation and or powder it does cover a fair amount of my facial redness and age spots , but not so heavy i feel weighted down and greasy my skin gets a bit dry when any type of makeup is applied , and i had better results if i applied this immediately after applying moisturizer instead of waiting a couple of minutes for that to set in it does n't cover everything , but every little bit helps with me it is n't a miracle worker by any means , but it does help
3	good
3	like this lip pencil
4	when i gave this tube a squeeze , i was surprised at the relative of the product i was expecting a thick creme that i would have to rub between my hands until it was warm thin enough to work through my thick , eastern european , too long , wavy hair \( trust me , it can be an unruly mess \) so , already i was impressed then , i caught the light fragrance it 's a little perfume y in a really good way so , i worked a moderate amount through my hair , stacked it in a bun and pinned it there for about an hour and , man , when i it , that gorgeous fragrance just me super appealing ! now , the first time , i make the mistake of combing my hair it gain about double the volume and looked insane the second time i used it , i ran my fingers through my hair instead and , ! beautiful , loose , defined curls as well as volume therefore , you may wish to skip the comb brush and , soft \? oh my gosh , each curl is genuinely touchable y soft my boyfriend just loves touching my hair what a nice bonus ! not only does this smell heavenly , but the overall look is gorgeous ! genuinely recommended !
5	diptyque , , and candles are all in regular rotation in my home if you are a candle snob , this one 's on par with the rest of them in terms of fragrance composition , sillage , and quality i 'd classify as a clean , green , not too sweet , fruity floral if you 're a fan , this scent falls within that family but who is ovando \? well , she 's one of the top floral designers in nyc known for artistic , , flower i live right by the ovando boutique and it 's total of a more like an art walk into the dark , black , mysterious to see curved of and like minimalist yet lush , ovando are a staple at high profile events around the city for that reason just do a quick google image search i'm so glad to see ovando extend her brand into fragrance products no other major floral designer has done that since , whose perfumes are still highly regarded , though discontinued beautifully boxed , this candle makes a great gift to someone who appreciates high end candles or is into flowers floral design priced to compete with other luxury candles , this is not for the person who 's into bath body or candles they may not appreciate it at first but if you want open their world into the beautiful world of luxury candles , it 's a great starting point
4	works well over the am moisturizer it 's thin and not greasy i like the added tint
5	of all the aftershave products i 've tried this is the one i always come back to my barber \( who i occasionally go to for a shave too \) tells me that it 's drying because its a gel she 's probably right , but i love the cooling menthol ness of it nonetheless i 'll keep buying it until they stop making it
4	there is clearly more marketing than product going on with this baxter of california night cream it is marketed as a night cream for men , and everything about it is designed to appeal to the masculine , and convince the that putting on a night cream before sleep wo n't un man you the marketing claims that mens skin is different from womens , and this product is specifically formulated for me im not sure that i buy that both my wife and i tried this night cream out , and i cant say that there was any perceivable difference it works aha formula cleans off the dried skin overnight , and is especially welcome during cold and windy winters it is a thick cream , almost like a mask , which is odd if you have n't tried it before it comes out almost like toothpaste , which was a shock at first but it blends into the skin nicely all in all , we are pleased with the results the biggest bonus for this night maybe why it is targeted for that it is entirely odor free i like that i do n't want any scents in my product , especially for a night cream if you are interested in natural products , then baxter of california is not for you the ingredients lists is full of dimethicone and parabens and glycol and that sort of thing
5	this is my second purchase of this item i started with the smaller tube just to see if i liked it i really liked it but did not like the tube when your hands are wet , it is a bit too difficult to open and then it just comes pouring out before i even finished the tube , i had to have the big bottle with the pump dispenser it is so much easier like others have mentioned , it does not dry your skin out at all that is a huge plus for me put some in the sink with a hand towel and make sure the entire towel has soaked it up into the until hot lay in the tub and wrap the towel around your face just make sure you do not as you will get very relaxed and fall asleep when the towel comes off , use the daily face cleaner your face will thank you
5	a necessity for random breakouts ! !
4	i really like this liquid foundation it goes on well , it feels nice on my face , it smooths evenly , i think it looks good i did n't break out after using it either , as is often the case with new makeup the only problem i had with this is figuring out what color im supposed to get i typically get the 2nd to lightest color in a foundation spectrum this one , sand , is a 3 , but im not sure if that is 3rd lightest or 3rd darkest \( their 1 is ivory so maybe 3rd lightest \? but then their 5 looks lighter than the sand but then the large color swatches all look the same to me \) the color of the container is much lighter than the actual liquid , which is more like yeah , sand however , it looks darker when it comes out , its a bit lighter than that when you actually put it on it works for me , as long as i blend into my hairline and my neck well , but i would have been better off with a lighter shade
3	this polish is watery way more so then the other colors maybe its a fake i do n't know i should have bought in store
4	this is likely the most luxurious lipstick i have ever tried i previously did not have a brand , i 've used loreal , max factor , lancme , and este lauder with no real favor to a brand , just the color i 've had such dry lips recently , chapstick , , and my other lipsticks just were n't working in the moisturizing category , let alone keeping any added color on my dry lips this does ! and my lips feel silky and nourished , this particular color , whitney is a bit more in the pink white brightened pigments than i care for \( very spring like and probably better on a lighter blonde , i'm a red head , so i , as i usual have to applied a much darker shade and blended a bit to make it a wearable color for me honestly this lipstick feels wonderful on i have just ordered a second , darker color , more my usual color i gave this four stars because the color came out quite a bit lighter than what was pictured here on amazon , whitney is a very pink shade overall the lipstick itself is velvety smooth , holds color very well and feels wonderful on my lips
5	i love this product and i received it very quickly
3	this is a tough product to review because it worked pretty well for me but not well for my wife i have olive skin , my wife is fair with some freckles we both tried it my results were pretty good , leaving me with a pretty natural looking color my wife , on the other hand , was not as lucky her color did not look so natural , and more orangey not pumpkin like , but not natural it smells pretty good and skin does not feel dry i used the tanning mitt and it left no streaks my wife used it , and also , no streaks one of the other problems was that everything darkens , so if you are hoping to blend freckles , dark spots , etc , it 's not really going to happen at this price , i would expect a lot more , and while it worked for me , it 's not something i would buy
3	works well but very woody scented
5	gave it as a gift they love it
4	high medium to full coverage lasted well after setting with powder i would recommend that you go into a store and try on shades before buying the description , swatches , and the dermablend website are not helpful note theres a significant jump in color from one shade to the next , either going lighter or darker and , you really need to apply this and wait a few minutes to see if the color works after it has had a chance to interact with your body chemistry and heat all foundations will settle to their true colors after being on the skin for a few minutes the shade i bought was it did turn darker once set on my face i can make it work but i wished there was a good shade match
4	i was eager to try this getting the tape off of it so i could try it was so frustrating that i was almost too to try it but i'm glad i did it goes on super easy much easier than other similar products it looks very natural i'm very pleased with it
3	it could be that this just is n't the right choice for me i do n't want to come as close to burning myself as i have when using this yes , its nice to have the glove to prevent serious and burns but id rather not have to rely on it to prevent injury i guess i just like the older , less challenging style of curling iron better yes , it takes longer to get the job done but its safer ultimately , that matters a lot to me
5	i have been performing the cnd shellac process on my nails at home for approximately six months i have been using this color on my nails for most of that time when i chose to send the entire cnd process to my daughter as a gift , this is the color i chose because it was such a lovely color she is loving it also i would categorize this color more as a pink orange rather than a true orange color as the photo indicates i have found it to be long wearing as are all the shellac colors personally , i like to have a matching regular nail polish to use for touch ups just in case i get a flaw in the shellac process before i have time to redo my nails i have found the sally diamond strength something new to work quite well with the tropix color as an added note i have read where lots of women are purchasing other brands of gel uv colors to mix and match with the cnd shellac process however , i recently read where the cnd shellac products actually have tiny in the polishes after curing that allow the solar oil to penetrate to the nail for other brands do not have this process i had considered other brands to have some variety in the color choices but have decided to stick with the entire process being the cnd brand also , six new colors are coming out for fall 2012 and those colors can be viewed on several blogs by doing a search for them
5	i sleep with a and , consequently , there are mornings where i wake up with a line , or lines , on my face due to my sleeping position during the night these sometimes stay with me all morning and the appearance is n't very flattering i 've used this cream a few nights now and those lines have been gone by the time i have morning coffee since i began using the cream it does n't take much , goes on nicely , and there is virtually no fragrance with this face cream so far , so good i like this stuff very much
3	no effect at all waste of money i already switched avon

2	i 'd been using a cleansing oil from neutrogena that performs relatively well , but i was on the hunt for something better something that would remove makeup , not strip all of the moisture out of my skin , and most importantly , would not make my sensitive skin break out it is kind of disconcerting to see that the product so thoroughly \( and quickly \) separates , though that is remedied by a good shaking i very much appreciate that the product is virtually scentless , since heavily fragranced products tend to be pore clogging , at least in my experience i 've used this a few times and in a couple of different ways , at this point first , i tried to use it in a manner that followed the directions , in terms of putting the oil on a cotton ball and going from there the problem i had with that was that it felt as though too much of the product soaked into the cotton , and not enough made its way onto my face on subsequent uses , i just decided to put the oil in my hands and then massage it all over my face , concentrating on my eye area , and using that method was a double edged sword it did a better job , but far too much of the oil had to be used in terms of performance , it 's not great , but it 's okay it removes face makeup relatively well , but it to take off mascara and eyeliner i have to make at least two full , lengthy passes over my eyes whenever i use this , and even then , it leaves so much residue under my eyes and on my lashes , and the eye makeup that i use is n't even waterproof here are the reasons that this product is not so great even after wiping the excess off of my face \( using tissue or toilet paper \) and rinsing with warm water , it leaves so much oil behind that my skin feels way too greasy even after i go back in and use a cleanser , a lot of that residue remains and it 's not pleasant making matters worse is that after each time i 've used this , i 've broken out i'm just not a fan of this product because of how it makes my skin feel afterward , how little of my eye makeup it removes , and the fact that it clogs my pores like nobody 's business adding to injury is the price , which is outrageous i just cannot recommend this , because there are so many better performing products out there at a fraction of this price
5	a true fushia which is really hard to find very nice formular coverage is good and the color is wow !
4	this does a decent job of covering most bruises i have multiple and do a bang up job of falling and into things because of bad balance so i often have bruises on my arms and legs this coverage product covers most of them up pretty well and at least tones the really nasty ones down enough so people are n't and asking where i got that one great for covering age spots and birthmark too
5	muy bueno
5	always a fan of lr p and in my quest for a neutral cleansing bar for the body , this really fits the bill i love it i need a cleansing bar that does n't dry or irritate my skin and this fits the bill !
2	this was very thick and sticky it does not move well at all it might just be me but i think it is a little too dark as well i personally would not buy this again
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	great set of gentle skin care products for or allergy prone adults would be a perfect baby shower gift , classy yet useful
5	really good
4	so , this stuff smells really awesome i love how clean and fresh this is the other remover i usually use stings my eyes but i did not notice that with the vichy , which was a huge plus i thought for sure this was going to leave my eyes super greasy and oily but i was wrong i had no problems with this makeup remover i use this to remove my eyeliner , mascara , and eye shadow it removed everything pretty quickly i always hold the wet cotton pad up to my eye and let is sit for a few seconds before swiping everything off i try to let the cleaner sink in and do its magic before i try to rub everything off and this worked really well better than my old remover in fact i was pretty much in love from the second i got a whiff of the fragrance and the way it cleans just put it way over the top for me the thing that always gets me is the price of remover i mean , dang i do n't use makeup a lot and i'm starting to understand why i ca n't afford it that being said , this is only 6 more than my previous eye makeup remover so for me it 's worth it it works faster and with less irritation
4	the feel is sort of in between a lotion and a serum takes a decent amount of massaging to work the moisturizer in to your skin skin definitely feels very soft and moisturized after application scent is mild , very slightly tart , and pleasant not overpowering at all
4	my gf liked it a lot it absorbs right into the skin without irritating it there is no scent to it which is great if you have sensitive skin bottle is a lot smaller than i had imagined
5	this delivers just the right amount of color natural it stays on and makes my lips stay moist i have several of these , in my bag , in my desk , in my cosmetic bag i have tried hundreds is lip balms over the years and this is the best one i have ever tried this is a must have
5	i look forward to washing my face with this every day it gently removes makeup and oil without leaving my face feeling stripped it has a fresh scent that reminds me of lily of the valley it 's fairly thick and the dispenser is easy to control , so the bottle should last for several weeks i have combination skin so this provides just the right amount of oil removal without leaving my skin feeling dry or causing my skin to break out
5	i use this product everyday when i want to give my roots a little lift it works great and does not leave white residue it package arrived quickly and was in perfect condition i would recommend this seller , and buy from them again in the future !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	this is a very nice product that goes on nice and smooth and is absorbed quickly it did seem to moisturize and soothe dry skin well i found that just a little bit covers a fairly wide area of skin after several days of wearing this product , my skin , which is mostly on the dry side , did feel smooth and soft it does have smell sort of sweet , but not exactly which disappears pretty after the product is applied my reservations about this product are the price and the fact that it has some kind of blue coloring recommended to those who are okay with both
5	product received on time love the color !
4	this is one of my favorite hairsprays i have fine thinning hair and it is not too heavy yet holds my hair in place i have used it exclusively for 6 years or so i have one complaint about 3 out of 12 cans of spray i have purchased quit spraying and most are still full i have cleaned the tip and it still does not work i have returned these to my stylist for replacement it was recommended to keep the cap on top of the canister when not in use to avoid this problem i always do this and it did n't seem to help in these cases otherwise , a great spray
5	patch love this formula ! ! ! i was in a rush and only used one coat looks amazing imo dried soooo fast im hooked definitely buying more colors
5	i was introduced to the obagi skin care line for the first time at the medical office i immediately liked it and i used it any time i can find the product at the affordable price i like buy product online because often times prices are better than buying the product at the medical spas at the retail price i particularly like vitamin c serum vitamin c is a great antioxidant and this king of l ascorbic acid comes in a 15 strength it is important to mention that obagi offer 4 different types of this serum they come in professional rx strength , 10 , 15 and 20 strength packaging for the 15 strength is very specific in stating not to mix professional rx strength with 15 strength i use this serum in the morning and at night in the evening , when i have more time , i like to mix this serum with pure hyaluronic acid for additional moisture for the skin the other convenience of this product is that it comes with the enclosed it helps control of how much product can be used on the skin i apply it on both face and neck and then i follow up with the moisturizer from the same line during daytime i also apply spf to protect skin from damaging uv rays great product my skin loves it the other advantage is that this product is compatible with any skin type
5	the daily oribe conditioner is amazing ! it does n't over condition the hair , can be used in very small amounts and smells great ! i love using it and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a light , daily conditioner
4	this is a very lightweight hair cream it has only a slight scent of peppermint or spice , it 's a little antiseptic but in a clean and fresh and not chemical way i rub a small \( 1 2 inch \) bit into my hands and then into my hair and it does a fine job holding my style all day no frizz , and my hair does n't feel stiff or waxy however , i have pretty short , and wavy hair this would n't work for something that needs a lot of hold washes out clean , with no build up i wish it was n't so expensive
5	la roche posay 's eye makeup remover works fantastically well i 've used other products that do a good job removing eyeliner and eye shadow , but require some scrubbing to get all the mascara off \( and i do n't even wear waterproof mascara \) this stuff removes even mascara ! there 's no detectable odor and the product does n't burn or sting the first time i used , it a cotton ball and got some of this stuff in one of my eyes it produced a slight sting , nothing extreme since then , i 've been more moderate in the amount i use and have no irritation the skin around my eyes feels soft and clean , not dried out or oily there does n't seem to be any residue left from this makeup remover you have to shake the bottle to combine two distinct layers of solution and they do separate again almost immediately i remove the lid , place a cotton ball over the open top , shake , and immediately squeeze some onto the cotton ball by the time i set the bottle down , the layers are pretty much separated again , it 's that quick definitely recommend update i had to stop using this product i began to get painful styes on my eyelids as soon as one would go away , another would appear i 've never had this issue in my life , and the only thing i could think of was that the oily nature of this remover was causing the leading to styes even though i always followed up use of this product with a good face washing , i suspect the eye makeup remover was the cause of the styes i stopped using this several months ago and have n't had a since it does n't seem like this is an issue for anyone else in reading the reviews , so i am not changing my rating just sharing the experience i had when using this product
5	this is my new signature fall polish ! ! love this color ! it looks black , but in the light there is some shiny wine undertones
5	i had seen the marvis toothpastes before and always wondered why in the world anyone would spend a 10 dollars on a toothpaste that was until recently when an order i had placed on the web included a tiny sample tube of the original nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href marvis classic strong mint toothpaste dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 marvis classic strong mint toothpaste a every night \( and day \) i found myself reaching for that one rather than my old toothpaste \( which shall remain \) because i loved the strong mint flavor and the overall clean and fresh feeling in my mouth i was intrigued and went on to google marvis that 's when i found out about the jasmin mint flavor and a bit ordered the smaller travel size , just in case i would n't like what seemed like a strange combination of flowery and minty however , i am very happy to report that this is a truly great flavor the mint is not quite as strong as in the original but that 's just as well since it enables the taste buds to actually notice the jasmine which tastes exactly like jasmine tea and is perfectly balanced with the mint not icky , not yucky , not strange , not artificial , just extremely pleasant and wonderfully unique who would have thought that brushing one 's teeth can actually be an experience and not just something one does because it must be done i , for one , am hooked and plan to next order the big tube and simply ignore the fact that it is really crazy to spend 10 dollars on a toothpaste \)
3	first off , mine arrived , in lots of little pieces and it was all over inside the box for 34 i expect it to come in 1 piece and when i opened it it was a cloud of dust also i did n't like how it covered on my nose it made my pores look large also fine lines , yup you can see them if you apply a heavy coat of it but it was fine after a few times of trying to use it , still regardless my pores look noticeable i also strongly recommend a very good moisturizer before applying as it leaves your skin feeling a little on the dry side
4	although this small container seems a little pricey , it should last for a very long time my hair has a lot of natural curl and tends to get frizzy , especially when the humidity is high when i use just a few drops of this product distributed through my wet hair , it and looks better whether i blow dry it or let it dry naturally my advice is to try much less than you think you need rub the drops in your hands and work it through your wet or damp hair so far i have n't made the mistake of applying too much and the tiny amount i 've been using works very well to lessen the worst traits of my hair and seems to work well for heat styling or allowing it to dry curly on its own
5	i absolutely love obagi products and this sunscreen lotion is no exception ! it is and light so you can apply your makeup afterwards and it will not feel heavy or oily ! i used to use peter thomas matte sunscreen but this blows it away !
5	opi makes the best nail polish by far and there colors are always beautiful and come out with a solid shiny vibrant finish
5	i have sensitive skin so any time i use one of these facial products i'm rolling the dice with whether i 'll end up with a breakout or not this product is great on my sensitive skin though after i 've used the mask my skin feels really clean the smell is intense but i can live with it for this nice mask i 'd suggest this mask to anyone looking for a nice refreshing facial mask that is safe on sensitive skin
4	bought this in combination with the face powder i like the pump bottle you do have to wipe it clean after each application to prevent buildup of the product that is no it blends easily
5	this is , by far , the best moisturizer i 've used for my dry gray hair i live in a place with little humidity in the air , and it really takes a toll on my hair , but oribe adds moisture and shine it 's pricy , to be sure , but it 's worth it , and the smell is fabulous
5	love this color !
3	juice beauty blemish clearing cleanser is a good cleanser , but not one i can use every day with my combination skin everyday use was far too drying for my skin type i found it to be most effective when used several times a week and only on the areas of my face that are oily and prone to blemishes i like that it does n't contain harsh chemicals and is made from natural ingredients it has a mild scent but for the most part it 's fragrance free for skin in need of a deep cleansing , this would be a good product to try
5	i 've used mary kay cosmetics for years and never really considered using a tinted moisturizer for a foundation until recently when i 've down my daily makeup routine to the minimum the cosmetic foundations have really good coverage and all kinds of gimmicks \( instant color match ! \) but i find that as i 've gotten older my skin is drier and less absorbent so my foundation goes on less smoothly and requires more blending and my skin feels dry after i'm done the jouer solves these issues with a creamy application , minimal blending and fussing and good coverage plus a softer feel after it 's applied i use two small pea sized blobs on my face and it covers everything i also like it as a spot concealer on days i do n't feel like a full application and it blends nicely on problem spots also , it has a very faint , nice fragrance , nothing overpowering or annoying to smell all day i did n't expect to really love this product , but i'm sold on it
4	this is a very nice , creamy moisturizer which does live up to its name , and is a good cream during the winter months despite being thick and moisturizing , i 've had no issues using it during the day \( though it does n't have any sunscreen in it \) it helps with the dry , cold weather affecting my skin and does n't bother my makeup at all the only thing is this is a very small jar of makeup it is lasting me a good while because this is such a creamy , potent moisturizer , but be aware that this is less than an ounce of product \( that 2 4 ounces is mostly the glass jar \) it 's a small size so good for traveling , but not for a long term product hence why it does n't cost much still , this is helping with dry skin and has n't caused any adverse reactions
1	the lipstick was broken when i got it so now i can only apply it with my finger most of it was broken off in the lid bummer
5	this is a very light oil that absorbs well into facial skin and does not leave any sort of oily feel or residue it has a lovely , light flowery scent , which i also enjoy i am using it as a night moisturizer and also under foundation it leaves the skin feeling smooth and silky i have sensitive skin , small pores , and classic t zone so i using it on my forehead this definitely compares quite favorably with other high end products so far i am liking this immensely if anything changes i will update this review
5	i love black polish in the summer time i love it in the fall i love it in the winter i love it in the spring ! this is a very nice black not goopy !
5	two thumbs up , it really leaves your skin hydrated an excellent mask for sensitive skin
5	excellent color ! it literally goes well with any season ! i bought it for the summer but it looks fantastic so i will be wearing this all year long if you have n't tried the essie brand you 're completely missing out !
3	i kind of went on a baxter shopping and purchased almost their complete line of products , this included i never used to use face cream or moisturizer , but after trying this the first time , i may continue to do so this made my face really smooth and soft , without feeling oily has a pleasant smell too it is a little pricey , but i think it will last a long time i am very happy with baxter products update i have used this for over one month and i do n't think i even notice a difference it definitely feels nice and smooth while it is on my face , but after i wash it off in the morning , i see no difference i have actually broken out in a few places on my face and am not sure if it is from this i will not buy again , too expensive for the lack of results
5	what did we every do before product showed up on the web \? what did companies do before the internet when they wanted to a product so their product would sell better \? i just love it when i find a product that has reviews and then some comes along and it in their review they never fail to mention the name of a better product when this happens , i find that i am to buy the product to see if the has any i will begin by saying that i have no to jack black at all i do use a few of their products i was a huge fan of almost anything made by zirh , but their three step shaving system became just too time consuming that is when i heard about jack black 's beard lube after trying it , i was converted i got the same shave with much less fuss and it cut my shaving time by at least 5 minutes i still use zirh face products like correct , protect and they are exceptional the jack black face scrub is painful anyway , even though i have not run out of my current supply of beard lube , i ordered this shave cream i used it for the first time about 30 minutes ago this stuff is remarkable ! it takes a bit more effort to apply than beard lube \( i do not own 200 shaving brushes \) but i worked up a good lather with just my fingers as soon as i began to move the razor against my skin , i actually had to stop because i thought i had forgotten to install a blade we are talking about an entire weekend 's worth of stubble and the blade went through it with no pulling of any kind without exaggerating one , this was the closest , , most comfortable shave i have ever had rest assured readers , if you are considering this product , buy it ! you will not be sorry as for the , well , i cannot help you i hope you spent the 10 00 you got paid to post your review for something worthwhile
5	this is a great lightweight dryer that has the perfect amount of heat for my thick , coarse hair it dries so much faster than my old dryer , it 's almost unbelievable it only takes me about 15 minutes to get the perfect blowout the ions really help eliminate the frizz , even in my somewhat wavy , frizz prone hair it 's also super quiet and i really notice the difference i dry my hair most of the way using high heat and then finish with the medium setting the concentrator nozzle works great and helps me get very smooth locks i really appreciate the fact that this dryer is so much lighter than my old one my arm does n't get at all when i use it this is my first bio ionic dryer and so far i'm really pleased with it it has all the features that i want coupled with the light weight and the fact that it 's so quiet , which makes it a pleasure to use in the past , i 've only purchased cheap dryers and have truly never been happy with their performance all of them were heavy and extremely so this bio ionic dryer is a welcome change the old dryers never really controlled the frizz and my hair always felt really dry and damaged because it would take forever for my hair to dry this bio ionic dryer will save a lot of wear and tear on my hair because it dries it so fast it takes me less than half the time it used to i 've had this dryer for about 2 months and am really pleased with my purchase it 's definitely been worth every penny my hair is smooth with tons of volume and it now takes me almost no time at all to dry it , even though it 's pretty thick and heavy i definitely recommend this dryer for anyone with my hair type
2	i used bliss triple oxygen radiant protection serum for about a week and while i did n't notice any visible results to my fine lines , i did start to experience breakouts i have not tried the product again to confirm that the bliss serum was indeed the culprit of the sudden breakout but since discontinuing use of the product my skin has returned to normal perhaps i'm sensitive to one of the numerous ingredients this serum contains because ii do n't typically have problem skin i'm a little suspicious of whatever makes this serum look so orange and shimmery the serum has a faint orange fragrance , which is not unpleasant , and it felt okay when applied to my skin , but it practically glows when it 's dispensed from the pump i'm not sure why the manufacturer included all the color and shimmer because the product goes on as if it 's translucent it may be a fabulous product for others but it did not work well for me
5	great hand lotion soaks right in and leaves skin super soft no greasy residue , great scent !
5	soooooo clean without stripping ! the warning about not getting it in your eyes is a one i use this 3 times a week i 've been looking for a clarifying shampoo since fekkai 'd theirs and found a far better one
5	i purchased this for my son who has acne prone skin and he really likes this says it heals and soothes and does not break him out
5	yes its 20 but i spend more on lite in 1 happy hour and this bottle lasts a few months it does n't have any harsh chemicals so its great for my sensitive skin their gentle skin cleanser is ok but i like this exfoliater better because it seems to scrub off more dead skin cells and prevent more ingrown hairs sometimes it makes my forehead dry if i scrub too much so be careful if you 're looking to prevent zits i 've found stress and diet \( no greasy oily sugary foods or products ! \) have more of an effect than face wash in my case just try eating healthy clean for a week or 2 and you 'll notice clearer skin ! shaving let me save you years of trial and error take a warm shower wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser , shave afterwards with a 50 merkur safety razor handle with good blades \( save 100 's on mach 3 refills ! \) , use a 20 tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond \( or proraso \) shaving cream \( you can let it set in a minute \) , shave with the grain down , slowly , softly \( do n't press hard let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting \) , lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry ! say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs forever ! trust me i 've tried dozens of pricey face washes , shaving creams , and after shaves over the last 4 years if you do n't want to commit so much money yet order the pre post shave proraso cream online , buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works \( under their c o bigelow label \) then get the cheap single blade disposables \( mach 3 's are too aggressive \) at a grocery store and you 'll notice a difference overnight
2	i should have known it was a bad sign when the box came completely open and destroyed thankfully everything inside was still wrapped so i decided to give it a try anyway within a few days i saw my skin get redder and more sensitive than it ever was before i do n't know if there 's something in the products i was allergic to , but i had to quit it
4	vibrant color !
2	had high hopes for this perricone product and was again disappointed apparently , his products do not work for me i have a good complexion and thought that this would work as i do n't need want a lot of coverage the color is too orangey brown and not a universal color at all it also has a rather stickey feel to it after applying if the product worked the money would not be an issue but when it does n't , the money is the issue too costly for such a mediocre product would not recommend this to anyone
5	i love the shellac system as a whole and this polish is no exception depending on the lighting sometimes it looks like a light purple , other times a great taupe color i have fair skin and the color is perfect i 've also just tried layering it over the dark lava and it makes a great dark grey purple like other reviewers said , you do need two coats of this but i 've found that with most of the shellac color 's
5	it was over a week before they began to chip
3	this is not the usual calvin klein fragrance in fact , this fragrance is downright different from pretty much all fragrance on the market it has a very salty and peppery scent salty as in sea salt to my nose that ocean scent then there is a very big wood sandalwood that lasts the entire way thru there is also a powdery musk undertone but it is not too strong i really did not like this the first time i tried it that sea salt was funky in a bad way to my nose i tried it again after i smelled it in the air on someone else it smelled good i recognized it immediately once i got home i sprayed again it was better but i do n't think this is really my kind of scent but i have a large sample , so will try again maybe it will grow on me \) i tend to like more white flower scents but i also like to explore try new things sillage is arm length beyond so go easy with the spray this lasts about 8 hours on my skin
5	product description states that this shampoo is good for thin , fine hair in need of volume that 's my hair thin fine limp unattractive needs one or two volumizing products just to look normal with this shampoo , i'm one step ahead as soon as i 've shampooed it as well as any one after shampoo product leaves my hair shiny and easy to style lathered well rinsed easily i'm going to order the conditioner and see how they work together i am not wild about the scent to me , it seems woodsy and masculine but i do love the effect on my hair
5	great
4	while it works , well enough , its not my favorite neck complex it does an okay job at moisturizing , but i did n't notice much difference in the texture of the neck it also stays a little greasy , which is fine at night but means i do n't reach for it during the day and while it did do a wonderful job of evening out my skin tone , which was great , leaving my skin more luminous with less tiny sun spots , i still felt like my skin was the smell was off putting the first couple of times i used it , which i appreciate that it 's not perfumed the chemical smell was a little weird but , either i got used to the smell or it dissipates more quickly after each use , because i did n't notice it nearly as much after day three i did have the red neck reaction it warns about on the package \( always a good reason to read the instructions on anything before use ! \) it did n't burn or itch , it was just that my skin was a vibrant red i use this neck complex at night , so it did n't bother me , \( a little to see , yes \) , and my skin did get used to it and does n't do that any more when i apply it the texture of the cream itself is thick and firm think of it more like a neck balm , but applies without tugging i think for the product size and price i want something a little more moisturizing and luxurious but , i'm glad to have tried this and will probably replace it when i run out if i have n't found another suitable replacement
3	i make an effort to purchase unscented products , so i 've tried a lot of them of all the unscented products i 've tried , this is the most unscented unless i my nose in my hands after i 've used it , i ca n't smell anything at all the cream comes out thick , but as soon as i start to spread it around , it softens and spreads very easily , so a little goes a long way it makes my skin feel soft and hydrated without feeling greasy i like this product it works well and i appreciate that it 's unscented , but it does n't work any better than other lotions and creams i 've used that are less expensive if scented products are a problem for you , this is the way to go if not , you 'd do just as well to purchase something that 's less costly
5	honestly , this is the best self tanner i 've ever used , and i gave up after trying most brands ! having tried several other of the brands' self tanners , vita liberata has some ok products , but nothing i wanted to spend a small fortune on this self tanner blew all of them out of the water ! i am fair skinned , and my legs are as white as paper in the summer , i really want some color on them , but from a burn was n't what i had in mind that 's why i go for self tanners , to give my legs some life i 've tried other tanners \( including ones from this brand \) , and nothing worked as well or as easily as this it goes on clear , and the color develops gradually , without a hint of the dreaded oompa loompa orange that 's the curse of too many self tanning products it really looks like a tan , but it 's light and natural very realistic ! i also love that it lasts a good long while , and it fades gradually like a tan ! just remember to exfoliate well first , and do n't apply any moisturizers for at least a day before you self tan trust me , you will love this !
4	this has a very light , fresh scent that dissipates , and is probably not going to attract bugs like some it is slippery when put on wet hair but dries to a nice , natural finish a little dab 'll do ya , too , or you will get the greasies it does n't stick the hair together it is more like a volumizing control product nice
5	this has to be by far the best yet least expensive such product ever created in just 3 4 days of use nightly you see a remarkable difference in your skin it dries up any break outs , smooths texture , exfoliates dead skin , and makes your skin look younger and smoother you could pay hundreds of dollars in treatments and not get the results such as this product gives for 2 months for practically nothing a winner a must have guy or girl
1	creases like crazy !
4	this is a great lotion containing glycolic and lactic acid it absorbs very well and helps my skin exfoliate it stung a bit the first few times i applied it but then my skin became accustomed to it i do find it a bit odd that it is meant to be applied in the am , rather than the pm i thought lotions like this are applied at night and then a morning scrub is used to help get rid of dead skin however , i have been using it according to the directions and it has been working great my skin looks youthful and it absorbs nicely so that my makeup goes on with no problems
5	good color , i love it
4	i into a bunch of butter london lipsticks a few months ago when they were on sale those lipsticks were quite nice , but this new iteration , plush rush , is a step above it 's got a new case this one is a sleek black with a magnetic closure the lipstick is lightly scented , rather reminiscent of guerlain 's signature scent it 's not very strong , and i find it pleasant the thing with this lipstick is a claim to make lips plumper , something i'm all for in this regard , though , the effect is quite mild you ca n't even really feel it until you smack your lips together , and even then , your smile is n't going to into kylie jenner suffice it to say the effect , like the tingly sensation , is muted but the color of the lipstick is really pretty it 's fairly well saturated , in a lips but sort of color my lips are highly pigmented , so a color like this is actually lighter than my natural lip color even so , this lipstick covers my natural pigmentation , which is actually unique ! i usually have to resort to a lip foundation if i want to go , because my lip color just anything that 's lighter the color has pretty good staying power for a cream , and it 's very comfortable to wear you will need to reapply during the day , but it leaves a pretty stain on your lips after normal lipstick wear and tear the price for a high quality lipstick is n't unreasonable kat von d 's matte lipsticks are 21 , and another favorite , bite beauty , are 26 , so at 22 , butter london 's is definitely in the upper tier ballpark definitely worth the money !
5	i have been trying water based facial moisturizers for the summertime , particularly when my skin feels kind of dry ones i use in fall winter are a bit too heavy when it 's hot and humid so far i am liking the vichy aqualia thermal mineral water gel facial moisturizer quite a lot it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and i'm not having trouble with small breakouts clogged pores i have normal combination skin and anything too oily usually causes small breakouts after a week or so , particularly in the summertime this has a light , pleasant scent and a little seems to go a long way it does feel instantly cooling i 've been using it in the mornings for a day cream i find it to be effective
1	this turns my lips the ugly pink i threw the box away otherwise id return it
4	this was my first order of the mario badescu facial spray and i am pleased to say i like it quite a lot i use it during the day but find it especially useful on warm evenings i like to lightly spritz all of my skin before bed this allows me to rest comfortably in the breeze it also hydrates all of my skin and not just my face i love the smell and the ingredients hydrate my skin and do not leave me overly sticky or uncomfortable feeling the smell is also pleasing to my husband it smells simply like rose water but it has added ingredients that my other rose water orders do not have it is a well made product and with several months use of the spray , i still have half a bottle left with liberal use i was somewhat hesitant to order the spray but am now glad i did if you are looking for a really well made rose water i think you will be happy with this
5	this was a fairly long lasting bar with a nice , refreshing scent and a nice lather by long lasting i mean it does n't melt away in the shower quickly like some glycerin soaps this soap does n't leave an overpowering scent on your body and washes off clean baxter 's cleansing bar is an item i would order again
4	i like the color
5	i was really hesitant \( event doubtful \) that this product was going to work everyone was recommending it and every article i read about skin care was saying this was a product i only have the occasional whitehead , some blackheads on my chin and nose , but i have sebaceous on my nose and my chin this product did not work for blackheads and did not work for sebaceous \( but it 's not supposed to \) i did have one pimple under the skin , and it was starting to hurt but since it had n't broken through the skin it was n't visible i put this on and in the morning it was gone just gone ! like where 'd you go ! \? ! \? so do i recommend this product yes but you just have to understand it 's not meant to work on all acne issues
5	i have oily skin it foams nicely and cleans very well and leaves your face feeling refreshed i will try other elta md products now
3	price aside , this curler works as well as my favorite tarte curler there 's nothing particularly innovative here in fact , it 's pretty utilitarian likewise , i'm dubious about its selling point \( gimmick \? \) of lash conditioning with blue chamomile like other reviewers , i tried to locate replacement pads here , and could find none then i checked on georgie 's website , none there either since this aspect is what draws the attention of the consumer , it seems sage to offer a three pack of replacement pads for a premium why not \? it saves consumers from tossing wasting a perfectly good device \( i wipe mine down with alcohol about one every two weeks \) and allows georgie to on their claims as in , these pads are so great , you 'll want to pick up extra ! as it stands , with no replacement parts to be found and it 's perfectly average performance , i would say this is a solid three star product it 's okay but there are cheaper , equally as effective curlers out there
5	holy moisture ! living in colorado 's dry climate , i find that i really need moisture especially in the winter this strivectin sd advanced intensive concentrate is just that moisture ! major moisture ! i 've been using this cream for well over 2 weeks and have been pleasantly surprised with the results skin feels softer , dryness has been greatly and the overall tone of my skin has evened out price tag is hefty but once i started using this , i have n't purchased the 2 bottles of cream i was using \( day night \) prior so overall this is a must for dry skin \( ca n't speak to someone with more oily skin \) !
5	the best acne face wash i have ever used i will forever repurchase holy grail !
4	both my wife and daughter give this cleanser toner high marks for its ability to clean without drying out their face i'm told it cleans deep without having to really rub the face hard it does a great job of taking off makeup , while there are no noticeable changes to the toning aspect in its name i 'll ding it one star for price 18 seems awfully high to me but hey , i'm a guy that used to use or seabreeze so what do i know
4	this product is reminiscent of the fragrant st ives 's skin products i remember using when i was in high school to my , those were n't considered top of the line by any stretch of the imagination , kind of like suave with regard to shampoo and conditioner while this lotion boasts a list of enticing ingredients \( or lack thereof \) like 10 oils and paraben free , the proof with skin cream is always in the pudding in other words , did i come away feeling as though this helped my skin \? in a word , yes , but i found it best used for arms , legs , neck and chest , but not for the hands or face in fact , the label clearly the label clearly states do not use on the face while i sometimes have issues with eczema on my hands , i found that this product did n't work as well as eucerin hand cream for that in a pinch , however , this served sufficiently in lieu of using no moisturizer on my hands the lotion itself is smooth , with a moderate rose scent to it made in france
5	just incredible ! thanks !
4	my wife tried this i had an unusual experience with this deodorant i really liked the aroma \( very fresh , clean aroma \) , however when applied , it felt wet and took a long time to dry down i did n't love the feeling i ended up giving the deodorant to a family member , thinking maybe i was being too picky , and she loved it ! i should mention that this family member wore it on a hike on with a 4 , 000 gain , and she said it passed the test with flying colors she is sold on this deodorant and plans to wear it regularly ! she was impressed !
2	love opi nail polish this color did not work out for me i was hoping for a sheer peachy pink i have tried applying it several times , with lots of shaking to blend every time i got a streaky look unless i applied enough coats to create an opaque look , which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone
4	i love clarisonic i 've been a loyal user for nearly 3 years and love what it 's done for my skin i have dry , sensitive , acne prone skin \( and am also concerned about aging \) i love how the clarisonic has thoroughly cleaned my skin to keep blemishes at bay , helps with skin radiance , yet does n't irritate my skin i tend to use my clarisonic every other day \( i started out slowly in the beginning and worked my way up until i found the right frequency \) most of the time i use a sensitive , acne , or cashmere brush head since my skin is on the more sensitive side , these softer brush heads work best for me to use regularly but about once a week i 'll use this deep pore brush head for a deeper cleaning either to help with exfoliation or because i 've used more makeup than usual i 've found that once a week it 's a great supplement to a softer brush for my skin type i ca n't imagine using it more frequently than i already do , but for this frequency it 's perfect would recommend
4	as a male , i could n't really test this product on my face since it is supposed to be used under makeup \( i did n't know what primer was until my wife pointed it out \) i let my wife give this a shot and she loved it it absorbs quickly and she says it helps her face feel more refreshed and she feels that it helps make her face look more youthful to be quite i did notice a difference when she first put it on but throughout the day she did look more perky perhaps it was a placebo effect that caused her to smile just a bit more , nonetheless she did look like the same youthful lady i married a decade ago ! !
5	if you like cotton candy pnk ! this is for you my favorite pink essie nail polish of all time !
5	this color is soooooi nice ! i get always compliments every time i have it on my nails i keep buying it , this is my 4 bottle !
4	the foam has a nice texture to it and does a very good job of cleaning it is light and foamy and gives your skin a fresh feel i do n't consider this a makeup remover so do n't have those expectations as some previous reviewers have noted it 's a bit expensive so is it that much better than a cleanser that is , say , half the price \? not really so it price is a concern i 'd say go with the lower price this has a bit of a fragrance which i could do without but as far as the cleansing aspect this does a fine job
5	obagi the best !
5	what a wonderful product ! i use to put deodorant between my thighs to prevent sweating but that left a weird residue and did n't keep me dry this product totally keeps me from sweating and it 's powdery fresh instead of a weird residue !
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	great hand creme the smell is awesome
5	i found this product my daughter 's products , she is very picky so i decided to give it a try i liked enough to order and use in place of my decades long go to product it takes a couple of applications to get the line thick enough , as the brush does not overload when filling in missed spots and it 's good for short strokes it does n't peel , or flake off and lasts for a night out without reapplication
4	toner is not a regular part of my skincare routine i use it occasionally especially after wearing heavy makeup or using sunscreen for some extra cleansing it feels nice going on but does n't seem to provide any long term benefits this toner claims to be different not only does it relax and refresh , it also has anti aging properties the ingredient list is impressive it includes a patented substance called supplamine which is designed to address inflammation , oxidation and glycation as well as fruit and floral extracts including arnica and calendula it can be sprayed directly on clean dry skin and used as a skin freshener throughout the day i must say it is refreshing and my skin feels great after application their is a fragrance that does n't linger the spray is a terrific way to dispense the product , providing enough but not too much it is still early to see results but this does seem to soothe and enhance moisturizer absorption my skin is fairly sensitive and tends to redness and this seems to alleviate the irritation i have not experienced any negative side effects such as break outs or rashes it is too early to realize any anti aging benefits but thus far i am pleased with this product
4	works nicely
5	this looks amazing in sunlight it 's not quite a neon but it 's definitely bright and noticeable i love this color because i 've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink , and this is perfect ! the formula is typical essie kinda gloopy and thick but not too bad
4	this treatment lotion for acne did ok , but not great on my occasional adult acne i was prepared to give it three stars and toss it , but instead gave it to a teen to try it worked better with his teenage skin did n't dry him to a crisp or cause further irritation no one product works for 100 of the people that have the issue the product addresses if you 've been disappointed with other teen young adult acne products , you might consider this obagi lotion
4	only thing my poor acne prone teen uses that does n't irritate his skin a little bit goes a long way
4	a product i use
4	i would do without the glitter in the polish it was a great color and amazing for summer great part of the summer collection
2	very pretty , subtle color goes on easy enough with a scent that i did n't care for at first but diminishes quickly i did n't notice any real enhancement or increase in fullness of my lips and did n't care for the feel of the gloss after applying it i kept rubbing my lips together because i could still feel the gloss on it not crazy about that i want to put the gloss on and forget about it
4	this blush is a very intense color , so you can use very little the compact has no brush , so you 'll need to supply your own , which is fine since you need a larger brush to apply lightly the compact is small , about 2 inches square it is sturdier than most drugstore compacts , so it might travel okay in a purse but when i opened the box it came in , there was powder all over the inside of the box and on the compact , so it does n't seem to be a tight fitting lid i'm leaving it in my makeup box at home the color \( 03 \) is far darker than shown on the screen and leans toward a coral shade , which is n't exactly the right color for me but if it 's your color , this could be a good compact for you
5	excellent product , good for dry skin and aging skin
5	great item
5	nice vibrant color ! a beautfully deep blue i love the quality of essie and how long it lasts worth ever penny ! !
4	i did not get a chance to buy it but if they have will buy it
5	yay ! ! ! love , love , love this color ! i have been dying for a lilac color since spring , and just had n't gotten around to purchasing cnd 's rock royalty and studio white , which one website said was the only way to get a lilac color , and then vexed violette came out ! it 's a little darker than anticipated , which is actually perfect for fall , and i think i can lighten it up for spring with a top coat of and roses fun !
5	i absolutely love this eye shadow kit for daytime ! it goes on easily and stays on well it feels good on the skin the colors are exactly as shown and are very complimentary together
4	this is a makeup brush that is beautiful to hold and feel i thought the flat handle might feel strange compared to the long thin rounded brush handles i am used to , but it feels natural in my hand the bristles are soft and lush feeling the wide rectangular shape gives you a wide flat side for blending but you can also use one of the narrow ends for smaller areas you want to blend good makeup brushes are not cheap , so the price of this \( at least as of the date of this review \) does not seem out of line for comparable brushes the only drawback , and it is minor , is that the size of the handle means i ca n't stick it in the jar where i keep my other makeup brushes because it is too short
5	very easy to apply does n't stay on the brush too much when you put it on looks like it will last a long time i like how the lightest shade is still dark enough that you can use it too often you find contour palettes with such a light shade that it 's basically worthless i 'd get this product again it looks great and is pretty affordable i 've used a few of bliss' products and they 've all been very satisfactory
5	very nice color , perfect coloration
5	as someone who has blond hair i dread the brass that my color can turn this tones it down considerably with giving my hair amazing body , lift and a bit of fullness this makes my hair look fantastic i spend a lot of time outside in the sun and in so my hair color can turn hideous quickly this makes is a neutral blond it also smooths the cuticle i have found this brand of products to be really among the best i 've tried and as a product junkie i 've tried a lot buy this if you have brassiness in your hair and want extra body and control as you blow it out
5	i use it every day for past 4 months i 've had it i really like is and drying time of my hair is so much shorter !
5	i have used this for 15 years now and will always refill it it is light and sits on the skin rather than filling pores up
4	fuzz off is a hair removing cream that comes in a two ounce tube and can be spread out over the skin directly from the tube by turning the applicator around to on off the tip is soft and to the skin there is no messy hands if done right this cream works like nair but does n't have that obnoxious smell , although there is a slight smell more like moisturizing lotion or sunscreen this cream is meant to the skin in the areas that have already been shaved by leaving the cream on the targeted skin for five minutes , and no more than ten minutes this stuff is not meant for the face \( there is another bliss formula for that \) it truly is just meant for the bikini area the ingredients are \( taken from the bliss website since it 's not mentioned here \) water , urea , mineral oil , calcium , cetearyl alcohol , calcium hydroxide , potassium hydroxide , ceteareth 20 , bentonite , fragrance , butyrospermum parkii \( shea butter \) , glyceryl , titanium dioxide , disodium edta , silica , olea europaea \( olive \) oil unsaponifiables , \( coconut \) oil , theobroma cacao \( cocoa \) seed butter , , aloe barbadensis leaf juice , theobroma seed butter , , tocopheryl acetate the tube is easily thrown into a hygiene bag users must make sure the applicator is in the off position after use , because otherwise the cream shoots out at the next use my one concern is the high price
5	love this product ! i have a couple of bottles of this water that both my teen daughter and i have been using she has clear skin , not oily , only rarely breaks out does n't use any acne medicines i have oily skin and a lifelong battle with acne my skin is mostly clear , but that 's due to coating myself in acne medicines 24 7 my daughter uses this to clean her face and remove her eye makeup she 's thrilled with it i use it as a toner after washing my face , and before using my acne products it leaves my skin very smooth and refreshed highly recommended !
5	i had to replace my yellow bird 2000 hair dryer , which i 'd used for years the babyliss pro 2000 is just as good and not as heavy it does a great job drying my hair and the placement of the controls does n't interfere i only wish the cord was a little longer and heavier so it would n't curl up
1	this was listed as new and never used , so i did n't bother to read anymore information \( my fault and it will never happen again \) when received , one color was missing and others were loose i went back on amazon to read more not only did it say , new , never used , it went on to say used once go figure she refused me a refund !
5	i was looking a finish like this for a long time it 's just what i want ! ! ! little bit pink and transparent
2	didnt see and feel what i read in most of the reviews , i have curly hair , not very thick but freeze not for me
5	products like this make shaving a pleasure i have really sensitive skin , i decided to go old school and use a single edge safety razor , \( not a straight edge , yikes \) good hair brush , pre shave lotion , by edwin jagger combining these products with a good shave cream , like jack black , or similar product will make shaving like spa day for your face i do keep a triple edge for the heavy stubble areas , but once you go with a safety razor , you will be shaving for pennies a week , not dollars , like the fusion cost i am trying to in a lot of information here , but trust me , i have picked this method after years of beating up my face i treated myself to a good barber shave , and this are the products he used and i have been a believer ever since enjoy
5	i love it , it 's the real product , it smells funny but i can get over it i like to apply it right after home micro needling this product is not for micro needling and this is not advice for anyone , do it at your own risk i personally choose to do so and i have not had side effects
5	as promised and great transaction
5	this review is for the strivectin multi action restorative cream , 1 7 oz i have tried multiple products from strivectin with good results while not a facelift in a jar , it does reduce the of lines and hydrates skin where applied will make your skin feel much smoother and softer at the very least
4	great product and covers up thinning hair areas very well ! highly recommended but make sure to use some hair spray so that the fibers will stay in place !
5	it really does the job ! i am a woman with thinning hair i use the medium brown and it stays in until i shampoo my hair it does n't rub off on my pillows and the 87 oz can last a surprisingly long time i highly recommend this product , it 's so much better than the other things that i tried the joan rivers product was the worst it rubbed off on my pillows and the in my car
5	once you 've used this great polish remover , you 'll never use another ! i 've never used a remover that literally removes the polish with just one or two swipes , until now ! not only does it wipe away all the polish , but it smells great too ! you may look far and wide , but you 'll never find a polish remover that even comes close to this one amazing results , zoya !
5	love the product and super fast shipping
5	my stylist told me about toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be she purchased the 0 36oz 10 3g for me from the local beauty supply even with her discount it was almost 25 but i really liked how toppik camouflages my thin spots only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair only one person realized what the difference was , and only because she 'd also used toppik toppik is now a must have product for me so i started looking for a better bargain and found it here i get almost more than twice the product for only a few more i would definitely recommend toppik to anyone
5	love this kind of product and i'm a fan of jane iredale products this is similar to the dior self adjusting lipstick though priced about 10 bucks less and with better application so easy to use in both cheeks and lips
5	its been years since i paid attention to blush just have n't felt the need for it , and i 've gone much more natural in my look this blush , when used with a light hand , adds just the right kind of brightening to the cheekbones i was worried it would be too orange for me , but it works well and just brightens my face a bit \( using a brush \)
4	i finally like something from this brand ! this powder is super blendable , comes with a blending pad and a mirror the color is perfect for my beige skin tone and feels light and airy and looks good all day without caking up highly recommend
5	works amazing , just very black !
5	does what product said , it helps make hair fuller and silkier
5	i was a little unsure of this powder from the picture on amazon because the pattern reminded me a bit of dog or some weird skin disease , but i'm glad i ordered it because the picture does n't do it justice the pattern on the highlighter i received was much more pleasing to look at in person than the featured photo here it really does n't do it justice my winter skin can look a bit flat and dull so i 've been sweeping it on the apples of my cheeks , the bridge of my nose , and along the tops of my lips with a fluffy powder brush it gives the perfect amount of glow to my neutral toned light medium skin it 's just enough to make my skin look healthy and awake , but not so much that it looks glittery or unnatural i also like that it wears well throughout the day i apply a bit of setting spray afterwards \( urban decay \) and it still looks great hours later , even after a workout would recommend
5	what a delightful cleanser ! i am a dedicated micellar oil devotee by vichy but i'm in love with this product it 's everything i love in one product and does an excellent job of deep cleansing sensitive skin makeup literally melts away , and my skin feels soft and clean without feeling stripped after cleansing i like to use my super soft bamboo washcloth soaked in warm water to remove it after massaging it well into my skin a complexion brush really works too the scent of this cleanser is really fresh and clean , i love it ! my skin feels really calm and well , happy , after using this 3 in 1 cleanser i use retin a , and the vichy 3 in 1 is particularly ideal for that \( does n't over stimulate the skin prior to application \) this is an absolutely awesome sensitive skin cleanser and now my daily favorite , especially during the winter highly recommended !
5	best red ! ! ! just the perfect shade for every day wear
4	after two weeks use very moisturizing , on oily and a little sticky and has a slight fragrance that dissipates quickly do n't , a pea size amount can cover face and neck after waiting a few moments you can apply foundation without a primer and get decent coverage and glide at night i wait a few minutes after applying it before going to bed , so my pillowcase does n't get the no wrinkle benefits i 'd like my face to have \) all that being said , i can only attest to the moisturizing , skin softening and skin plumping that comes from applying this after washing wrinkles and creases between my eyebrows are softened and diminished , as are the age rings on my neck i do expect to see additional benefits with continued use
5	i have used this system for the past 5 years and have perfect results it took initially about 8 weeks before i truly noticed a difference since then every time i go to the dentist i am always complimented on the whiteness of my teeth , as well as by and others i do really like this product note your teeth can become sensitive to the after a long period of use just stop using for a couple weeks and your teeth will be normal again the toothpaste works great as with any new item , give it at least 90 days before you make your decision about the whitening effect
4	my first foray into trying a sheet mask was the patchology smartmud no mess mud detox mask i find no mess a big promise to , but this mask was far less messy than my usual mud \( or other wash off \) masks having a more petite face , the upper portion of the mask was particularly challenging to fit just right , i found the eyebrow area and the forehead zone the most oversized and caused me to spend extra time afterwards washing excess mud out of my brows and hairline the feel of the mask while on was fairly comfortable once the 10 minutes were up \( i set a timer \) i found the mask was n't too drying and kept it on maybe 3 more minutes or so before peeling both off my face nearly all of the mask was easy to peel right off and toss out , with the exception of the forehead region which was more stuck on i found my complexion looked brightened and facial skin felt more refreshed once the mask came off as for value , there 's only 4 sheet masks in the package , so there 's a high price point per mask however , the masks are a once a week type of splurge , so the value opinion will vary by person one star off for the fact that this mask has parabens , would love to see a version that is paraben free
3	it does n't curl my hair as well as my conair iron
5	gelatin like mask it really keeps your skin super moist the pinkish gelatin is quickly absorbed and forms a protective layer light sensation when applying do not wear this in the day time as it might cause sun spots use only at night when you wo n't be exposed to sunlight
5	i really like the serum , but just like other reviewers , my bottle was damaged upon arrival i have put the lid back on and i can still use it so i am only doing the review on the serum , not the condition of the bottle the serum is a gel consistency and goes on very smooth and absorbs well there is no oily residue and i put my daily moisturizer over the top of it i have noticed that my face holds moisture for longer when i am wearing this , but it is too soon to see if there will be a chance in in wrinkles etc overall i really like the serum and i have used other vichy products and have enjoyed them over the long run , i do n't see this product being any different
5	i love the feel of my skin when i use this serum it comes out with a stream of two different products which combines to work on your skin over time it includes some of the ingredients that scientists are touting for improving the appearance of skin my skin feel really good after applying it and it drinks in those ingredients to help it avoid wrinkles and other skin problems
1	this product is useless when i use the pad that comes with it , it takes off make up as i put the powder on forget waiting 2 minutes foundation leaves a permanent make up stain on the pad even after washing which tells me it really is soaking up the foundation rather than buffing it i tried this powder several different ways with 3 \( yes 3 different dermablend foundations i also reviewed \) another brand foundation , and on skin with no make up it works best and looks best on a make up less face next it works okay with another brand 's foundation not as much comes off and i'm here is a little bit of glow finally , it does nor work at all with dermablend foundations that 's right the pad takes off the most make up and has no glow with the very make up with which it should be designed to work well i tried using a brush made for compact powders , and it was a little better across the board in no scenario did my make up last any longer or prevent any more shine than using loose or compact powder from another brand it makes no sense to buy this compact
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	my husband has problems with dry skin on his hands , feet , and elbows he has been using this hand cream on all three spots for a couple of weeks and he really loves it it goes on well and absorbs nicely for him i tried it for myself and found that it was a little too much for me as it is marketed for men , i figured that it might be for hands that are used to rougher treatment than mine i will certainly be buying this again in the future for him
4	this nail treatment gave my nails a much needed boost the color when applied is a very natural and glossy sheer pink after about three days , i applied a second coat now , after 6 days since the first application , it looks like the original coat is breaking up underneath the second coat , so i will probably need to go ahead an remove both current coats while , i do n't think this will magically transform brittle nails , i do think that it was definitely not my nails look healthier and i really like the light sheen this nail treatment gives them ! i think it could definitely be a plus if you 're needing to help strength in your nails after applying artificial nails or harsher gel polishes
5	my salon uses essie products and they work well on my thin , dry nails i bought several colors
3	the first thing you 'll notice when you apply is that it does n't feel like the brush is grabbing your lashes there is n't a lot of load or deposit , which is me as to why they named it mega volume it 's naturally separating and defining , but the volume only comes when you add additional swipes of the ball tip this means more work for you , building up layers of thickness if you want to swipe and go out the front door with a quick flick of the brush , you 're going to get a more natural look if you 're expecting volume , add a little more time to your makeup routine
4	first the positives the color lingers between light and medium and could easily blend with most caucasian or asian skin tones unfortunately it would not work for very light or darker skin tones it has a rich , smooth consistency and one pump was enough to blend all over my entire face for a semi sheer finish that 's all great but the earthy scent was too much for me it smells a lot like juice beauty products can this was like it and more i tried to leave it on hoping the scent would dissipate , but it did n't ultimately , i had to go wash it off my face because i could n't stop sneezing now , not everyone will necessarily have this problem if you are n't sensitive to strong scents , then you might like this cream i really wanted to love this product , but unfortunately the scent was so strong that i gave it away
5	a single pump is all i need to work up a respectable good smelling lather my face is patchy dry here , oily over there combination skin this formula works gently but effectively and does n't dry me out horribly in those areas where my skin is less oily it 's an effective cleanser that works gently without harsh chemicals or over powering fragrances i find that it smells refreshing it does a very good job of removing makeup even in sensitive areas , such as eye make up this is a good sized bottle since you do n't need to use very much to thoroughly cleanse your face , it should last a respectable amount of time \( in a single user scenario \)
5	this lotion has the perfect scent of fresh cut roses ! it is lovely ! imagine surrounding yourself with that heady scent ! this lotion goes on smoothly and is easily and quickly absorbed it the skin it is non greasy and light this is a wonderful body lotion !
5	i knew i liked this perfume from the moment i spritzed some on my wrists it 's an awesome fragrance not too strong , not too light it lasts for hours , which is good enough for me it 's been a long while since i have going from the milder colognes to genuine longer lasting perfume , but after reading the reviews i decided to get this calvin klein euphoria and i'm glad i did it 's just the right blend of floral and woodsy to suit my tastes and the men in my life agree with the cost of living so high now , everyone appreciates a good buy and since this name brand perfume is 20 cheaper than my favorite department store , i am beyond pleased in addition to the fragrance being so pleasant , i think the bottle is well designed pretty , elegant and rosy pink it looks lovely on my dresser next to a family photo in a mother of pearl frame i recommend this highly to anyone who likes their fragrance more light , airy and lasting to describe it in one word well , that would be \) reviewed by betty dravis , february 23 , 2015 author of the search for
5	tried quite a lot of brands , the best so far for my very sensitive skin avene products are great
4	love this color ! i layer it over strawberry smoothie and it creates such a pretty , natural color it 's great for me as a busy mom , because the outgrowth does n't look as bad as maybe a gray color would i can get away with putting off doing my nails a little longer when i do the strawberry smoothie with two coats of this over ! the picture shows of outgrowth ! came brand new and as described !
5	lovely color ! !
5	the tizo am cream goes on very smoothly and leaves my skin feeling almost velvety soft it smooths out my face and makes my skin look more even toned i am 33 and do n't have a ton of wrinkles yet , however , after applying this cream i do feel like my skin looks a little smoother i'm not sure if it will have lasting affect on preventing wrinkles or reversing the fine lines that i do have but i am happy with what i am able to see and feel so far the price is a little steep in my opinion but it is a good product
4	im in my mid 50s and this is the decade where my neck is starting to get saggy and crepey this strivectin tightening neck serum roller is to the neck which is cool as i focus so much on the skin on my face but have n't really done anything special for my neck aside from containing chemicals like bht , this is a serum i enjoy and ill finish the entire tube \( and buy it if i think the benefits outweigh the chemicals \) i love the delivery of the serum in the tube through a metal roller top it keeps the product fresh and also feels refreshing rolling it over my clean skin i work it in with my fingertips and apply my favorite firming face cream to my neck afterwards i have sensitive skin and have n't experienced any irritation , and i find the fragrance so mild i wish strivectin would leave it out as its just one more unnecessary chemical i cant claim an overnight miracle , but i do get an instant benefit as the skin on my neck definitely feels softer and firmer it also looks a little more taut and less crepey im looking forward to finishing this tube \( which looks like it could take a few months \) to see what long range benefits it provides \( if any \) and will update if i see a more dramatic result so far i really like this strivectin serum , though im taking off one star for chemicals like bht and fragrance 4 stars
5	this is the perfect medium brown color for fall very polished look , and a great change from the normal bright colors
5	i absolutely love this stuff ! ! it covers your scalp and seems to make your hair seem fuller i no longer worry that people will see my balding head it even helps kind of cover my gray hair at the roots i really do love toppik ! it works great !
4	this is not a moisturizer and i would n't call it a serum it does n't offer any protection from the sun what it does is help smooth out those little lines it 's actually a rather effective primer , and that 's how i use it after i wash my face , the first thing i reach for is a facial serum i use three different kinds , depending on the day and which bathroom i'm in at the time i'm a believer is serums and they are always the first thing i feed my skin after washing after that , i use a good quality moisturizer with a decent spf after my skin has absorbed that , i use a tiny bit of this cream a little goes a long way to me it feels like it 's creating a thin layer all across my face , absorbing just enough to everything fill in the gaps , so to speak afterwards , makeup goes on with similar results as when i use a primer
5	very pleasant aroma , not too overwhelming fades within at least four hours , but that 's okay , you do n't want to smell like an person anyway
5	i have sensitive eyes and a lot of mascara 's get in my eye , make them tear up and then smudge ! yuck this mascara really surprised me and i'm glad i tried it what do i like about this product 1 \) this mascara applies easily it can also be layered to thicken the lashes but i just prefer a little darkening to give my eyes a little extra pop 2 \) it really is water proof and did not smudge ! \( okay , i got a little eyed and none of it came off ! \) 3 \) it does n't feel heavy or pasty like most other mascaras \( this may not be the case if you layer a lot i do not \) 4 \) with make up remover it came off relatively easy 5 \) it did not irritate my eyes overall impression while i am not a huge mascara user this one fit all the issues that i typically have problems with it did take a little bit of experimenting to get the coverage i liked but once that was done i found it an easy and great addition to my makeup regime when i want to add extra splash i think the big plus was that it did not irritate my eyes i get a lot of eye allergies and have very dry eye since it was water proof and did not get in my eyes , this is this first one i could tolerate for hours the only real issue might be the price tag for some people hesitant to give it a try
4	this shampoo is reminiscent of a shampoo \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href peppermint shampoo dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 \( \) peppermint shampoo a \) , only not as strong \( personally , i prefer the stronger mint smell of the version , but to each his own \) nevertheless , the baxter shampoo works well it does n't lather up , but gives my scalp a nice tingle some reviewers , i noticed , this product for containing parabens , which have been linked to cancer \( like just about everything else on the planet \) if parabens are a concern of yours , there are alternatives you can seek out , like burt 's bees products \( supposedly \) caveat
5	i 've only been using this for a few days and i can already see the difference the dark spots have been reduced , slightly , but reduced i'm hopeful that if i use this for a few weeks months , they will be barely visible
5	i love a good barbershop shave but usually splurge on one for special occasions or when the wife surprises me this baxter of california kit is like a barbershop shave diy shave tonic the shave tonic is the prep work to a great shave , though it can be used post shave too i applied a generous amount of shave tonic to a hot face towel \( hot water about 20 seconds in the \) the shave tonic smells great \( lots of eucalyptus \) and feels great too thanks to the cooling sensation of menthol post shave you can apply this product to a cool towel and apply it to your face to reduce redness and irritation after shave this is a very good aftershave it smells terrific \( nothing floral \) and leaves skin feeling cool , refreshed and clean there 's no greasy feel or excessive burning paired with your standard shaving routine this is a great way to get an excellent shave while probably not practical for everyday use the shave tonic is a great way to vary up your shave and leave your skin feeling great recommended !
4	i have very sensitive skin , so i am cautious when i use new things on my skin i did a test using the back of my hand , and so far so good the serum felt good on my skin i did n't have any stinging sensations as another reviewer mentioned i then tried the serum on my forehead , just to make sure it was ok on my face again , so far so good i will have to come back in a few weeks to give a to this review i do think this product is rather expensive , so the results would have to be phenomenal to get me to buy it
2	color is nice but liked better that has a beautiful gloss finish
4	i have never used a product like this before and found that it is really effective as a cleanser my usual first product , a clinique clarifying lotion , that i use at night when i have been out or sweaty , does not usually take that much dirt off my face this left my face feeling a little oily rather than dry the scent was a little heavy
5	i have been using this product for about a year can get old after about 6 months it becomes difficult to apply and then does n't hold up as strong as it use to 6 months is a great time frame for a product to last a regular coat is all you need not too thin or thick
4	way more transparent than i thought pretty color with fine glitter it 's nice as a tint of color need 3 4 coats for opaqueness
3	just another red
3	i love the metallic shellac colors but i was a bit disappointed with vexed violet i was looking for a metallic violet and this color looks more gray than violet
4	this is a nice concealer the texture is creamy and light , but it still covers problem areas i'm pleased that it comes in a tube , because it keeps contaminants to an absolute minimum a great feature for a product that will be worn next to your eyes i received this concealer through the vine program although i was supposed to be sent color fair neutral cool , i received the neutralizer instead i'm pale , and i typically wear the second lightest color sold in any makeup line , so the neutralizer was a bit dark for my skin tone even so , it worked better than i thought it would when i saw the color in the tube i attribute this to how well it blends i would buy a lighter color next time , but that 's the only change i 'd make
4	very good product and really does give the impression that you have more than you really do ! i highly recommend if you are looking for a quick and easy way to cover up thinning hair ! !
3	this masque worked just fine with taking tangles out of my hair but i cannot say it added any shine as i said , it worked fine like any other masque but you can get the same results without paying this much
5	i love this product it works sooooo well it really sets your makeup and looks great leaves a nice finish on your face works very well ! a little goes a long way , so this will last a very long time great product
5	this color is gorgeous ! so sparkly and so blue i will definitely order this one again very summery ! lasts well , too
3	first off a review of the product itself i have n't come across such a non greasy spf formula in a face lotion before it truly does feel dry to the touch quickly after application i like a strong spf and they often feel tacky on your face this one really does go on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling nicely moisturized sounds pretty great so why only three stars \? this company does testing on animals which makes it a product i would never purchase again despite how great it is but that 's a personal preference for me if you 're looking for a non greasy sunscreen for your face this is a good product to go with but beware mind of what you are purchasing and know that testing is conducted on animals by this company
5	i thought this would be a typical lip gloss , but was delighted that it has a very beautiful matte finish the brush application makes it very accurate for a nice smooth line it made my lips look fuller , too it has a very light , quickly fading vanilla sugary scent which is very pleasing it 's long lasting and this color shade 04 is a beautiful natural pink that is very flattering to my light complexion i had not heard of this brand before trying this lip lacquer \( i generally use lancome \) but i like this so much , i want to try their other cosmetics
4	my wife tried this i really like this toner , however im not sure long term what it is supposed to do for the skin after ive used my obagi cleanser , i put a bit of toner on a cotton ball and apply it to my face it appears to do just what it says its gentle and helps balance the skin after cleansing \( i e , adds a bit of moisture after the cleanser has removed all oils from the face \) im just not sure what it does , considering after the toner is used , i use the moisturizer \( or serum , or peptide complex \) i could n't tell a huge difference on days when i skipped the toner though i could tell a difference when i skipped the moisturizer , serum , peptide complex , etc anyway , if you like to use a toner , this is a good one im just not sold considering the price tag
4	although im not an avid perfume user , my favorite is viva la juicy la as the name implies , la has sweet floral notes while oribe has floral grassy notes which evokes sophistication and maturity even with the grown up feel of oribe , im surprised by their modest looking packaging while la has a glass crystal like top , oribe has an embossed black plastic top giving me that drug store like feel which is unfortunate
4	it works really well to hair rather than having to wash every day years ago i bought this and it was more of an aerosol with the current one its like an air pump and it causes the product to come out unevenly and makes it difficult to control where and how you want it thats why the four stars
5	this color is so lovely ! the product only requires one coat and it lasts for 7 days
5	i had no experience with the em michelle phan brand before trying this mascara so i had no idea what to expect , but i found myself pleasantly surprised this mascara formula with really does make your lashes look longer i followed my typical mascara routine curling my lashes first with a lash curler and then followed up with two even coats of this mascara and they look noticeably longer i also had no problems with my lashes sticking together , they look nice and distinct this does n't have as dramatic of effects as applying false eyelashes , but for mascara it 's about the most effective i 've tried for lengthening lashes \( and that is saying a lot because i am quite with my mascaras and have tried quite a range of specialty , department store , and drug store brands \) i also found this shade of black to be very flattering i have blonde hair with gray eyes and it definitely made my eyes pop , but did n't look too severe or dramatic for everyday they also wear very well i do n't have any problems with smudges and or flaking mascara in fact , the one night i wore this mascara to bed without taking it off my lashes looked surprisingly good the next morning i also found removal of this mascara to be no more difficult than with the other brands i 've used a few swipes of nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href neutrogena cleansing oil free eye makeup remover 5 5 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 neutrogena cleansing oil free eye makeup remover , 5 5 ounce a nbsp on a cotton ball has been all i 've needed to remove the mascara and my subsequent applications have looked as good as the first time i tried this the one thing that remains to me to be seen is how long this mascara stays fresh i typically love a mascara when it is new , but some seem to go clumpy quite quickly meaning i often find that mascara goes bad before i have a chance to use it all which is disappointing here 's to hoping this formula stays fresh for a good amount of time overall i'm quite impressed with this mascara , especially for the price point and it has definitely made me curious to try other products in the em michelle phan line
4	my likes to use this nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href aztec healing clay dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 aztec healing clay a , which i 've tried once and it was alright something more targeted for men would be nice , thus my choice of baxter since i have oily , sensitive skin , i have just one demand of a healthy beauty product please do n't mess up my skin and cause a reaction of some kind so far , baxter has n't let me down the directions say to apply a thin layer , but go ahead and be liberal with it if you do n't mind running out of the product quicker i feel like it 's a better experience when the stuff is really caked on look at me , i 've got mud on my face ! let it sit for like ten minutes and then rinse it off with warm water it leaves my skin soft and \( hopefully \) purified how my skin feels in winter will be the true test since this summer has been very humid
4	if i had n't had a set of these in past , i would scream in shock at the cost but years ago , i got a gift of a version of this set \( but it also included cuticle scissors \) i became so attached to the set , in its little leather pouch , that i hated to take it on trips because i feared losing it and then of course , the of a set sold by that for a while could no longer be taken a plane \( now , unless you run into an authority figure with different information , you can take nail clippers \) the zwilling steel is sharp and the nail clippers are so sharp , it 's nothing like the ones you clamp on a nail and press for dear life these are like razors and they leave a sharp bit of if you do n't your nail into the jaws , or if you have big nails and are making your way across with the clipper but then there 's the file , which is , from the looks of it , with industrial diamond dust there is a coarse side and a fine side and it works well sharp tip for removing grime the tweezers are great they grip for years and only need a touch of sharpening on a stone now and then unlike some tweezers that give up and never grab again , these do n't give up four out of five stars i love it and loved my previous set but the price is a tad hard to , especially with no cuticle scissors anymore but if you want one set that lasts for ever and stays very sharp , this is it it 's very luxurious , i you that
5	dermablend quick fix concealer stick is concealer packaged the old fashioned way stick ! you can wear it on bare skin , under or even over foundation just pat on your skin to cover blemishes or scars , and then set with powder this works great for covering up dark circles under your eyes , too this product is not dry or flaky and does n't get stuck in my wrinkles it offers coverage and blends well it easily fits into my simple beauty routine and i love it !
5	this agave healing oil treatment works ! ! ! that is a huge statement because i feel as if i have tried almost every shine and anti frizz product out there under 100 bottle or tube and have had lackluster to no results at all i first tried this when we had no working in our house , in the middle of winter with the heat day and hair was floating through the air with static and dryness agave completely took care of that problem while giving me soft , manageable it even has some shine ! i did use a large quarter size squeeze of it out of desperation , but it did n't make my hair oily or heavy i am giving this product a glowing recommendation !
4	its ok
5	love the shine and the time to dry i would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others
4	i have waist length very fine hair , straight with no wave or curl my hair takes no curl , regardless of how much energy i put into it i was skeptical of this but am willing to try almost anything for a bit of texture i do not use a hair dryer so i applied this to damp hair and let air dry while i did not get a head full of waves , i did get some sweet texture and volume plus this lotion smells fantastic in my hair i 've played around with it and like the results i 've had zero luck with similar products so i am quite pleased with the outcome with this
2	i purchased this item directly from the manufacturer , so i know it was genuine i was super excited to try this product bc it looked so exciting and different i also loved the potential anti aging effects with this item but the big but is whether or not it cleans better than my clarisonic mia it does n't i using the mia one night and the luna the next night , several nights in a row whenever i used my luna , my face still had grime on it it was not as clean as the nights i used my mia also , i find it an oddly shaped and designed device for the face it 's hard to get it to fit everywhere it 's basically like taking a flat ish rock and trying to clean your face with the tip of that rock not always a good fit for now , i'm sticking with my mia and will be returning the luna until the design is much improved they should 've waited to bring this product to market , in my opinion it 's just not up to par as the excellent face cleaner that it 's meant to be and marketed as
5	excellent
5	bioderma has the best micellar water out there period i honestly did n't think there was going to be much difference between garnier , simple , bioderma but i was wrong bioderma is superior to all micellar waters it takes less effort to get your skin completely clean , it removes eye makeup easily , and does not suck the life out of your face highly recommend this product
5	not good on waterline but on lid , dark , soft black the best thing is this pencil is not difficult to remove with makeup remover good on my sensitive eyelids and does n't make my eyes irritated
5	this is great at getting off all of my makeup , even my stubborn mascara it 's gentle on the skin and does n't burn or sting your eyes
5	like many buyers of this brand i discovered this soap while staying at the four seasons hotels in , ca these bars smell so good and they last for nearly two months thats just a 2oz bath size , i can only imagine what the will stay useful \? i have used these soaps for showers due to my water and the risk of slipping never drying nor any like itching , sticky film or lots of soap luxury all wrapped up in one bar
1	this japonesque kumadori buffing brush is a great brush , until you wash it the brush is a perfect size the handle is and comfortable the bristles are firm , yet very soft the brush worked well with foundations , bronzers and blushes the design has a end for easy drying after washing it the real test of a good quality brush is washing it after using it for a week with powders , i rinsed it , gently washed it with a drop of mild shampoo , rinsed , towel blotted it , it and hung it to dry the next morning , i applied some powder and immediately upon using it , the bristles were falling out all over the place i 've had cheap brushes where the brush falls apart after a few washings , but this is ridiculous a brush that cannot survive one gentle wash is a total waste of money i am surprised that japonesque would allow a brush this nice to be made this cheap and pass any form of quality control if i could , i would rate this 0 stars , as it 's a total waste of money
5	this is by far my favorite color purchase i like to pair this at times for extra sparkle with sparkle silver for extra shine
5	i received a sample of this in a l'occitane sample bag there was several products in there \( all of which i loved \) , but this one took the cake i 've completely face washes , like the cetaphil face cleanser which i 've been using for years , and replaced it entirely with this my skin loves this since replacing my makeup wipes face cleansers with this product , my skin has cleared up , i 've had no breakouts , my skin tone is even and bright , no redness , no excessive , no dry patches , and my skin looks the best it 's every looked i usually wear a full face of make up \( foundation , concealer , mascara , etc \) and this removes all of my makeup with ease l'occitane is a great line , but this face oil takes the cake it is a little pricey for an everyday face wash , but i feel you can never be too careful when it comes to your skin , especially your face this product is worth every penny one pump is all you need so this 6 ounce bottle will last you a very long time smells heavenly highly , highly recommend
4	delightful , warm and juicy , and feminine are the that come to mind when describing this perfume eau sensuelle comes in a gorgeous bottle that remind you of enticing layers of and spring turning to summer days this fragrance was launched in after rochas was acquired by p g in the top notes are fruity blood orange , mango and bergamot middle notes jasmine , orris root , orange blossom base notes dried fruits , musk and pink pepper the blood orange and mango notes lends it a bitter and almost too fruity fragrance in the opening notes and then you start to smell the orange blossom it almost smells like juicy fruit gum , almost but then the flowery middle notes take over the jasmine is fainter but the dry down is slightly musky and slightly spicy the dry down works for me the most and therefore makes it a more complex fragrance than the cheap drug store variety it lasts 3 4 hours on me and the sillage is moderate making it suitable for work i will add it to my spring summer collection of fruity flowery fragrances like d light blue , burberry brit , dkny be delicious and my cheap go to by this is another lighter , fruitier and fresher sort of fragrance to add to this collection , but since it 's new and light it will probably be gone by end of summer this year
5	i 've struggled with acne for years , as a teen , as well as an adult in my experience , salicylic acid treatments work better on oily skin or teen acne , while adult acne \( or more troublesome acne \) is better treated by benzoyl peroxide because of my long history with these products , i did n't expect to be too impressed by this product because it is a salicylic acid treatment i get acne on the left side of my face in a very localized area sometimes the acne will disappear for months , but it always comes back , and it usually lingers for awhile when i started getting acne again after a long period of not having any , i decided to try this i used it as a spot treatment on the few pimples that had popped up overnight to my surprise , i only needed to apply it once , and the acne has n't returned i do n't know if i would call it a miracle perhaps i got lucky but i am seriously impressed maybe it is the inclusion of hyaluronic acid that made the difference \? i have now been acne free for about a week when my acne returns \( because it always does \) i will try this again , and if i do n't have the same results , i will update this review if other acne sufferers are looking for an alternative or natural cure , i would like to mention that neem and zinc \( in combination \) have worked well for me in the cast
5	i have used other face brushes in the past , including a top of the line clairsonic , and this is so much better for one thing , it really exfoliates without causing irritation it 's a breeze to charge , and i love that instead of having to replace a brush head , all i need to do it wash the silicone bristles it 's the bristles that really make all the difference also , this may be marketed as a men 's product , but it truly is unisex i love this
5	man , i love avene i use tons of their products expensive , but worth it
5	i had been using a different brand , but wanted a change i love this face wash it does n't over dry my face , i do have oily skin i 've been using it for almost 2 weeks and no break outs , i do n't break out much , but i do have sensitive skin and have dermatitis on my skin , and this wash does not flare it up it 's clear and it does foam up
5	this is a very pleasant smelling beard oil i love the smell of lime \( i'm a big fan \) so this seems made for me it comes in a eyedropper bottle which is great because it prevents waste a little of it goes a long way in addition to shaving , i use this oil as a moisturizer i have dry patches at the bottom of my feet and this makes my skin feel smooth and smell great i understand you can also use it in an aromatherapy diffuser but i have n't tried that yet overall , i love this scent and look forward to purchasing more
4	i have fair skin , so i am always worried about colors being too dark , but this was a pretty good match i like the built in spf protection i felt like the product stayed on my skin nicely , and i did not need to reapply i also did not feel like i was wearing a ton of make up , which is important to me all in all a great product
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	this is the cream i use every night and every morning works well for intolerant skin !
2	this product left and oily appearance on my skin
5	all ok
4	this product does provide a lot of coverage , but it 's not a dream product you will need more than a thin layer to cover , heavier coverage will need to be built up and it 's very visible on the skin if you build it up to full coverage , which pretty much defeats the purpose of correcting skin unless perhaps it 's for a stage situation where you will only be viewed at a distance i also found this formula on the dry pasty side , and while it may sometimes be the only product that works , it is not a pleasure to work with and you absolutely will feel having product on , this is n't weightless it 's not irritating , but it also is n't second skin comfortable i 've worked with this item in several colors and they all are darker than these images appear while i do appreciate that they have a wide shade range , i wish better photos and descriptions were provided if purchasing this , be sure you also get a setting powder , as this does need to be set i would also suggest a brush for application
5	i have a drawer full of eyeshadow crayons , everything from chanel down to the cheap brand of hard candy that you can buy at walmart this crayon by jouer is among the best i have tried the color is a that looks well on anyone and can be applied lightly for day to more heavily at night for a truly smokey look it is long lasting and does n't crease i really loved the way this looks and feels as well as the fact that is extremely long lasting even when it is warm outside
4	i really do love these products great makeup this is easy to apply and covers all skin imperfections \( i e i have some skin damage from the sun with age spots \) i did deduct one star simply because i thought this was a little lighter than i was expecting i ended up smoothing it out and covering it with my standard foundation so the lightness blended easily away i do recommend overall because of the way my skin looks \( virtually flawless \) after using these products
5	perfect , non irritating , smoothing it 's exactly what i was looking for to smooth the texture of the skin around my eyes not so much for wrinkles , but for overall texture , which seemed a bit drier and rougher than it used to be i'm alternating it with a peptide product and it 's doing what i hoped it would and not causing any problems for my sensitive skin and for 20 , that 's a very good deal i 'll probably get the mb moisturizer to go with it
4	like most metallic shimmer colors , this chips easier than a cream \( but i am hard on polish any time \) the color is very unusual , it is almost a cool gold , not quite tan , undertone with a warm \( not cool \) silver metallic flash in the light it goes on streaky , so needs two or three coats , although the streaks do n't show when it 's flashing silver , just when the base color shows it is not gray the base color is more prominent with just one coat
3	minty , creamy , woody , almost some cinnamon supposed to have strong black pepper notes but i did n't notice that , although my wife did maybe my nose is defective however , there 's also a talcum powder note that i'm not crazy about sends the wrong vibe maybe medium sillage after a few minutes i do n't think it 's noticeable past one or two feet away
5	i love this product ! it is gentle and moisturizing it is a great daily face wash it smells good and it lasts a long time a little goes a long way you really get your worth i use sucker punch 2 3 times a week to get the exfoliation i need too
4	contents should be filled closer to the top of the bottle otherwise , product was fine delivery was also good
4	this is a wonderful body lotion that has surpassed my usual firming lotion , it feels much more silky and sinks in better quicker i love the feminine scent and enjoy putting it on it is more expensive than my old lotion , but the performance justifies the higher price the product packaging leaves a lot to be desired , no outer box for protection so it showed up broken , but it still barely works so fingers crossed the pump continues to work the whole time
2	the texture of the cream mousse made it hard for the product to spread evenly on my skin which is combination it was almost too thick and dry , but it might work better on oilier complexions the coverage overall was n't great , and did n't really blur the look of my pores either while it was n't a great bb cream for me , i did find that it works surprisingly well as a primer
5	i never got this product from the shipper \( not amazon \) amazon did a great job my order and providing me with a refund i cannot complain about amazon 's part of the process but , i do want to go on record as a long time user of nail envy i stand by this product for example , i was given a gel manicure just one ! my nails were severely damaged after removal of that manicure everything i touched caused my nails to break and split because i know what nail envy can do , i applied a coat to my nails every other day my nails are long , beautiful , strong , and healthy again you just may want to purchase nail envy from a local beauty supply store unless you can find a better via amazon it 's worth every penny
5	gorgeous color , goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone very happy
4	the winter is always harsh on my skin , and i decided to try this as part of my collection of products to treat my dry skin definitely a oily feel , but did not leave an oily residual on the bath tube , and hence no slippery effect i did n't worry about slippery it is not a soap , but after you have showered , and rinse definitely , helped to , lock in some of the moisture , no oily on the skin , absorbs right into the skin one less star , as the rinse does wash off the impact , i rather wished it could be applied after shower with no rinse
5	first , i meant to order the 1 curling iron so i'm going to give you the circumference of the 3 4 one which is 2 7 8 when i hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3 4 my hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor i 'd be burning myself quite often if i was using the 1 size i have a 1 hot tool curing iron , just like this one , that i 've been using for over 6 years my husband replaced the plug once because i had to keep the cord plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on recently i began having problems with the cord again , but this time it 's where the cord attaches to the handle that is why i was ordering another curling iron this new design is supposed to prevent that problem only time will tell i will update my review if necessary these irons come with two extra springs i did n't have to use the extra springs with my old one , but i'm very happy the extras are included \( we 've had to replace the springs in other curling irons i 've owned through the years it was never easy to find a replacement spring \) the temperature settings numbers eventually wore off of my old one i'm expecting this one to do the same because they 're applied in the same manner i have a favorite setting i marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so i 'd know which setting to use although these curling irons get very , very hot i do not will not use the higher settings for goodness , my hair is n't made from fyi my hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot thankfully , it was in a hidden spot , i do n't have long layers , and i was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back anyway , let that be a warning to you it can happen i 've used curling irons for years years years that was a first for me my hairdresser i use the 7 temperature it 's the first setting on the category my baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl if this curling iron lives up to its predecessor , i can expect many more useful years out of it and , soon , i will be placing an order for the 1 size great curling iron !
5	love it !
5	i have ordered my second jar of the revision firming night treatment , which means i still love the results i'm getting i apply this product at night as my moisturizer and by morning , my skin still has a dewy appearance \( not greasy , but moisturized , \( thus the 'glow' description in title \) due to thyroid issues , my skin tends to be dry i have tried some of the more expensive moisturizers that , by morning , leave my skin looking and feeling pretty dry i like the revision night treatment so much that i would use it even in the day time however , i think it might be a little too moisturizing to use under foundation the jar contains 1 oz , where other more expensive moisturizers usually contain 1 7 oz , but i believe the is still more economical as it seems to last about the same length of time very little product is needed for each application regarding what it actually does for my skin , i ca n't be sure that it is actually getting rid of wrinkles it might be softening the appearance just because of how it moisturizes all in all , i believe it is a great product for the money and i certainly recommend it
5	terrific product for combination skin \( also soothes redness \) we use it twice daily after cleansing it is an important part of our skin care
5	this color is surprisingly unique the closest thing i have to it is opi 's let me entertain you , but this polish is quite a bit more purple it 's a nice brighter shade that still reads on point for fall great application , passable with one coat
5	mr burberry is the first cologne i 've found that me away from the chanel platinum i 've been wearing for years \( er , decades \) that 's not too surprising , as i did a little online research and found quite a few similarities in the topnotes between them both have a sandalwood base , and a citrus top note between the two , my wife much prefers mr burberry a of the four kids breaks along gender lines , with the boys liking platinum and the girls preferring mr burberry , probably because it 's a little lighter and more floral on top the black and white photos do n't do justice to the color of this cologne a lovely , pale aqua blue the bottle looks really great on the shelf mr burberry top notes grapefruit , , cardamom heart notes birch leaf , nutmeg , cedarwood base notes sandalwood , vetiver , guaiac wood
5	the color is a beautiful dark pink berry color , not a dark color but for pinks , considered dark the formula is great and super easy to work with and very shiny i can decide if this polish is a creme or jelly so ill go with crelly
4	usually , my nail polish chips in 1 day this one is long lasting , but i find that i need to shake it often \( almost between each nail \) or it gets clumpy , and then it dries with a dull finish nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat ca n't fix i'm really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4
3	this is a very thick mascara with a long lash brush , it really makes your lashes stand out the mascara goes on thick , and stays on all day a little thick for my liking , but works for me i 've never tried this brand , so i did n't expect such a thick product it is lash loading ! !
5	c makes excellent , but expensive products
5	one of my favorite colors i definitely recommend this color
5	i love this color essie is always a hit or miss for me this is definitely a hit ! plus i love the name !
5	bought this after the nurse at my dermatologist 's office \( when asked about the product \) said it was the one product a previous dermatologist she worked for stated worked well it use it twice a day as directions state it is expensive but you do n't have to use a lot at once , so it lasts a fairly good time i ordered it on line vs the dermatologist 's office because it was cheaper i would recommend
5	picked this out at the nail salon today wanted a pink that was pale but not too pail to wash out my hands love it ! perfect pail pink color with a tiny bit of sparkle
4	very refined scent , not flowery at all and i like that this is n't overwhelming it 's a body spray , so it should n't be a nice after shower , after gym light scent easy to use and subtle
5	for the first time in my life \( and it 's a long one \) , i have an eyebrow pencil that works and looks the way it 's supposed to it goes on smoothly and easily and even helps you shape your brows i am not blond , so i 've never tried eyeshadow labeled as such my hair is light to medium golden brown with reddish highlights and my skin is very light in the ivory range whenever i 've used brown eyebrow pencils in the past , i 've had to be very careful to just touch up the paler areas with the lightest touch possible i prefer a natural look and it 's always been ridiculously hard to achieve with my eyebrows in the past just too much trouble , so i 'd go out with natural brows that have faded , over the years , to a pale blond on the outer edges , after the this blond pencil is really a very light brown and it fills in my brows to absolute perfection i love it
5	new favorite color ! a gorgeous charcoal color i get comments on it every time i wear it !
5	l'occitane immortelle divine face cream l'occitane has a well deserved reputation for wonderful skin care products and this is a superior face lotion visually , the presentation and packaging are very pleasing to the eye this would make a really nice present ! this face cream has a very rich , creamy texture and a fresh light scent the scent is neither cloying nor overpowering and does not interfere with your cologne or perfume its price point may be a little higher than many usual face creams , but i find i use a lot less , adhering to those 5 small point application techniques one dot respectively on the forehead , nose , right and left cheeks , and chin i have used a light dot around the sensitive eye area with no adverse using it this way , one jar lasts about 3 5 months l'occitane immortelle divine face cream goes on easily and spreads well the scent is reminiscent of a light floral citrus pear combination the texture of the cream is rich and nourishing and is readily absorbed , without any excessive greasiness the pillowcase never has any greasy residue on it as can happen with other night creams i find that this face cream is well tolerated as no redness , blotchiness , nor rashes have ever developed after months of use additionally , this face cream does not appear to be comedogenic \( pimple causing \) at all that often happens when a face cream is too greasy , not well absorbed and just on top of your skin , in the bacteria \( acnes \) that can cause pimple development trap in moisture in your skin by lightly cleansing the face with clear water prior to application of the cream this habit can be especially helpful after a shower l'occitane immortelle divine face cream can be used well with most skin care with all new skin care products , patch testing is usually recommended before application , apply a small amount to an area you can monitor \( such as the under belly of the forearm \) if no itching or redness develops , it is not likely that an allergy has occurred you might then want to try more liberal use and greater distribution but , when in doubt , always stop use and consult a physician this super face cream works very nicely as a night cream it 's just a really fine face cream highly recommended ! update after many weeks of use , the face seems brighter and more alert any dark circles under the eyes have visibly diminished and there is no puffiness around the eyes others have favorably commented \( are you doing something different \? getting more sleep or exercise \? \) so it 's not just my impression the facial skin appears visibly improved with regular use of this face cream no discoloration or other blemish have ever occurred while using this cream l'occitane immortelle divine face cream has been used nightly for a few months and it is well tolerated its best use seems to be as an all around moisturizing night cream \( no sun block \) that helps to even your tone and coloration there has been no of age related skin no change in my original opinion after months of use i still like it a lot
4	a friend and i saw this polish on pinterest but could n't find it anywhere we were so happy to see it on amazon it is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year , as well as any occasion you can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event !
5	excellent product , good price , work as needed
5	i was n't sure if i 'd like it but after completing my nails i sprayed this on and sat for about 15 minutes my nails were good to go i used a nail ridge filler and two coats of polish and i think how many coats you put on makes the difference again , you ca n't go wrong with opi
5	i love this product makes my derma pen glide i can use it with micro needling or by itself it does a great job
5	i have to say , the scent is fantastic the whole bathroom smells great , and i love it first time i used it , i knew i 'd love coming back to it again and again definitely do n't have to worry about it melting like some other soaps dove is a bad i'm almost too sad to use it this soap is just so beautiful
5	i use the dermablend quick fix concealer stick to cover the dark areas under my tired eyes and the occasional zit it 's easy to use just dab the stick directly on the spot you want to conceal i blend it in with my fingertip it goes on so smooth and blends easily it provides good coverage without looking thick or you can layer it for more coverage even in the sweaty hot days this summer , i do n't have to touch it up during the day
5	i have dark circles from year round allergies i have tried many different types of concealer this product goes on easily and covers well it cakes around wrinkles a little , but it still is better than most products it has n't made me break out yet either overall , i am happy with the product i have included a picture of me wearing the concealer only , no eye makeup
4	i had my nephew use this for three weeks and what follows are what he told me he was never one to really worry about his skin in the past , but now that he is 34 he is seeing the benefit to trying to begin \( and maintain \) a new skin regimen he told me that he really likes the way his skin feels , and looks , and that he finds he is getting a much closer shave then he did before using this he did say he did n't feel it was truly worth the price and that he could probably do better with other types of skin cleansing machines , but overall he liked the results and will continue to use it every morning before shaving
2	i had really high expectations for this product , as i have heard lots of raves for the obagi skincare line i used this product twice a day , every day \( per the instructions \) for 4 weeks but have seen no improvement in fact , it made my skin drier i now have these dry patches on either side of my mouth which is beginning to clear up now that i 've decided to stop using this product to be clear , it did not brighten my skin or in any way improve its appearance i have medium skin which is prone to hyperpigmentation i applied on areas with dark spots which did not lighten at all i have a feeling that for this product to be effective , it has to be used with the entire line a little goes a long way so apply carefully the smell is unpleasant to me what i would characterize as but it does go away after a few minutes one thing to note is that you must be religious about sunscreen i used sunscreen in the morning but forgot to put it on in the afternoon before my one hour walk i noticed that my skin was red sunburnt later that day and i do n't usually burn this product does make your skin more sensitive to the sun so do n't forget to protect it !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	i think there are better products for less money i do n't like the way it makes my hair feel i do n't wash my hair everyday so the second day my hair feels a little rough and the texture seems to almost separate strands of my hair
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
4	love the color ! does n't wear as well as some other brands
3	i do n't see any change in my skin nor has anyone commented on any change it smells wonderful , but it does n't seem to make any difference whether i use it or not
5	i ca n't imagine life without this toner i 've honestly never been a believer in toners , until i felt that i had to do something about my skin my skin was constantly dry , blemishes were a weekly occurrence and i had dark spots from previous blemishes that formed discolorations a friend recommended this and it has made such a huge difference i rarely ever have breakouts and my skin is smooth and always fresh feeling i use this at least 2 times per day \( mostly because of how amazing and refreshing it feels \) i recently had dry patches of skin around my nose and chapped lips from a very bad cold , and mario badescu products helped tremendously there was no burning feeling , which really showed me how gentle this toner was over all , this is one of my greatest finds and i love this \( and other mario badescu \) products
5	i get lots of compliments when i wear this shade very elegant for a night out , and i liked using it as a base , and applying a lighter brighter pink to my tips for a reverse french ombre effect
5	love the color , i'm a fan of the product
4	i had a very difficult time getting la roche posay redermic c anti aging fill in care for normal combination skin , 1 35 ounce to come out , though i have n't figured out why the is good not to thick , creamy or runny it goes on smooth and evenly the fragrance is nothing special , neither too strong or too weak the results are good i love that you can put it on any time , day or night description visibly plumps skin and visibly reduces the appearance of wrinkles suitable for sensitive skin benefits moisturizes , visibly plumps skin , help restore firm feel visibly reduces the look of lines and wrinkles suggested use after thoroughly cleansing skin , apply to face and neck morning and or evening product description redermic c plumps , fills and visibly reduces wrinkles formulated with a powerful combination of 01 hyaluronic acid , 5 pure vitamin c , and to visibly reduce the effects of aging anti aging innovation suitable for sensitive skin brand story recommended by more than 25 , 000 dermatologists worldwide , la roche posay offers unique skincare developed with dermatologists for every skin type to complement treatments and promote good skincare practices at home every day
2	for some reason this product burned my face when i applied it , could be because my skin is sensitive but im sure it will work for others \)
5	this is a calming cream i always keep some on hand as it really works it smells good and is very creamy the product was well packaged and arrived on time
4	this julep eyeshadow in coconuts and cabanas was soft , smooth and applied without any chalky or i love the shimmer , which adds dimension but does n't sit in my creases pigment wise this set is nice , but on the lighter side i do n't mind , since with neutrals like this sometimes a sheer wash is easier to work with that said , both colors built up nicely there is a bit of dust fallout in the compact , but not on my face , i just use a lighter hand when picking up the shadow with my brush i really like the compact though there is no applicator , the mirror is bigger than the average and the pans are a nice size it feels like velvet rubber , and even after dropping it 's been sturdy i usually think nail polish when i think julep , but their line of color cosmetics is making me rethink that high quality , and decent pricing
5	purple is my favorite color and after researching tons of colors , i liked this on my hands best it 's rich
5	i 've had to try a lot of different sensitive skin anti some are sensitive but do n't protect or this one does both and it smells really good , too !
2	gave this a try as i am still in search of my jane replacement of golden glow i need something with more olive in the summer and this is not it i found the powder to feel soft on my fingers but applied rough chalky and really showed up my pores it seems a bit shiny on my face though it sure looked matte in the compact the shade was a bit dark on me as well though it 's a dermablend product , i felt it did not offer much build able coverage to wear alone as foundation
3	i am used to paying premium prices for premium cosmetics and perfume , if it is worth the cost while i like the look and feel of this product , i feel it is priced well above what it delivers for the amount you receive it made my skin feel smooth and look more uniform , but i would spend my money on porefessional rather than buy this product putting half on one side of my face and half of the vl on the other , porefessional has better qualities and can be worn solo for a more even skin tone without a full face of foundation under bb cream and foundation they were tied as a base layer there are a lot of great primers out there and i think it is vital that a gal go to the department store or sephora and try them on in person before purchasing online every formula is different and testing many makes a big difference in finding the perfect one for your skin i used to work a cosmetics counter in college and i can recommend updating your whole routine every few years because your skin changes as you age and what worked great for you at 27 may not be the best any more at 33 tip to create a flattering finish on your face after applying all your cosmetics , spray a fine mist of water on your face you can buy a can of aerosol evian , or you can get a travel sized bottle for hairspray and fill it from your or other filtered water this makes your face look more youthful by putting a microscopic dew layer on the surface that is present in young skin , in the light your skin and face will look fresher and more natural
5	i have thick wavy hair and this iron works great for me it gets really hot and does a wonderful job of smoothing out my waves and adding nice soft curl to my hair i was on the fence about whether to purchase this product or the chi brand curling iron i love my chi flat iron and was worried i would not get similar results with this brand i'm so very glad i went with the hot tools brand the price is significantly cheaper but the results are equal
5	my husband has used jack black products in the past and has always been satisfied this is no different ! the product is non greasy , goes on smooth and vanishes quickly the product is white , but disappears there is no scent to this product which is nice because it does n't interfere with after shave cologne scents the product leaves your face feeling clean , not heavy or pasty this works well after shaving , or washing your face especially after being in the sun he did not notice his face feeling any tighter or less damaged in regards to wrinkles , but would recommend this as a good moisturizer
5	this is a very exotic smelling body cream , me and my 6 year old daughter are in love with it the cream has the right consistency , very easy to apply , keeps body moisturized , not at all sticky , and absorbs completely into the skin my family is so much into fragrances , always buys new perfumes , scented body lotions , mists , sprays etc and i got to say that this new fragrance is a keeper i love round containers , they are quite convenient , and gives me the feeling of luxury the body cream comes in a very nice size , would last me long time , would definitely recommend to all the scent loving girls out there
4	this is a very nice , gentle cleansing oil and no scent that i can pick up on it does a good job getting off what little makeup i do wear and leaves it feeling soft even without adding some moisturizer the only downside to this as opposed to other cleansers i 've used , is the way it is dispensed i prefer something with a pump and also this has to go onto a cotton ball or pad and then rubbed on the face as opposed to pumping and washing with water the also separates so the bottle needs a vigorous shaking prior to each use and might be a bit more fuss than every consumer is looking for , especially at that price ymmv
5	i use this facial moisturizer for daytime skin care this product comes with a pump and the 1 7 oz size months of use if used daily i absolutely love the ingredients which are perfect for moisturizing skin in a harsh climates with too much heat or too much cold ingredients glycerin , caprylic capric triglyceride , shea butter , stearic acid , glycine \( soybean \) , avocado oil and mango seed butter i combine this moisturizer with obagi 's hydrate luxe moisture rich cream at night for pm skin care which has similar products but more moisture since it is a cream not a lotion it is important to mention that this moisturizer dies not have spf so i apply obagi sunscreen cream on my face for protection from harmful uv rays this lotion is lightweight and will not clog pores it is suitable for all skin types and it retains moisture for prolonged periods of time \( up to 8 hours \) it is not tinted so one can use tinted spf or powder bronzer for more color on the face
5	best product i 've tried completely worth the money which is a lot but how can you compare 70 to looking stunning for a month or 2
2	pros this wo n't clump ! cons it wo n't clump because the formula is basically black water ! the big brush has been well covered in other reviews , but sometimes big brushes can be great the problem here is that the brush is that spiral kind with tight , fake hair think a giant sized version of the 1 e l f mascara i personally like bristle wands because of how they grab the lashes , but the newer plastic kind has it place this one finds a weird , unhappy medium i miss l'oreal , as i think light formulas can be fabulous for avoiding clumps this is n't just lightweight , it 's literally the consistency of water even with careful application , this little black dots under my eyes and onto my eyelids every time this stuff does n't seem to love lashes , but they love the skin around them ! if this was a 5 mascara , i 'd recommend it to people who wanted more of a tint and maybe the illusion of length \( its lash loading but did n't make my lashes look any thicker , but did n't do a bad job making them look longer \) but is n't worried about thickness even using multiple applications between the lashes drying just seemed to trace over the lashes , but never built thickness at 20 , it 's absolutely ridiculous that it has the problems it has right now i'm using a makeup forever mascara and a 5 revlon grow luscious plumping mascara i picked up on a whim , and both prove you can do much better than this in every price point
5	i used evian water face spritzer in the past and did not notice any beneficial effects from it avene thermal spring water spray works so much better i 've noticed how my face feels soft only just a few minutes after spraying this product helps me manage my skin 's ultra sensitivity and allergies i also spray it on my body after a shower and do n't need to use a lot of lotion or moisturizer next time , i 'll buy the smaller can \( s \) since this big one is harder to use it keeps slipping out of my hand
5	this product is exactly as advertised arrived promptly thank you
5	hydrates without weighing hair down
3	meh this rod does work , but there 's absolutely nothing special about it it does come with a heat pad to set it down on and a glove to wear for wrapping the hair around the rod the cord rotates which is helpful i have very thick , long hair and this rod is n't really designed for my hair i can only do thin sections at a time about half the hair i can do with my traditional curling iron it took twenty minutes to get noticable curls in half my hair i just do n't have that sort of time to waste i would much rather be out having fun than spending forty minutes doing my hair the curls themselves are ok , but again , nothing special within an hour in the east texas humidity , they were looking more flat frizzy than like spiral curls for the three figure price tag , this just does not live up to expectations
5	i ordered this product without realizing that it was designed for men i thought i would try it out anyway and am glad i did i would recommend this product to men and women pros great price for a night cream \( why are women 's products so much more expensive \? \? \) gentle not sure of the actual glycolic acid content as it is n't specified , but i used this daily without any redness or irritation non greasy i did n't experience any break outs fragrance free effective great winter to test out this product , i woke up with noticeably softer and hydrated skin , on nights when i only slept 4 5 hours i would feel a little bit of the cream residue on my face when i washed my face in the morning but it did n't feel thick or greasy at all good amount the 4 ounces will last a long time , the thick formulation means you do n't have to use much cons ca n't think of any i noticed another reviewer mentioned using this product around his eyes and the he had good results i have n't done that because i am hesitant to use any glycolic acid on that very thin sensitive skin underneath my eyes overall , i highly recommend this product and will purchase in the future due to the value and effectiveness
5	traditionally , i use a pencil or crayon type eyeliner this was my first real serious try with liquid liner i think i tried it once when i was in college \( rock was the rage \) , but it was awkward , a little messy and took longer than the pencil but now , years later , when offered the opportunity to try this product for my honest opinion , i thought why not \? i do n't regret it and overall , im pleased with bliss on the line liquid liner after a little a was able to line my eyes without looking like a clown the applicator is thin but you can make a thicker bolder line by the applicator what i liked \( 1 \) this eyeliner dries quickly and doesnt smear \( at least not that i noticed \) i did n't get raccoon eyes and had a pretty polished look \( 2 \) this liner comes off easily i simply use a gentle face cleanser and it comes off pretty easily \( 3 \) this product doesnt irritate the eye so why not 5 stars well , there is one drawback \( 1 \) this liquid liner is a little pricey \( 0 fl oz for approximately 24 \) and while i like the product , i am a little torn as a consumer on a budget , i am not sure if i would purchase this product , especially if i can find a comparable product at my local drug or discount store i would have a hard time the cost
3	at first i was apprehensive when i saw how white this was it looks clown makeup white reminds me of corn starch but it does go on completely transparent i applied it over bb cream , and while it did give a matte finish , it made my skin look too dry and dull it 's a high quality product it just did n't suit me
2	the curling iron is made of two parts that you are supposed to connect , and you can buy and connect different barrels unfortunately , mine broke when i was trying to connect the two pieces the barrel part that goes inside cracked when i tried to lock it now there is a big crack along the part of the barrel that goes inside of the handle it is all plastic in there , and apparently , it cracks way too easy i called the company they hung up after a few minutes of wait i went online , and was able to write to them from there it says i will receive a response within two business days , but they are still to get warranty repair or replacement you need to have the number which is conveniently located on the outside of the box and nowhere else , so you can inadvertently throw it away and possibly be left without warranty the website states that for warranty you have to have the silver sticker with the number still attached , they do not specify what is it supposed to be attached to , though the website also states that if your product is going to be replaced under warranty , you should send it to them first \( it does not say who will pay for it \) , and they will mail you another one three weeks i seriously dislike all this kinds of tricks aside from being broken now , the iron looks very attractive the cable is long and swivels easily so it will not be tangled up with use to exchange barrels , you most definitely have to wait until the one you were using cools down , which probably means you are not going to use two different barrels to make the same
4	skinmedica is a line of medicated skin care products that previously could only be purchased with a prescription from a plastic surgeon or medical spa this product , the rejuvenating hydrator , is designed to moisturize , and smooth away fine lines and wrinkles it has an interesting texture , as it is a really light serum but still feels like a gel , but it provides so much hydration that your skin feels like you 've applied a heavy , silky cream there is a faint , medicinal , clean scent to it it arrives protected and presented in a heavy display type box , and a large , sleek silver dispenser that is a bit deceiving , considering there 's only 2oz of product within the amazon description recommends to wet your fingers before applying to face and neck \( though that is not mentioned on the box or product \) twice daily , both in the am and pm application is smooth and not greasy , and only a little bit is needed i have been using it for about a week , and it does give your skin a beautiful glow , and seems to plump up skin so wrinkles disappear it is definitely a luxury beauty item , with good results
5	i love this gloss the color is light and easy to wear and stays put without smearing or getting sticky i packed it around in my purse for two weeks in the las vegas summer heat and it did n't separate or turn gummy the is angled , giving better control for coverage it has a nice subtle fruity scent , that does n't me with a teeny tooty frooty aroma very much a five star hit i 'll be looking for some other colors to add to my makeup bag
5	this is one of my favorite colors from essie i have been looking for a pale pink nail color for awhile and pink glove service is just perfect ! you have to paint at least two coats before you can see an obvious difference , as it is so sheer perfect for a french manicure as well as just wearing by itself i 've gotten many compliments on it \)
5	this is another great beauty product by l'occitane although on the expensive side , it only takes a little and it goes a long way this non greasy face cream does a wonderful job of smoothing your complexion without irritating your skin apply in the morning after your shower or washing your face for a smooth look all day long
5	perfect for fall winter !
4	i tested this and a friend tested it , just to give you two my hair is very fine , and it 's natural state is curls sometimes i do want to go straight and sleek though and that 's where this product comes in i used a half pump of the thick cream and spread it evenly through my damp hair and then styled , and for me , the frizz and flyaways i usually get stayed away the formula did not weigh my hair down or feel greasy , and i like the fresh scent my friend has a harder time with hair product she has medium thickness hair that is prone to static and is more noticeably frizzy especially on the top of her head she used this product on her damp hair and then blew it dry and still had a moderate degree of frizz \( though it did control the frizz better than most , she admitted \) so , basically , your may vary it worked well for me , not so well for my friend so try it , but perhaps do n't hope for a miracle if your hair is especially difficult
5	i would be super if i bought this based off of the online of the color this is not a subtle pink this is neon pink and i happen to love it to death ! this is genuinely my go to lipstick i like the color and i love the formula it can dry kind of fast so you need to work quickly it dries fast and stays put it does n't dry my lips out but it does transfer when eating drinking it does n't move around only lips though and the color stays very vibrant for hours i have tried a lot of liquid lipsticks and this is my favorite formula
4	strawberry smoothie is not what i would pick for a color by itself , but a good color for layering cnd polish to create a unique color
5	i am a self proclaimed pca addict \( in the best way \) my medicine cupboard resembles an aesthetician 's tray pca , exfoliating wash , toner , multiple serums , hydrators , eye cream , sun screens and lip serum \( this review \) it is the ultimate hydrator and a little goes a long way i use it once in the morning and again before bed we are experiencing really dry weather and this does the trick lip balms hydrate but tend to be waxy and do n't last very long on my lips other high end lip serums have been very sticky this one is perfect it leaves a very nice , slight shine but most importantly , it works really well i highly recommend this lip serum and i will happily purchase it again once my tube runs low
5	i 've been using retinol for many years and i have fewer age spots in the areas where i use it so this ingredient does make a difference both retinol and are made from vitamin a and it 's the best thing available to reduce wrinkles and age spots retinoids are the stronger variety that requires a prescription \( retin a , , etc \) retinol is the light duty variety that is good for daily use if you do n't want to bother with a prescription since retinol promotes the growth of healthy new cells , your skin can get sensitive with these baby cells exposed on the surface , so it is important to stay out of the sun or wear sunscreen when using this product it is also good to use a moisturizer this is the real product amazon is an authorized seller for skinmedica products
5	i have had oily , problem skin all my adult life pca is the very best facial wash i have ever used ! it is economical to use and takes care of that oily shine problem what a great product !
4	this curling iron really works on my hard to curl shoulder length hair the drugstore model i had bought does not perhaps it 's because this one can get so hot \( adjustable temp \) and or the metal it 's made with \( it 's heavier than the one from the drug store \) seems to be higher quality and it does not damage or my hair it works so well , the larger 1 1 2 version may have done the job , do n't know will stay with this one perhaps the slightly smaller , but still fairly large , barrel makes it so i do n't have to hold it as long , maybe requiring less heat \? the only thing i wish were different is that it does not have an automatic shut off , and i keep leaving it on by accident which would be a problem with young children in the house am wondering if the spare springs are needed because others do the same \? anyway , this curling iron has dramatically improved the look of my fine hair i use it to add body at the ends , not for curly curls , but am sure it would also work well for curlier styles update it 's almost four years since i wrote the review , and the curling iron is still going strong ! i carry the extra spring in my suitcase , and have n't needed it as of yet oh , and my husband got me an auto shutoff device that i plug into an outlet , and the curling iron into this , and so now i have auto shutoff ! \( except when travelling \) curling iron has been left on many times for up to 12 hours , and it still works amazing
5	i must have got a deal on amazon when i bought a four pack of these black , blue , pink dark pink i cannot recommend these enough i am addicted to washing my face with these these clothes with water alone remove all makeup even mascara no more rubbing at the delicate skin under my eyes just a gentle swipe and off it comes i give whichever one i'm using a periodic in the sink with some then just hang them to dry amazing what a using these clothes has been for me i 'll never go back to a regular washcloth on my face neck
2	after reading the good reviews i decided to give these a try i let them warm up for 10 15 minutes and the rollers felt barely warm i tried a second time , leaving them on for half an hour and they still did n't feel hot i tried one just to test it and the curl fell out immediately they 're very nice looking and come with clips , perhaps mine was a dud
5	my favorite face wash ! the best smell and a clean finish i sometimes use others but my face looks and feels the best when i use this product it 's my go to for face wash mens products are killing it !
5	love the color of this polish looks very elegant on my nails thick coating
5	beautiful color
4	it looks great and works well for a sized comb my dad just loves it ! simple and solid , a quality product
5	jouer essential lip enhancer claims to increase lip fullness and decrease fine lines and it appears to live up its claims for best results , jouer recommends applying the lip enhancer 3 times daily for 29 straight days while this product has not yet been used for the recommended 29 days , it has already noticeably positive results positive this lip enhancer leaves lip feeling soft and moist with a nice , natural sheen it has an excellent conditioning quality to it the product does eventually wear off , so the 3 daily applications are necessary to maintain the desired effect throughout the day the cream is thin , non greasy and applies evenly there was no noticeable fragrance or flavor to it negative jouer is a high end product offered by a few select retailers common only to large market areas my wife felt this was a problem in that she prefers the experience of potential cosmetic purchases with in store bottom line , my wife was very impressed with the jouer essential lip enhancer and believes it to be superior to other lip balms moisturizers shes used in the past she states her lips feel fuller and the glossy appearance enhances the fullness having spent a good amount of money over the years buying such products , she states jouer is now her go to lip enhancer
4	the facial spray by mario badescu smells wonderful \( if you like roses \) there is so much product in this , it 's cheap , and the ingredients are great i have been using this in the morning as a toner , it makes my pores feel tighter , and i 've been using it as a setting spray for my makeup definitely recommend
5	i love this shade cannot be without it
5	one of my favorite summer fragrances there are few scents that mix with the summer heat better than this one does
5	love zoya polish ! i use the base and top coat along with 2 coats of polish i can usually go 2 weeks without a chip and it is easy to remove the polish also knowing it is 5 free brings peace of mind !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	i have very thin hair on the top and front of my head i'm a 41 yr old female with female pattern baldness i have medium brown curly hair based on previous reviews i chose light brown i'm happy i did me because it blended perfectly to apply i found the spray applicator works best for me i dry and style my hair and then gently lift sections up and holding the sprayer 3 6 above my hair , give shallow to the shaft and 2 3 in length from my scalp then i lay the hair back in the desired style and generally mist the hair in the thinnest spots patting the hair to gently push it into the hair itself then light spray with hairspray i have also not used hair spray and it stayed in place as well it has never come off on my pillow or my clothes the only issue i have is getting too close to my scalp it can become dots in my bald spots if not careful if you have a small bald spot this would be fine , but my hair is so thin i would need a lot of product to cover my scalp toppik plumps the hair i have and my scalp in color to minimize my scalp showing my husband thinks it looks really natural he did n't know what i had done but kept saying how good my hair looked he was surprised when i told and showed him the product he had no idea it was fibers ! part of what really makes my hair look thicker is that this product is great to make your hairline part look thinner and thus making your hair appear fuller to keep a straight part line , lay a pipe cleaner on top of your part or use a piece of paper to cover the part line and then apply to toppik over the paper pipe cleaner you will be amazed how minimizing your part the look of your hair ! it 's a good solution with little effort depending in your type of thinning balding will determine if the product is successful for you the product does attach to the hair you have and does appear thicker and it does not come off until you wash it it did exactly what it promised to good luck !
5	love , love , love ! gorgeous color , lasts forever and get constant compliments best buy ever ! ! !
5	absolutely love this lip balm ! i had a same come from either birchbox or ipsy i cannot remember but i fell in love with the feeling you can always count on amazon for items as i bought two tubes from here ! !
4	i'm not ordinarily a fan of dark polishes , but sweep is a lovely color in some lights it has a green hue , in others it looks somewhat blue i love butter london ! !
4	it is good , but as the light moisturizer and refreshing use i want to give it throughout the day , i must say that i still rather the evian mineral water spray
4	well worth the money , and well constructed built to last i received a quality shave update i 've been using this razor a few months now , and my opinion remains that this is an excellent and well tool my only knock is that it 's very heavy in comparison to other safety razors with that being said control can be a bit challenging at various angles beneath the chin for example
5	i have light to medium skin i grabbed this ivory shade and the toast shade currently , the ivory is just a little light , but since it is summer , i have a bit of a tan , so this color will probably be perfect in the winter months when my tan has faded the coverage is great for every day use covers up my mild rosecea and keratosis pilaris on my face , but it is light feeling and leaves a matte finish
5	have used this product before when applied w the top coat , it is excellent my pedi lasts for 2 4 weeks
4	in the winter , my skin is even and normal in the summer months , i have a shiny , oily t zone it comes out thin and occasionally watery it absorbs quickly when i first smoothed it on , i thought there must be some mistake my skin was shinier than ever but once it dried , my skin did look smooth and mattified the effect doesnt last all day my skin did look better than it would have without this moisturizer , but i could see the shininess coming back after about four hours 4 stars its lightweight and smells great its the perfect moisturizer for me for summer
5	my stylist told me about toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be she purchased the 0 36oz 10 3g for me from the local beauty supply even with her discount it was almost 25 but i really liked how toppik camouflages my thin spots only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair only one person realized what the difference was , and only because she 'd also used toppik toppik is now a must have product for me so i started looking for a better bargain and found it here i get almost more than twice the product for only a few more i would definitely recommend toppik to anyone
4	love it
4	i 've used the new vinylux polish line at home and had it applied at the salon the salon manicures really did last the full week but mine at home did not the only difference was that i was not using the scrubfresh to prepare my nails first since the 1st of the 2 layers of vinylux polish has to have a really dry nail to absorb into , i think that the scrubfresh is a critical part of the cnd vinylux product line , which i strongly prefer over shellac since it can be easily removed at home and actually helps my nails stay strong and healthy however , i cannot recommend this seller my bottle arrived looking terrible from leakage that did not appear to have occurred during shipping and was not full so i had to return it
5	this is one of my favorite colors try it with the yellow additive it is awesome ! also great by itself
4	this is a very nice neutral color i had it done nail salon so they did 2 coats but i think it could use 3 to even it out
1	for a few more dollars i could 've gotten a much bigger bottle ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! content amount is not worth it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's a rip off
4	i have very fine hair and it is difficult to find a hairspray the holds my hair without being sticky but this spray does the trick \( as much as possible ! \) yes it is pricey but it does work
5	as exppected
5	this is very refreshing mineral spray ! i have been using now for years and nothing feels better then a quick spritz to wake me up and moisturize my skin it comes out in a very nice , perfect spray and is fine over makeup as it 's very light spritz i have been receiving these in monthly subscription boxes in smaller bottles which is nice on the go but the larger bottle is great for home use ! if you need a little pick me up , and your skin feels dry you wo n't be disappointed in this spray there are so many occasions it 's good for the list could go on forever !
2	vichy dermafinish comes in a medium sized squeeze tube , and the shade i received for testing was correct for my skin tone the foundation is creamy , smooth , and applies easily with fingers or makeup brush , and gives even coverage whether applied in a light , medium , or full layer unfortunately , vichy dermafinish did n't wear well during the day on dry patches , it flaked off \( ugh not a problem i ever have with my bare minerals complexion rescue \) , and on my cheeks it into every pore the foundation is a physical sunblock , of titanium dioxide , so it photographs poorly and changes color in different lighting it also includes dimethicone near the top of it 's ingredient list , so it would cause break outs for me or anyone else sensitive to silicones if you need the specialized coverage of vichy dermablend , you 'll love the texture and easy application , as well as the spf30 for normal coverage needs , there are better options
5	i hope they make this product for a long time my hair has thinned out a lot , with this product you can not tell if you are thinning , this well make you feel better and look great , really ! i will buy it until something better comes along
5	image really delivers what it says i use this along with their other products and find them all to work very well with my skin this is one of my favorites for the face wash
5	i have begun to pay so much more attention to my skin as of late due to the fact i am now 37 and have always been a sun \( and sometimes the tanning bed too bad girl \) i really like this bronzer because it looks very natural while covering imperfections the best way to your face is to use a light highlighter right under your eyes and then suck your cheeks in and put the bronzer in that or regular blush can then be used on your cheek apples this makeup line seems very competitive with high end brands and i recommend it
4	i like josie eau do parfum the scent is nice , though a tad too strong for me after spritzing a very small amount behind my ears and cleavage , then my wrists over cleavage , rubbing wrists together , i approached my husband to get his opinion he did not care for it well , he wo n't be wearing it anyway ! lol \( he prefers a much lighter floral fragrance on me , such as air temps \) josie 's fragrance is made up of a jasmine \( national flower of philippines \) , asian pear , bergamot \( also found in my favorite earl grey tea \) , freesia , and orchid , plus the usual other ingredients that are there to and keep it fresh this is a perfume that seems to be more for evening wear , than morning and during the day it 's been about 5 hours since i applied it , and i can still catch a whiff on my wrists rather pleasant , i think so i would say let it linger a while before going out it is referred to , as being a vibrant mix of being confident , sexy , and delivering a energy i guess i'm just a little to quiet and mellow , so i 'll wear it occasionally with caution
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	excellent product works as advertised and is consistent with other 5 star amazon reviewers experience
5	love this spray ! it does n't irritate my skin or make it break out , and it feels cooling and soothing in a very dry environment
4	great color , a good summer go to shade
5	another winning product from dermablend high quality ingredients , easy to apply and long lasting
4	i mainly use tanning mousses to mitigate tan lines on my body having used several different tanning products over this years , i find the xen tan fresh tanning mouse work a little better it gives me a natural looking tan without any hint of an orangey tone that i sometimes get from other tanning products though it still makes skin blemishes stand out with a darker tone \( i have yet to find a tanning product that does n't \) it is simple and easy to apply a mitt is included with the product for my review i do n't believe it is included in the retail product but instead sold separately as nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href deluxe tanning mitt dp b002uoctsu ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 deluxe tanning mitt a i follow the instructions carefully , apply it with the mitt and let it air dry it has a sweet scent that reminds me of cotton candy , which is nice when you wait for it to dry on your skin the tan tends to be light , so re application is needed for a darker tan my only quibble is that it is n't tinted and you have to wait for the color to develop on your skin , so it is easy to miss a spot or two during application all in all , this is a nice tanning mousse it is easy to apply with their tanning mitt and the resulting tan does n't look fake at all it is n't perfect as i still get a streak here and there sometimes but it may have to do with my skin than anything else i like it so far
5	this is a high end luxury brush that truly delivers there are two things you need to know when you 're ready to buy a mason pearson brush of any sort one is the size full size \( the largest size \) , handy \( medium sized \) , or pocket \( the smallest size \) this is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept \( say , in your handbag \) , but because of the bristle length of the various sizes the smaller sizes have shorter bristles the bristles have to be able to reach your scalp , and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair if you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair , you 'd do better with a larger size the other consideration is the bristle type do you want all nylon , like this detangler \? even though the detangler is all nylon , some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter , just like the mixed bristle brush it 's hard to see in the picture you should know that the detangler is the only mason pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair all of the larger mason pearson brushes , including this one , come with a bristle brush , so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush the detangler is a brush just like the other brushes , not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing it is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also even though my hair is very short , it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick this handy size is about eight inches long it 's quite a large expense to buy any mason pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items it 's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment but it 's worth it if you 're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie , then you can justify the cost that 's how we did it \) for additional information on mason pearson visit their web site at masonpearson dot com highly recommended
5	davines is one of my favorite hair care brands , so i was super excited to try this the bottle is small but has lasted me a surprisingly long time \( my hair is midway down my back \) , i put it in my hair after it 's towel dried and helps detangle it and leaves it incredibly soft will definitely repurchase
3	tried the moisturizer this morning was disappointed that you are supposed to keep away from the eyes and that 's what gets super dry on my face still looking for the ultimate eye cream this one is also not supposed to be used on breakouts so we 'll see if the other products resolve the skin issues and then we 'll let the teens try the moisturizer
4	yes , the older i get the drier my hair gets making it hard to manage not to mention looking good i often wash my hair before i go to bed , in the morning its frizzy and all over the place wow goes best on dry hair , you only need a small dab , work it in and your hair as you like it using a hair drier and a brush \( i find my boar bristle hair brush works best \) style your hair as you wish and if you have the same results you 'll have shinny hair thats come alive , its not greasy or oily just smooth shinny hair that looks like you spent a lot more time getting it to look so good i understand its safe for dyed hair too so if you do n't have lots of time and want your hair looking fresh and smooth this might be worth a try
5	i got this same machine out of a large well known mail order i 've had mine for two years and it has worked perfectly i use a new tip after every five uses , and i always do my arms and hands when i do my face i found i ca n't use high suction without redness which lasts over twenty four hours on my face so now i use it on the lowest suction the redness still lasts over two hours i have very mild rosacea i use only the fine tips it does n't do anything for wrinkles but it smooths the surface skin beautifully it keeps blackheads and whiteheads almost non on my slightly oily skin i do n't need to wear any foundation at all thanks to this as my skin looks better without it i sometimes use peter thomas roth skin peel pads before i use this if i want an extra smoothing it takes at least five uses before you start to see lasting improvements i do n't recommend using this more often than every week it is a very harsh thing to do to your skin , scraping off the top two layers as it does your skin needs at least a week to regenerate i also do not advise using anything at all on your skin for twenty four hours after you use this as you have removed the outer acid and anything you put on your skin will sink to the deeper layers ladies , those are chemicals in all those creams and moisturizers , and your skin ca n't keep them out of your body after the acid is removed this is just my opinion on this i do n't want chemicals sinking into my skin when it is raw i had a dry patch of skin between my eyebrows and after three treatments with this it 's gone the tips get dull very fast they are nice and sharp at first and do the job perfectly but when you are using them after they are dull it 's more painful and harsh on your skin only five uses and i'm ready for a new one i have n't had any problems with loss of suction i think most women will be pleased with this it definitely makes your skin softer and smoother with weekly use always use sunscreen when you are using this
1	the name of this shade is clearly pink they should have left the pink off this has absolutely no color it may make a great shiny polish , but the packaging and the name are way off base i feel deceived and wish i could have my money back
5	great for sunset nail designs !
4	pretty color
5	whether you like a perfume or not is such an individual preference , it 's impossible for words to tell you if you 're going to like it , especially as it blends with your own body chemistry a quick glance through the reviews on amazon \( and elsewhere \) of calvin klein eternity aqua \( and every other fragrance \) proves that some women adore , while others loathe , the very same product that said , i got this for my wife , who is a mature woman \( not in the trendy 20 something youthful market \) she has had a few weeks to try this perfume while we move into the warmer months her analysis is that she enjoys it , finds it refreshing and not overpowering , and feels it is her daytime , go to , summer scent as one of her choices for going out in the evening , she prefers calvin klein euphoria i happen to like the euphoria better , both in scent and the bottle itself a little more creative in design it 's hard to beat those for description ! a fragrance like a clean crisp ocean breeze top notes white peony , crisp pink lady apple and cucumber water mid notes tiare , magnolia , gardenia , jasmine base notes woods , cedarwood , transparent musk those things are important to read ! i saw one woman 's review where she said she hated it , because it smelled like peonies lol ! the first top note is white peony , so if you despise the flower , you are not going to like this perfume ! in fact , both my wife and i note the apple as a highlight this fades after an hour or so to more of the mid notes , which include flowers we both enjoy , including magnolia , gardenia and jasmine some other reviewers hate something woody in the base notes not our experience cedar and light musk are both fine by the way , calvin klein 's fragrance line is famous for eternity this won a coveted award as the top women 's fragrance back in the late 's it was into the fragrance hall of in you could be for thinking that eternity aqua is something similar not so ! they were created by different perfume makers and have little other than \( part of \) a name in common i was a little surprised to learn that the male versions of these eau de also bear nothing other than name relationship , also made by other designers therefore , if you like eternity , you will have to try eternity aqua for yourself , as it has no scent relationship to it 's famous older sister you might not know or even care that calvin klein has not owned his perfume companies for a long time the ck fragrance lines used to be owned by , which owns dollar brands including axe , dove , , 's , , , and even ben and 's ice cream , just to barely scratch the mega surface in , calvin klein fragrances were acquired by cosmetic giant , coty , inc coty also owns , chloe , davidoff , marc jacobs , and even coty also sells you the beauty products by , , kate moss , , lady , vera wang , , guess , and a whole of celebrities very big business indeed ! just thought you 'd find that interesting ! eternity aqua \( for women \) an aquatic floral scent recommended with this caveat you 'll have to try it for yourself
5	like sex for your eyes ! it feels so amazing ! i have dryer under eyes and after a night with this cream i 'll never go to sleep without it !
5	my wife and i were both very pleased with this scent , in fact it has become my wife 's go to daily wear perfume the perfume itself has a very pleasant and mild oriental scent , with great sillage and a delicious smelling dry down there is some citrus and some floral , and the whole thing is nicely balanced and very feminine the perfume is pricey , but within reason for a quality name brand its rare that we both like a scent equally , so five stars from us !
5	i loooove essie polishes they wear great , do n't chip , and have dozens and dozens of colors you ca n't find anywhere else this color is vibrant and has the tiniest and i mean tiny amount of sparkle to it it is a great go to color for when you ca n't decide at the salon for all ages ! \) i highly recommend this one , ladies \)
5	love this stuff more every day not harsh like other exfoliators and makes me feel clean and my skin very soft definitely recommend this and the facial exfoliator both great products for a great price however , be clear on reasonable expectations specifically , this scrub is not physically going to eliminate sagging skin that expectation is simply unreasonable
5	love the color it 's a dark charcoal
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i pray that skyn never stops making this ! i am in my 40s and have had mild acne issues my entire adult life this is a lightweight , fragrance free lotion that i use every morning and sometimes at night also it does n't feel tingly other lotions i 've tried have caused my acne to get worse , and i will forever use this !
5	i really like this good feel and foams nicely
5	this is a great summer polish for toes and fingers , but i mostly wear it on my toes it 's a great shade of pink that does n't clash with anything else you might be wearing and essie pretty much wo n't chip \( at least on your toes \) for at least a week great great color !
5	this is a really impressive cleanser it 's very , very gentle , but still effective at cleaning it took a little getting used to at first , but mostly because i did n't realize how much i was used to having dried out skin which then has to be moisturized it foams up a lot , so a little goes a long way please note that this review is for the cleanser on its own , but in reality , this is part of a system , so be prepared to buy half a dozen other products along with this , such as the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href obagi nu derm fx system normal to dry 7 count dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 obagi nu derm fx system normal to dry , \( 7 count \) a nbsp and use this to replace the cleanser as needed please also note that the nu derm fx system available on amazon does not contain hydroquinone , which is part of another obagi system \( refer to their website \) and requires a prescription my wife has had great success with another obagi system , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href obagi clenziderm dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 obagi clenziderm a , in the past it 's one of the few systems that actually helped clear up her skin without irritating her sensitive skin she does n't really use the clenziderm anymore because she would prefer natural systems , but i'm not knocking a star off because it has sls , and they have proven to be very effective
5	the color is true to the picture ! i think it 's a perfect color for fall , and i received the product a day before my expected delivery date ! i am very pleased
5	this perfume is perfect for the spring going into summer weather right now it is an interesting fragrance combination of fresh and floral that works really well together and can be playful , sophisticated , and feminine all at once meaning it can be worn day to night and on the weekends , too it 's got high notes that remind me of breezy linen freshness over a sweet floral body one does not overpower the other and does n't give me or my husband headaches and it does n't have any low notes like musky , woodsy , or spicy aromas pulling it down some complain that this perfume does n't last long but in my experience i think perfumes that do n't have the low notes seem to not last as long because it 's usually the musk , woods , and spices that really cling after the high notes other smells fade this is not a problem for me at all and i actually think this perfume fades to a really nice floral scent that is pretty and super soft but if you want to smell the way the perfume smells out of the bottle all day long , just reapply throughout the day i would recommend this to anyone who likes oceanic linen floral perfumes also i would recommend to those who like citrusy perfumes but want to try something more floral but worried that they ca n't stand the overly floral stuff
5	i have very sensitive skin and this is the only product that my face does not breakout to or get a reddish irritation from after use i have been using products for over ten years and the products are fantastic and not expensive to use like a lot of products out on the market amazon has very good prices on all the products
4	this review is for the beige color variety that is been seen to be combined with 11 more different types of full coverage foundation makeup amazon shipped the product promptly and arrived safely it was tested and i am pleased to report that my daughter likes it the color was as expected , it was easy to apply and one application lasts the whole day this product did not cause any skin irritation the full coverage foundation makeup also includes a mirror and the plastic is sturdy and does not break easily rating with four stars !
2	i was interested in this product because it says for all hair types and i wondered if it would make my medium fine hair more under control and healthier looking especially during muggy , windy or very dry days the oil has a scent that is pleasant but a little too strong for me i put it on very conservatively as directed , blow dried my hair as usual and my hair looked limp \( but shiny ! \) my guess is this would work well for curly , coarse , or maybe even thick straight hair it is just not for fine and straight
4	good looking tanner that dries fast it does not last as long as they claim though my wife has needed to reapply every 3 days almost on the dot it looks good and does not smell it is a quality self tanning product but just know you will have to reapply quite often which can become costly at 30 a can
4	i 've been hearing a lot about the korean ten step beauty routine these days and , in an effort to maintain my skin , have been trying to expand on my fairly minimal skincare regimen in the past few years lately , i 've been alternating between two night creams a high end brand , le de , and a drug store brand , l'oreal age perfect both are very emollient and attractively fragranced , leaving my skin feeling smooth and moisturized in the morning the vichy liftactive supreme is right in between le and l'oreal in terms of price so i was interested to see how it would compare i 've been using it exclusively for a week and , so far , i really like it the cream itself is a bit thicker than the other two so i was able to use less , but it was also not quite as easy to smooth over my face and neck due to the dense texture the fragrance is lovely , but very strong it smells distinctly perfume y going on and dries down to a lingering talc like scent personally , i like it very much but if you do n't enjoy fragrance in your facial products , this is definitely not the moisturizer for you most importantly , it improved the appearance of my skin tone and texture after a good night 's sleep i think i might even go as far as to say it works better than both of my current after seven days i ca n't vouch for any firming properties , but as a moisturizer , i give it high marks good value for a mid priced cream
5	this product looks natural , stays in place , and works to cover the scalp and thicken my thin , fine , hair i use it everyday
4	i normally use a primer before applying makeup primers help makeup go on easier and gives you a better look i was really surprised to receive the vincent longo primer in such a small tube especially for the price ! the directions say to just use a pearl size amount which would make the tube last a longer when i first used it i thought it was silicone based , but it 's silicone free , fragrance free and oil free this alone is a plus for my combination skin it goes on smoothly , as expected the primer helps with uneven skin tone and wrinkles this particular brand worked even better then others i 've tried maybe the fact that it 's non comodogenic \( something i need with breakouts \) and the fact that it helps your skin breathe had something to do with it all i know is that my skin glowed i do n't know if i would actually buy it for 44 , but i might use it sparingly for special occasions when i want to look my best
4	la roche posay makes very high quality products with quality ingredients this is a very good product but is better for some uses than others if you want to use this for sun protection , its great it gives a nice even texture and a natural but better look the color happens to work perfectly for me too it does not have a heavy scent it can also be used as a primer under makeup and that is where i think it loses something everyone has different skin types and likes , but for me it seemed a bit heavy thick for a primer it definitely cleaned up some imperfections , but i prefer something smoother with a more moisturizing feel i am older and my skin is starting to dry so that may be part of the reason it felt dry it really deserves 4 5 stars
5	i have this shade already and i still absolutely love it
5	love davines products , especially this scent happy to find it through amazon !
5	i used to use a more expensive serum but then tried jack black 's and i found it to be just as good it is a little expensive still
1	i bought a couple mitts on amazon and they were thick and the tanner application was effortlessly flawless these are not like those i was expecting the same thick 2 sided mitts but these are extremely thin and more like a foam material they do n't apply self tanner well and i was covered in streaks i'm so disappointed in this one !
4	i ordered this product from the vine program because i am one of those people who have acne and wrinkles ! i have breakouts during that time of the month and i thought that it would be good to try this product because it included a cleanser , light moisturizer and the glycolic acid pads on the first evening that i used the pads , i noticed a stinging and tightening sensation on my face the next morning i noticed that there seemed to be a slight irritation on my forehead and cheeks the next evening , i cut the pads in half and i used only half of the pad for my entire face and the backs of my hands that seemed to cut the irritation down and i also noticed a decrease in the size of the pimples on my lower jawline the backs of my hands also looked smoother after five or so days i will have to give another update after finishing the entire bottle of cleanser , but after one week of using the entire system , my skin is a bit clearer and i even have smoother looking hands
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
5	ok this is an amazing mask i have tried a lot of hydrating masks , lotions , overnight creams and nothing has done what this has done for my skin ! the consistency is not like a lotion or cream it 's bouncy gel cream that 's pink there is a very , very light scent and it goes on very smooth not heavy at all i have sensitive skin and had zero reactions , which is a big deal for me it 's hard finding products that do n't give me some sort of reaction waking up the next morning my skin literally feels smooth , soft glowy ! this stuff is so great it 's pricey , but wow , the product works ! i 'll have to save up to keep this one around would highly recommend !
5	i have been using this cleaning brush for a month and i love it it looks nice , the blue and flowers are so pretty , yet it is light and easy to use too i feel like it is really deep cleaning , not damaging my skin it is is to charge up and after you are done using it , it rinses clean easily too
5	i have always been a fan of eternity perfume but , this aqua is a beautiful change to the standard version i love the scent it is a crisp , clean summer scent very refreshing subtle enough that you are not knocking everyone over , yet nice enough that people ask , what is that perfume \? it 's really nice cannot get much better than that with a fragrance great value for the price , as well highly recommend !
5	grand kids love it and relaxes them at night so do i the smell of course is incredible will buy always there products wish they would bring grape seed back
3	what struck me most about the scent is how sweet smelling it is , almost overwhelmingly so there are floral undertones , not fruity but the scent reminds me of older ladies on the plus side , the scent definitely lasts and does n't smell cheap my mom enjoyed it
4	i got the bronze corrector stick and it glides on easily and required only a thin smoothing to help cover imperfections in my facial skin i put just a thin layer on my hand , where i have light skin and dark age spots and i can visually see the difference just in the light covering i have a pinkish skin tone and the bronze has a yellowish tint it feels satiny and i do like this corrector stick
5	i shave friday morning , relax over the weekend , and wake up with three days of stubble on morning this is what i grab the slanted head creates a effect which through the hairs you wo n't feel a thing , even with significant growth if you have been using des , this is an adjustment , but an easy one it will take some time to get used to the angles and blade exposure , but you will pick it up after a shave or two just hold it and angle it like your des and shave normally it is not as aggressive as advertised just more efficient the second de razor i have bought and my first slant razor
5	i 've bought this several times , i'm 1 la roche buyer because is the best out of all treatments i 've used ! buy it with confidence
2	the first time i heard about stainless steel soap was years ago when it was advertised to for taking fish odors off of hands after fish cleaning now they are touted for their ability to remove garlic and onion odors off of hands so i finally gave it a try the soap came with instructions to rub it between your hands like regular soap , under cold running water for 30 40 seconds i tried it after cutting up onions , and after garlic i must say that after my hands warmed up from 30 40 seconds of cold water washing with it , the odor was a little less potent , but by no means eliminated others have had good results , but my experience was less than that i do n't know the behind why this should work to remove odors all i know is it did n't do that much to remove odors from my hands perhaps it is a question of body chemistry for efficacy two stars for results that were not so good
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i 've used this product for several years and love it ! it 's great and worth the money my skin has improved using this product
5	there are no words for this product this is the best thing that has entered my life recently ! made a huge in my nails and i am telling you all do not buy regular nail files from the store , this is much smoother and you only file lightly going in one direction life saver nail saver and i will always buy opi crystal nail file it is daunting looking for a legit crystal glass file but this is thee one update 8 27 16 still using the same one and my review remains the same ! ! !
1	i use this creme often and i buy it from amazon it is one of the few products i really love and agrees with my skin however , the texture and smell of the last jar i bought from this seller is completely different from the normal ones i can tell almost immediately that the product does not act the same on my skin i have had one other experience similar and amazon returned it
5	five stars
5	love it this really works !
5	saw this color featured in several magazines , and was happy to see it available here the color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors stunning with grays , jewel tones , and a real pop with black i like essie because it stays on nicely without chipping essie always has the perfect updated colors this color will look great with whatever you wear this winter \( the lace is on \) also bought another 2013 color , vested interest this is a lovely matte color , a greenish gray , that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors love the slightly edgy vibe , but super wearable , and looks fabulous on short nails
1	i'm not one that is overly picky with accents , but these jack black face pads were unusable for me because of their odor i have other jack black products , like beard lube , and love how it smells however these peel pads smell almost like rose water , which is very off putting for a man my wife agreed they smell lingered on my face after using unfortunately i ca n't speak to their effectiveness , because i did n't use for longer than a week \( 3 applications \) on the plus side , they did not burn or irritate my skin \( just offended my nose \)
3	the first thing you may notice about josie natori body cream is the weight , 6 8 oz , and the large size of the jar this will last a long time the top of the jar has an interesting design black and white squares with red flowers creeping up the side the of the lid is black and the jar is transparent , with the pale , powdery peach color of the cream , visible natori body cream is light its absorbency time is average it leaves the skin feeling soft and moisturized the scent lingers for me , natori has the scent of menthol combined with other scents , perhaps a light baby powder , perhaps sandalwood , but for me , menthol was predominant others have the scent as exotic and sultry it reminded me of being a child with a cold when my mother rubbed a vapor rub on my chest the ingredient list on the black and white box is extensive update and scent was still strong after six hours with only a scant application you may want to apply your usual scent more moderately as this body cream seems to act like a cream perfume some will love this , but some will not i felt it was important to include this information in my review natori body cream costs 58 00 perhaps someone more sophisticated than me can tell me why
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
5	i am using my husbands account but i cannot say how much i love this bronzer ! ! ! the color is so pretty \( with a light hand \) i am kinda fair skinned and i have to use a light hand but it 's such a beautiful color just enough shimmer to make it elegant but not overdone with all bronzers , you have to know what your doing or it will look really bad , but when this is done right , it ca n't be beat ! ! i am sure this will last me a long time but i will purchase more once it s gone if i knew they would discontinue it before i run out i would order more now , thats how much i love this product ! ! !
5	like many other acne control preparations , this is a salicylic acid based product in that regard , i would judge it to be no better and no worse than other acne control products though this one is a lot more expensive what makes this product better than its rivals is that it has some nice overall toning effects after using it only a few times , i can attest that skin looks brighter , and feels smoother because it is a lotion and not a cream , it also does n't feel thick and icky on your face update with longer continued use , both the acne control and toning effects of this lotion are even better \( moved rating to 5 stars \)
1	this may be a great product by i could n't get past the perfume it is very strongly scented i'm a little sensitive to fragrance and i knew it would bother me if i used it sorry , but i could n't even try it
5	a true fushia which is really hard to find very nice formular coverage is good and the color is wow !
4	i do n't use makeup that often but when i do this completed my look soft but smooth to apply and you only need a little bit to give your skin that extra glow to just make you feel sexy and ready for a night out !
5	another beautiful make up product from jane iredale
2	this product contains sulfates and i did not want a product that contained these chemicals water eau aqua , sodium laureth sulfate , ammonium lauryl sulfate , cocamidopropyl betaine , , pca dimethicone , cetyl alcohol , glycol distearate , peg 15 copolymer , , hydrogenated propylene , peg 150 distearate , polyquaternium 7 dimethiconol , 6 , peg 8 dimethicone , silicone 2 , panthenol succinate , cetyl dimethicone peg 8 succinate , ethyl ester , 7
2	the exfoliating quality of baxter of california night cream aha comes from this lotion 's glycolic acid base , which is a very mild alpha hydroxyl formulation after several weeks of use , i saw no redness as i 've experienced with other exfoliants but neither did i see any real change in my skin i like the feel of it non oily , dry , almost talc y dense , yet easily spreadable and a dab covers quite a bit of territory but after 30 minutes , my skin feels no different than before night cream aha is not entirely odorless for me it 's got an elusive nearly chemical fragrance i'm grateful it 's not spicy , floral , herb like , or overly medicinal , and i'm also grateful it 's not long lasting my spouse said , it feels nice , non greasy , and but something about baxter 's night cream aha is bothering my eyes , causing unusual dryness and minor stinging this happens even though i apply the product far , far from my eyes and even if i just put it on the back of my hand so i started looking into the list of ingredients , which i included below some compounds such as certain fatty alcohols may be derived from animals or plants boc makes no claim that the night cream aha is vegan , so there is no reason to expect that it is other ingredients like hydrogenated polyisobutene have used animals in testing \( and yes , there were \) still others sorbitan stearate , glyceryl stearate , and cetyl alcohol have been considered toxic and environmentally dangerous in canada then there are the four \( four \) parabens , i e preservatives , recently associated with breast tumors granted , parabens have not been found to cause cancer , and they can exist naturally in some foods \( grapes , \) and even show up in some otc pain but has seen fit to butylparaben from certain child oriented products the fact that boc chooses to use four parabens is worrisome this ingredient list , along with no visible results except for the dry , stinging eyes , makes me happier to just do without boc right now it was a nice to have that was nice to try , but ultimately it might not be so nice to earth and animals humans included ingredients water \( aqua \) , c12 15 alkyl benzoate , hydrogenated polyisobutene , cetyl alcohol , sorbitan stearate , glyceryl stearate , glycerin , ethylhexyl palmitate , glycolic acid , peg 100 stearate , ascorbyl palmitate , benzophenone 3 , butylene glycol , dimethicone , , disodium edta , panthenol , propylene glycol , sodium pca , sodium hyaluronate , sodium hydroxide , stearic acid , officinale leaf extract , wheat amino acids , butylparaben , ethylparaben , methylparaben , phenoxyethanol , propylparaben , fragrance \( parfum \) , blue 1 \( ci 42090 \) , yellow 5 \( ci 19140 \)
5	this is the most extraordinary hair product i 've come across in a long time i first used it on wet hair and then blow dried and gave me a very smooth blowout i used a few drops afterwards and it made my hair gleam and then i read the reviews , a number of which said to try it on dry hair so that 's what i did i used two pumps in the morning and it made my hair look really greasy so i was all set to wear my hair in an updo that day but after i put on my makeup , which took about 20 minutes , my hair looked absolutely gorgeous ! it was soft and shiny and the ends were did n't look dry at all i proceeded to use the curling iron , as i usually do \( the oil has heat protection up to 500 degrees \) and my hair had body and bounce and looked fantastic ! so the next morning i did the same thing but used three pumps and i got the same great results i 've done this every day for a month and it 's like i have a different head of hair my hair is heavily highlighted so breakage and dryness are always issues but the keratin in this oil has made my hair so much stronger that i no longer have any breakage at all and dryness is a thing of the past before , my ends looked like straw and now they are supple and lay nice and flat and smooth when i first apply the oil , my hair does look greasy , but that goes away in about 15 20 minutes my hair absorbs the oil and looks and feels like virgin hair it 's the most amazing thing ! if your hair is dry and damaged , this treatment will restore it and make it healthy looking again and you can use it daily without making it greasy or weighing it down i use 3 to 4 pumps and distribute the oil to the last 3 or 4 inches , concentrating on the ends and i no longer have to worry about heat styling because this oil is an excellent heat protectant it can be used over styling products or hairspray too i 've tried other oils , like argan , and they only sit on top and do n't really soak in and end up making my hair an oily mess and weighing it down this oil soaks in completely and definitely does n't weigh it down and is very lightweight it also smells amazing i do n't know what oils are in this potion because the print on the bottle is too tiny to read , but whatever they are , they are amazing ! ! i will use this oil forever and will tell everyone i know how awesome it is you can try this oil on damp hair but if you do n't get the expected awesome results , try it on dry hair in the last month my hair has gone from and fried to nourished , supple and shiny it 's an amazing transformation i highly recommend this awesome oil there 's simply nothing in the world like it
5	i love this brand i love the rich pigment this color is really a lovely shade for spring i think arrived well packaged it really does stay all day on me , but i love that it lasts a long time i like all of the stila bright all day lipsticks
5	this is my new favorite toothpaste i suffer from dry mouth from medication normal toothpaste makes my mouth so dry and dry mouth toothpaste tastes horrible i love the way ginger mint tastes and i love the way it makes my mouth feel i also got cinnamon mint but i definitely like this one better !
5	this color is soooooi nice ! i get always compliments every time i have it on my nails i keep buying it , this is my 4 bottle !
5	pca is a wonderful skin care line for any skin type my daughter is 22 , and loves this product i'm 53 , and love this ! minimizes pores , evens skin out
5	tiny sample , but it feels and smells great
5	this cnd shellac is very durable and stays on without chipping until my nails grow out and i have to remove it myself
5	does not sting eyes quite mild no scent the consistency is kind of like thin toothpaste , and it easily it does not foam or feel frothy , but it cleaned our infant nicely the other alternative , which we use a lot \( but not on the face \) is dove unscented bars
2	honestly , i really do n't see any effect after using it for a month does it really thickens the hair diameter or just temporarily coats the hair with gel to make it appear thick \? does it really nourish the hair \? not sure how long you need to use it to see results
4	full coverage but not masky i got the color 6 for my light medium toned skin and its a bit too light 7 might have been a better match esp in summer easy to spread over sunscreen you really need to use a good sunscreen under it \( i use bioderma laser \) since this wo n't be applied thickly enough to give adequate uv protection i only need about 5 tiny dots on my face then blend well with fingers it helps to warm the tube in my pocket before applying so that the product out better no powder needed and i apply the tiniest dots under eyes and sides of nose as concealer the only problem i have with it is the cyclopentasiloxane which is a known acne trigger for me , but so far so good as long as i cleanse it off well
5	use with obagi serum c 10 for sensitive skin types wonderful product for really dry sensitive skin that flakes and cracks does a good job with rosacea too ! no pain !
5	i love the palette so much ! the colors are beautiful neutrals earth tones they are very creamy in texture soft , easy to apply and blend beautifully they are very pigmented i prefer this over my urban decay naked basics palette this has more colors and is all matte my favorite color is the fire color which is a beautiful rust color the black color makes for a great eyeliner and is very dark black the looks you can create with this are endless !
4	i agree with other reviewer it 's not as bright as i had pictured this to be still i will wear once i get a tan i think the color will stand out more mine looks on the peach side some say pink but i did n't see that
5	i absolutely love this product ! place it in your fridge for a better awake cooling feeling i will definitely order again ! !
4	this is a true bronze color , not too much red , making it suitable for dusting all over my face i have light olive skin and with light application , it provides a hint of color with good there is a bit of shimmer , but not overly so i 've dusted this on my neck and decolletage with good results recommended
5	great product !
5	being an older lady i was concerned about this highlighter showing too much when it comes to the and , or what they 're really called wrinkles , on my face well , that is not the case if applied with just a light dusting ! i'm happy to report that this vincent longo cosmetic product called la bella \( beautiful light or glow \) is fabulous ! i applied a very light dusting with one of my brushes , first on my cheeks , then all over my face to get the whole effect this was put on over my liquid makeup and powder blush and the look was perfection ! i swear , i looked younger with a lovely youthful glow ! the highlighter \( color patina \) is more of a beige tan color , and i'm very fair , but it is exactly the perfect shade it went on smoothly and evenly and stayed all day i'm very pleased with this new addition to my collection of cosmetics
5	10 stars ! this eau de toilette is just lovely ! the manufacturer says has wild roses and ambergris with notes of citrusy bergamot , vanilla and earthy patchouli what i smell on me is a powdery , and somewhat musky floral , which is nice , because i think that is a not too sweet and clean scent the patchouli and vanilla give this a very scent i love a bit of spiciness that you would get from , , but i do not smell that i smell exotic powder interesting how a blend of scents add up to a clean scent it is long lasting , because i could smell it on me today from yesterday i just spray a bit and it is enough a half a spray i love how it is subtle it comes in a gift box with a baby blue ribbon handle and baby blue tissue inside which means it is a perfect gift ! this is a class act i highly highly recommend this
4	i have been using this for almost a year and i love the smell and my hair feels amazing i usually use this product before i blow dry my hair and my hair smells amazing for a few days it does n't get messy and it makes my hair less frizzy too
4	this cream doesnt leave my skin with a greasy feeling the cream is nice and thick , but spreads very easily on the skin it absorbs into my skin very nicely the smell is nice and light , no heavy smell that would bother me during the day it has definitely helped during these cold winter months , when my skin generally gets very dry and i need extra creams to help keep it moisturized i have been only using this cream for the last few weeks and have had no problem !
2	initially when i put this on , i did feel some stinging , but has since subsided this item came with no directions on how long to use this product for , but for the past few week i 've been using it , i 've seen no results
5	my wife tried this out and was blown away by the quality of a brand that had been completely unknown to her we received king 's canyon , which is a vibrant red color that my wife and i both like her thoughts it 's 5 free this is always nice to see , but somewhat hard to find application is amazingly smooth and uniform , even though the applicator is n't as wide as opi 's additional strokes do n't mess up the finish touch ups are easy to apply and look great while we had never heard of uslu airlines before , now she ca n't wait to try more colors from this brand we ca n't think of a single bad thing to say \( the price is incredibly fair for the quality you get \) , so five stars !
1	i bought 2 of these and i'm very disappointed these cost the full price of an essie polish so i expected it to be authentic these are watered down fakes i wish amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff \(
5	lone it thank you
4	this is a little lighter than i expected it also goes on differently than other pencils it really does require the brushing out using the other end i feel like it is a little more effort than i want to do for my brows it is pretty and i will likely use it for special occasions when i want to have that extra polish that said , day to day it is a multi step process and i'm too in my life to add another one of those i would like it better if it were a tad darker and if the pencil end worked well without the brush part
2	it 's too light a color for me
5	my hubby tried this out and i really like it it 's not overly strong and not sweet a light manly scent i would buy this again for him
5	love it came fast to will buy more
2	this stuff gave me a terrible rash on my chest definitely not for use if you have sensitive skin i started out using it every day then went to once every other day rash did n't start to clear up until i stopped use altogether
5	excellent product worth the experience
5	been using this product for years
5	this crabtree evelyn product lives up to the brand 's high standard , with premium scent and feel commensurate with the high price it 's packaged attractively as well , in a metallic feeling tube with a high quality screw top within a cardboard outer box attractive enough to give as a gift the product inside the tube is white and rich feeling , adding a lot of moisture without an oily feeling a little dab goes a long way its scent is citrus without much of an afternote , smelling nice when it goes on but fading fairly quickly as it should when applied thinly , the product disappears into the skin in seconds , leaving it feeling soft and pleasant for several hours afterward it 's a really nice cream for hands or faces do note that it 's so rich feeling because it 's based on macadamia nut oil , which might be an allergy problem \( i actually checked it with a friend with a nut allergy and found the product did n't a reaction from contact , but it 's probably best to be cautious \) apart from that , it 's highly recommended
5	wife says really good product easy in the application and requires an occasional re touching i do not have sensitive skin but products that are low quality tend to break out my skin it 's not the case with the dermablend powder i apply it with a kabuki brush , set it with mac spray face mist , which helps it set on my skin beautifully
5	great color natural and fresh
1	i ordered this hoping it would improve the the toppik application process and the end result simply stated , it did not i apply toppik every morning to my 12 year old daughter 's head \( she suffers from \) if i am unable to use this device to apply toppik to my daughter 's head i doubt very much that one could use it to apply toppik to one 's own self
4	shade 06 is a violet plum deeper shade with a light mauve or light lavender pale shade it is more heavily pigmented that typical drug store shades , but i have been spoiled by my urban decay naked 2 palette , which contains eye shadow that has a consistency and pigmentation that is about as perfect as it gets ! the japonesque shadow is not as good as the urban decay but it is nice i think either a primer or \( in my case \) a lighter shade of cream eye shadow underneath is essential for shadow like this put on alone , it will tend to fall off your lid , and you wo n't get the full benefit of it or its full color the case is very nice sturdy , elegant , well made it is not going to break when you 're halfway done with the shadow my pet peeve ! overall , this is a very nice shadow , just falls a bit short of urban decay or mac as far as the texture and pigmentation consistency but a little still goes a long way , so the darker color specifically will last a long time
2	does nothing it says to do very watered down and very over priced i feel lucky me i got ripped off !
1	this is a very thin , clear oil it is n't as thick as baby oil and runs almost like water i would never put oil or an oil based product on my skin because it clogs the pores some people might be able to get away with it , but even though i have dry skin , my skin will break out if i put oil on it , so i have skipped that test i did rub it into my hands and it dries fast without leaving an oily slick what i did use this for is my hair , which is very thick and very dry after shampooing , i poured a little bit of the oil into my hand and rubbed my hands together then i ran my hands through my hair , keeping the oil away from the scalp area afterwards , i blew my hair dry then applied more oil usually , i apply a gel in the same manner that calms the frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine to it however , the oil did not produce the same results my hair still had flyaway ends with no gloss to it my newly washed and dried hair always looks better the next morning after the hair product has had a chance to calm the frizzy hair , but the morning after i used the oil , the results were no different than the night before ill stick to my gel product to end the frizziness of dry hair
5	nice color , not my favorite i use this with other shellac colors , as mentioned on youtube \( nail art \) my mother wears this color alone i do wear this color with white tips like a french styling as all shellac products , it lasts at least two weeks ! love shellac products ! !
4	good coverage blends well
4	ok i'm gonna tell it like it is i think jack black is a good line , but not a great line , and is overpriced in general my personal skin care regimen 1 billy jealousy shave cream cheaper than jack black and in my opinion better 2 billy jealousy shaved ice after shave healer the jack black is pretty good too , but i like the billy jealousy better 3 jack black facial moisturizer i do like this product a lot 4 i used the protein booster skin serum saw no real difference , and for as much as it costs , you could find better options 5 i do like the jack black eye serum in general , jack black is considered more of an anti aging line , hence the higher price point i am not saying their products are bad in any way , i just think there are better products out there for the money one line i'm going to look into is the menscience line of products but , you really ca n't beat the billy jealousy shave cream i have super sensitive skin , and never see any red inflamed skin when using this shave cream
3	nice smelling product i do n't think it is worth the price
3	good ingredients and unscented , but did n't absorb well into my skin ended up giving this to a friend
4	this is the 2nd room spray that i purchased in the last week , only because the first one was defective this time i bought the antica rose , orris , and which works well and smells very nice it 's a warm floral and not too sweet also it is n't overpowering or strong and i would like it even more if it lasted longer than it does i do spray it more than i should just to be able to smell it in the rooms and for this reason this bottle wo n't last long for me it says that it can be used for linens but i am reluctant to spray it on my sheets for fear it might get them stained from the ingredients like any other room spray there are many different fragrances antica has to choose from depending on preference and at this price i would recommend giving it a try the first one i ordered was the lavender and lime and because it did n't work properly i did n't comment on it favorably i did say it smelled nice though ! i have one last remark about this spray when i press the top down to spray not a lot goes into the air and i have to do it quite a few times to get enough into the room unlike some other ones that i 've used \( diptyque which costs more than double the price of these \)
5	polish is blue , not bright , not dark , just blue i have two other blues and should have just stuck with what i already had not different enough to buy again , though i will happily use the product
5	im so glad to find this ! it covers my spots of thin hair by shading the scalp give it a try
4	as i love most things french , or made in france , i do think they make superior , quality products on the whole , i was very happy to be offered this vichy purete thermale perfecting toner through amazon 's vine program i was not familiar with the vichy line of products the bottle did not come sealed , but it does have a flip cap which has a soothing color , as does the appearance of the toner bottle after cleansing my skin , i a little of the toner onto a cotton pad and wiped it over my face i liked the feeling so much that i did it twice the toner just leaves your skin feeling very refreshed i like that this toner has no alcohol , which can be too drying to the skin it is also suitable for sensitive skin , which i also have it has no parabens and is only lightly scented with a nice refreshing scent if you really want your skin to feel refreshed , you might want to keep your toner in your refrigerator i especially do that in warmer weather it wakes my skin up in a good way ! i will be keeping my eyes open for other vichy products
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	i bought this particular one for my mom but i had use it for a year now and this is the best oil i have ever try so far , i use around 3 pumps in my hair and then blow dry , you will love the results
5	i am a fan of all the jack black products have been using them for years as they provide good skin and hair products for men without a girly scent \( you can buy most of his line at nordstroms or \) but i have never tried the pads \( i thought that was very masculine \) turns out i was wrong to be afraid of the resurfacing pads the pads are slightly abrasive so they help with the removal of dead skin one great side effect is your skin feels very fresh after using did not notice any difference using a week for 3 weeks than on the fourth week a friend i had not seen in awhile mentioned that my face looked younger what a nice compliment \( i am 42 and my faces is starting to give away my age \) this product is super easy to use and you will see results you just have to give it some time and use the product as recommended
5	i love this stuff i use it at least twice a day and it has made a wonderful difference in my dry , aging lips will continue to purchase !
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	wow ! i 've tried several skincare lines and received training is so many \( i work in field \) i am very positively surprised how good ingredients are and how good my skin looks and feel after using it basically if you apply moisturizer and 30 minutes later your skin feels dry it means it was mostly water invest in a good skincare skin the largest organ we have , are 90 of the picture and skin will represent you for a long time i use it am and pm , it 's just great , not too heavy , a little goes long way now i'm curious about the whole line have a healthy skin ! \)
4	this is really easy to apply , and seems to perk up my eyes before my makeup goes on i like the way that it feels but i would n't say it will leave permanent results this is a great temporary fix for dark circles , and can help to make your face look brighter and more refreshed i absolutely plan to continue using this as part of my daily beauty regime it will last about 2 months of daily use before i will need to buy more there is almost no scent to the product which is really nice
5	skin left feeling very clean , not drying at all
4	pretty color !
5	love this stuff !
5	excellent
3	calvin klein 's eternity now for men deodorant body spray sounded like it would be a nice , spicy , warm fragrance that would be lighter than the cologne it does have a lighter scent than a cologne would , but i cannot say that i appreciate it upon application , it smells strongly of citrus y ginger , with a hint of vanilla and woods it dries down on my skin to a synthetic citrus ginger artificial smell that i do not care for on fabric , it smells slightly better , but still synthetic in the air \( as overspray \) it smells fairly nice , if a little strong for an air freshener fine if you do not mind synthetic fragrances , but for the price i expected better
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	wife reports that this serum did make her skin feel smoother and softer , but did n't really do anything for her deep wrinkles however , she does believe there is more elasticity with her very fine wrinkles the scent is pleasant without smelling like harsh chemicals , which is always a plus when dealing with anti wrinkle serums
5	i'm a 50 year old woman who is experiencing hair thinning in some areas on my scalp i could n't make a part before i used toppik , it blends into your scalp and nobody knows that it 's on i highly recommend this i tried the travel size first and was hooked try it you wo n't be sorry
5	my favorite eyeliner never smudges i like the plum color not garish at all , a very subtle effect a nice change from basic black
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	i never liked the dark colors on my nail , but this one changed my whole idea of nail colors i originally intended to use this under iced coral for mixed tone effects but i 'll definately enjoy this as it is alone i ca n't wait for the fall
1	this color is similar to a bubble gum sparkle pink it looked like it would be a creamy beige to me or at least i hoped it would be looking for a nice neutral shade it was anything but this one will be tossed
4	been using for a week skin is soft love that it has of 50 i live in florida and want one product with moisturizer and combined there is no detectable scent with this product the packaging is clean and there 's an easy to dispense top nozzle one pump is enough for my entire face this will last a long long time my skin is soft , clean and has not broken out using this
2	i love opi nail polish and think it is worth every penny unfortunately , this lacquer remove works no better than the dollar store polish remover i was very disappointed
5	this stuff works amazing for acne once you get one apply it i do it a few times and it dries them out quickly
5	i 've used this product for several years i 've tried other retinol products , but always come back to skin medica i think it 's a great product and i would recommend it to anyone who wants a great retinol cream
5	came fast and is really pretty
5	gorgeous color
5	i had terrible acne ! i tried everything proactive , murad , and clinique ! nothing worked i actually started using this through my dermatologist it was so expensive so i searched for it on amazon , lucky for me , it popped right up ! i love it i use it in the and at night with my clarisonic \( you can also use the olay pro x 29 00 \) brushes help to ensure you get all dirt and makeup out of your skin this is the main culprit of acne !
5	i am always unsure about ordering retinol i have extremely sensitive skin this cream did not bother me at all ! it takes just a small amount dabbed around the eyes i use it only at night it is impossible to say if it will be effective without more time i like the way it feels after i rub it in no fragrances , either ! tube is small but should last quite awhile i'm hoping to get rid of some milia and dark spots around my eyes retinol is supposed to be good for that
5	this is another great product from l'occitane it just sinks into my skin and makes it look better i had not been treating my skin very well recently and it was beginning to show it truly does feel like it is just melting in it does n't look or feel oily at all i thought it might be heavy , but it is n't my skin feels very soft and silky i used it before i put on the l'occitane cream moisturizer , a great combination
5	been using pevonia products for 20 years any time a try something else , for say savings or convenience , i regret it and return to the best match for my skin natural ingredients makes a difference
3	well , have n't been able to use it because mine came without a cleansing pad wondering how to remedy this !
5	love the color
5	i 've recently switched over to mario badescu everything for my skin care regime and every single thing works i 've tried forever to get rid of my adult acne so i'm glad i finally found something i live in the desert so it 's difficult to find something that does n't dry my skin but this surprisingly does n't dry it out i use it twice a week and follow with the healing mask to keep my skin from drying too much
3	i 've used liftlab lift for a week , and i do n't see any difference in my skin that said , i might not be a good judge of this product because i never see any difference in my skin no matter what i 've used someday , i 'll just have to learn to accept aging i gave this a 3 star review because it smells good and appears to be a good moisturizer
5	i use this after my shower and before a light lotion on my face before i put on makeup it 's quick to use and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean love it and would recommend to anyone
3	i chose this item to cover my heart surgery scar it hides the color but looks weird it may be useful to cover that are smooth but with anything raised it is only mediocre
3	i find dermablend products to be hit or miss some are incredible and a fair value , while others are just pricey and miss the mark the chocolate brown shade is a rich pigment , a little darker than i would expect you can go very light with it , but because it is so rich you end up blending longer my main knock is dermablend markets their expensive cover cr egrave mes as lasting up to 16 hours yes , if you let it dry and then cover with setting powder i could make the same statement about numerous , far less expensive brands it last for hours if you cover it with our equally expensive setting powder so , it 's ok , but pricey for what it is
5	all vinylux products last long , are chip free and dry super fast and hard in 4 minutes ! ! the top coat is the key i keep a bottle with me to apply when i do lots of house work , or cooking a wonderful new product ! !
5	best pressed powder for over 50 ! love it been using it forever
5	love these color combinations and it lasts all day !
5	as a retired skin care professional i'm very picky about the quality of the products i use to say the least \( ! \) i am very happy with the results of these serums and i feel that they do as they promise facial serum can have a variety of from thick to thin , these serums are on the thinner side in texture that does n't impact the effectiveness but some care must be taken in application to avoid wasting product this set is ideal for test driving the serums and finding the one \( s \) you like best i like the lifting smoothing serums the best myself one of the lovely things about using serums is that they can be used around the eyes as long as there are no irritating ingredients these serums caused no eye irritation for me whatsoever fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable with a definite softening in texture of the skin my own skin has taken on a subtle , yet perceivable glow i'm using these serums under my moisturizer however i still feel a difference using them alone all serums can feel a bit sticky due to the concentration of ingredients and that problem can be alleviated with using some moisturizer on top my makeup application looks smoother and more refined except for one foundation that i wear that is my long wearing brand it causes the product to pill somewhat but it does that with pretty much any serum so that 's no surprise these serums play well with lighter foundations , in my case a tinted moisturizer or cc cream i have exceptionally dry skin due to a health condition so i feel that 's the main with me and the products i use note that effectiveness can be greatly impacted by skin that needs exfoliation if you have trouble with absorption , you most likely need to get rid of excess dead skin so that the product can get through and do it 's work i feel that these serums are the ideal for users of the nuface devices while the containers are small , not much is needed for application there are no fragrances to struggle with here , either they are gentle \( non irritating \) yet effective if you 're not quite sure what to do with serums there 's plenty of info online to guide you for your skin type i'm impressed with the results so far and highly recommend them
5	i have been using the products from this brand for some time , and i have used the eye cream in the past with great results what i love about this cleansing foam is that the pump dispenser dispenses easily , it dispenses the exact amount that i need to wash my face and no more and no less , it dispenses the liquid in a foam so it rinses easily away and cleanses evenly without getting too much or too little on some places of my face , and it is a highly effective cleanser that strikes just the right balance between cleansing and moisturizing i usually use the lush brand of facial cleansers , but i find them a little difficult to use because you need to take a pea sized bit out of the tub , mix it with water , and then spread over your face and hope that you do n't get a clump stuck near your hairline or on a dry part of your cheek while i have tried other brands of facial cleanser in the past , i have found that most cleansers strip my skin and leave it feeling itchy , or worse , leave a residue that makes me break out i was surprised to find that this cleansing foam was 100 on par with the quality and results i usually get from using the lush brand , yet it was so much more pleasant and easy to use i would definitely recommend this cleansing foam , and now that i have tried it , i foresee myself using it regularly and purchasing it once this testing sample runs out
3	this stuff is ok but not as good as the regular super hold pomade it gives you that icky feeling by the end of the day i also find that it does not wash out as easily as the pomade , especially not just with water the shine is a little less and it is more matte feeling than the pomade but honestly not a huge difference same vanilla scent which is nice if you absolutely want low shine matte , this stuff is ok otherwise i 'd opt for the regular layrite super hold
5	wow love cnd polish this is a pretty punch like pink great color for all seasons cnd polish lasts 2 weeks plus without chipping cnd is amazing super fast shipping
5	this is nice smelling hair oil that is pretty much like every other good quality hair oil the smell lasts for about 2 hours and it 's easy to over apply this stuff really fast delivery from this seller though
5	love
3	i'm not sure what is wrong with this color , but it goes on really uneven and is very thin compared to the other essie colors i use
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
2	the color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats who 's got time for that
5	from the name of this product , i thought the highlights would be pearly white but it turns out that it is a beautiful gold sparkle i have olive complexion and the gold goes fantastic with my skin tone it really dresses up my eye makeup and makes my eyes shine i plan on wearing this as my top coat shadow for the upcoming holiday season parties it is n't something that i would wear every day in my lifestyle but it is certainly something that i would wear when i want to really dress up
5	i 've been using a prescription strength retin a cream for about eight years , and generally have pretty good skin at the age of 42 , though , i 've been plagued by acne outbreaks that have been leaving deep red marks on my face that do n't easily fade after doing some research , i had heard that glycolic acid peels can help fade acne scars , so i ordered this one based on the positive reviews and it really is fantastic ! i waited to use this for two weeks before writing a review , but even in that short amount of time , it has already made a huge difference in my skin , which appears brighter and feels smoother i 've also noticed a pretty dramatic difference in my fine lines and wrinkles , especially around the eye area my red acne marks are also slowly fading , and i'm not getting as many breakouts as i had been i 've been alternating this with my retin a cream at night , and use one pad on my face , neck , chest , and the back of my hands my sensitive skin tingles a bit after using this , but it 's not too bad and the tingling goes away after a few minutes the other products that may also be helping are the vitamin c serum and antioxidant serum from paula 's choice that i 've also been using i 've been using the paula 's choice products for about three months , though , and it was really adding in this glycolix product that things up a bit it 's pricey , but i'm honestly just amazed at the difference this has made in such a short amount of time !
5	great price arrived on time love this stuff
5	love this stuff smells so fresh , and clean moisturizers with just a little bit not oily , and it soaks right in love the orange scent easy to use
4	so this is basically a gentle power sander for your feet i do n't have many callouses on mine , but the two prominent ones i 've had since i was a kid this did a nice job of smoothing them out , and was n't uncomfortable at all the directions say to not apply pressure for more than 2 3 seconds at a time , but they 're being cautious if you have thicker callouses , you can sand away with a bit more i liked the two heads , the blue being the sander and the purple being the \( just a little finer grain \) it says to use the latter after the other , but you can also use that one for other parts of your feet that might just be a little rough my only gripe is that cleaning the heads is kind of a pain with the useless brush they provide a old toothbrush works much better it says you probably wo n't have to buy replacement heads for a year with normal use , which makes this a definite value but i could see how , if you do n't clean the heads well enough , the build up of residue will make the sander less effective and make the job take twice as long
5	this serum is more like a thin cream than a watery serum when i first opened the bottle , i had to pump it around 50 times to get it out of the container , i thought for a moment the pump was defective it has a pleasant scent and dries almost immediately this contains the form of vitamin c which is called tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate , which is a fat soluble , stable form of c some researchers believe this form of vitamin c has a greater for skin because its fatty acid component aids penetration and protect the vitamin from rapid oxidation this form of vitamin c has also been shown to stimulate healthy collagen production and reduce wrinkle depth so give this some time maybe 60 days or so to see any improvements improvements do n't happen overnight i love the glow this gives off and i use a little of it on top of my moisturizer also i rarely use foundation and this is all i need the glow does n't fade away either
5	i wanted my husband to try a new way to style his hair but we 're totally lost in the realm of what seems like endless varieties of pomade i'm glad i got this one it leaves his hair soft and not sticky , yet keeps the style nicely i will keep purchasing
4	it works to help keep your skin moist and after about 10 days i did notice a lightening of the dark spots on my hands and face but not dramatically my skin was softer where i applied it especially around my neckline and shoulders where much of the sun damage i had was concentrated perhaps with prolonged use , i will see more and more fading of the sun spots or liver spots as some want to call them made from plant oil and natural ingredients but it is niacin based and those who are niacin sensitive should take caution
3	there are some thinks i really like about the art of shaving kit , but there are also some things i really do n't care for i do like the pre shave oil stepping out of the shower , i rub the pre shave oil on my face , let it soak in for about a minute or so , then i add the shaving cream the oil seems to provide a great base for the shaving cream , and it provides a much smoother shave i like the shaving cream provided in the kit as well , but i will say it takes a few applications to get it right the first time i tried it , i used too much , and the excess shave lotion combined with the oil had the consistency of toothpaste , and it up my razor that was my fault though , not something i blame on the product i'm used to shaving with canned lotion , this lotion is much thicker and it will take a few times to get the application down the after shave lotion is okay , but i still prefer my standard old spice after shave maybe it 's because of the thicker shaving lotion , or the pre shave oil , but when i use the art of shaving after shave , my face feels oily i feel like i have to rub down with a towel after using it the brush is kind of useless , i tried using it several times , but it never did as good a job as just spreading the lotion around with my hand the final thing is the overall scent i'm not a big fan of lavender i would prefer something a little more masculine or at least a bit more traditional the lavender scent is kind of cloying , and after using three separate lotions and oils , you will smell like lavender regardless of whatever else you may try to cover it with
5	i never thought i 'd actually an expensive grooming set in my life i 've always been content with cheap drugstore grooming kit , but this just blew my mind this is german engineering at its finest the case was well made every item in the kit fit into a neat , well thought out custom slots the nail clipper is something out of this world it looks like it was designed by and it was a pleasure to clip my nails and not an annoying chore i have to do i ca n't even look at my old nail clipper any more there were no sharp edges left nor did it feel like it would tear at my nails i'm familiar with zwilling i have two of their kitchen knives and they are the workhorse in the kitchen they feel just right and are used all the time this grooming set is one of these things i'm myself for not getting earlier in my life everything feels like it was made out of high quality metal and designed by who have thought out every use of these now the price is a lot of money to spend on a kit this is most definitely a luxury item i 'd have a hard time this as a purchase to myself , but would gladly gift it to someone as an amazing gift that i hope they 'd never lose but considering the cost of zwilling 's , i would consider it an investment 4 5 stars
3	to me , this smells like old lady perfume the bottle is amazing , with a cut glass look and a satin ribbon the actual perfume volume is only 1 7 oz , so this is also a great deal of extra packaging i am not a perfume expert , but this one did not suit me
4	my only issue with this product is that it moves around easily until it dries i do not prefer this format on my face as it is tricky to get full coverage i like this stick coverage better on my body blemishes
5	i love this product great eye product
2	the polish i received looks nothing like the one shown for sale it looks more similar to essie 's play date this was also the first time i 've purchased nail polish online lesson learned stick to purchasing polish in person
5	feels really nice over your skin specially on a hot day 3 4 oz bottle tones and refreshes you skin with a fine mist no weird order or smell to it does not feel sticky really does make my skin feel refreshed would definitely use this one in the summer when i want to cool off
4	the facial spray by mario badescu smells wonderful \( if you like roses \) there is so much product in this , it 's cheap , and the ingredients are great i have been using this in the morning as a toner , it makes my pores feel tighter , and i 've been using it as a setting spray for my makeup definitely recommend
3	good
5	with all the complaints in these reviews about how difficult and messy application is , i expected the worst what i found , instead , was completely fine ! but let me start with the results i'm an extreme skeptic about eye treatments in general , because i think they cost a lot for results i do n't really see i genuinely was not expecting much from this one either , but when i took off the tissue , the results were dramatic i have olive skin and am prone to puffiness and darkness around my eyes this eye treatment made the area around my eyes dramatically better i took before and after pictures just to be sure i was n't imagining it the effect seems to last for at least a few hours now in terms of the application , it seems to me that the product designers had this challenge of how to put the serum that they know works under the eyes for a period of time tissue paper itself would probably disintegrate while a sponge material would n't stay in place on your face they came up with what feels a bit like rice paper when you see it in the package , it looks much sturdier and more sponge like than it is i accidentally off a piece of one because i did n't realize how fragile it was but it really is the perfect for the liquid i do n't see how it is hard to apply , like others have said you just pour a bit on to saturate and then put it under your eyes and that 's where you can see the application really works when you put it on your face , it looks like how you 'd imagine putting a wet tissue on your face would look it holds to your face completely is it a liquid \? yes , so you need to pour it while standing over a sink , but that 's not a big deal and you want to be careful not to pour too much over just the first pad but they give you plenty for both eyes in a vial and with practice , i imagine being able to conserve enough for two applications per vial but of course , i would n't have enough of those cool rice paper pads the serum has no smell and is not sticky it has the consistency of water the price , of course , is the downside it 's about 12 treatment but for events , or for days where you wake up looking awful , yes this stuff is worth it
1	i bought this product \( in another color \) , followed the directions exactly , but this does nothing but cause your existing hair to turn an off share and feel like straw unlike the toppik fibers , this does n't do anything for areas of thinning i contacted the company and asked for a refund , but did n't even get the of a response toppik fibers are good , but this product is useless
5	great color ! very soft and gentle
5	i'm usually not a huge fan of pink polish , but this one is really pretty very pale , chalky pink the spring line seems pretty thin , but i got good coverage with 2 coats also tried with a layer of as a final coat before top coat and was very pretty
3	personally , i was n't a fan of this perfume it was kind of flowery and reminded me of cheap perfume you 'd pick up at a discount store my daughter who is 16 , however , immediately disappeared with it and seems to like it she also loved the bottle and , i agree , it 's very pretty and unique so , in my house there 's one thumbs up and one thumbs down
5	i would reccomend this product to anyone trying to take care of aging skin i have used this for several years now each 50 ml lasts well over six months i use it nightly
5	i love the cnd gel polishes this is a great color application is smooth and lasts at least 2 weeks delivery was on schedule
4	made a great gift for a friends birthday ! the color is beautiful ! i would highly reccommend this product to anyone
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	nuface mini so far so good if this replaces actual spa visits , it will be well worth the money i can tell a little bit of difference , but her friends can see it even more than i do she likes the fact that she can do this at home without spending the time in town at the spa i like that it will be a cheaper alternative over the long run it is easy to use and she thinks it will be a good investment for her skin care plan
4	i have used other xen tan products and i had much better results this is a two person review though hence the four stars my skin is usually medium color and now that summer is behind us my tan has faded and its fair when i applied it was hard to get the streaks out but with the glove i had it did happen my legs did have color , but with my skin tone it was more of a orange tan not horrible but not a desired look i gave to my sister in law to try and she loved it ! she has a dark skin tone though and as a brunette and a base tan from the summer still the color looked really good so i would say this is a great weekly self tanner if you do n't have a fair skin tone the glove is a life saver with these types of products , i would highly suggest purchasing as well
4	used this on an unsightly pimple near my hairline it did n't dry my skin and was easy to use under makeup i 've found that to be true of other salicylic treatments what i liked about this was the precision of the applicator i appreciated that it 's non porous aluminum and can be wiped clean with a tissue or cotton ball when i'm done
4	i like the crabtree evelyn avocado lotion it smells great and the compact tube is perfect to take along on the go i use it when i'm out and about to get that extra dose of moisture , it definitely does the trick at home i need the industrial strength moisturizing so i still go to my super heavy duty tube of which is very thick , comes in a big tub , does n't smell all that great and is not portable the crabtree evelyn lotion goes on thin and starts off a bit greasy as all lotions seem to do a few minutes later it 's dried and soaked into the skin so the greasy feeling is gone but the pleasant scent is still nicely set in i would recommend the lotion to anyone fighting the winter as a great travel or handy in the purse go to cream
5	excellent product , it takes just a small amount to cover my thinning area
2	i wanted to love this product ! i love olive oil and the thought of using a natural product opposed to other make up removers with additives really this product to be something greater in my mind than it actually was first off the packaging is horrendous you receive this tiny package which can mistakenly be thrown away the wand is not removable replaceable which is pretty disgusting to say the least the other applicators cannot be continuously re used and are the equivalent of cheap cotton swabs the actual olive oil that you receive is such a small amount compared to the excessive price , and it has additives it is not completely natural the actual product can correct smudges from my liquid eyeliner but i can also do that with my make up remover and cotton swabs that are disposable ! this is nothing special if necessary you can bring it with you to keep in your purse but not at this price it is just too expensive for what it actually is i found that it would also leave a shiny sticky film which would need to be dried and cleaned if i wanted to reapply my liner do not recommend for use in your bathroom your current product is doing the same thing i do not see how re using a dirty wand would be all right not worth it look elsewhere
5	awesome color !
5	really mild but effective weve always liked mustela products and have used the frequently this has been around for years and im glad that it is becoming more easily available in the american market all of their products are simply safe for babies sensitive skin and this one included my ten year old daughter currently uses it to wash her face , i wanted her to use a product that is not too harsh to her young skin this is also very effective for adults with sensitive skin highly recommended
2	mustela makes a big thing about their products being natural and hypoallergenic since i have sensitive skin , i always try a dab of any cream on the inside of my arm \( where the skin is thin \) and wait for a few hours it only took a few seconds to realize that the stretch marks prevention cream was problematic for me ! it made my skin red and irritated , even on the back of my hand where i rubbed the leftover portion when more came out of the tube than i expected i immediately washed my skin but it stayed red for a while and felt like it was burning so what is in this prevention cream \? says aqua water eau , di c12 13 alkyl malate , ethylhexyl cocoate , cetearyl alcohol , dicaprylyl carbonate , hydrolyzed soy protein , butylene glycol , cera alba beeswax cire dabeille , laureth 23 , galactoarabinan , butyrospermum parkii \( shea \) butter , glyceryl stearate , 1 , 2 hexanediol , cetyl alcohol , cetearyl glucoside , glyceryl caprylate , parfum \( fragrance \) , xanthan gum , cetyl palmitate , cocoglycerides , sclerotium gum , zinc gluconate , pentylene glycol , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil , sophora japonica fruit extract , hydrolyzed avocado protein , maltodextrin , citric acid , lupinus albus seed extract , tocopherol \( i apologize for the caps but i this from their site \) none of these are among my usual allergens but many of them i have not heard of i have had problems with some fragrances and a few fruit products fragrance can be anything so it is hard to judge but it is noticeable as soon as you open the tube in ewg 's skin deep database , fragrance is the ingredient that keeps this product from getting a high rating , along with laureth 23 , which they say can cause irritation and organ system toxicity , and zinc gluconate , which can and also has organ system toxicity the mustela website claims good results based on a clinical trial conducted on 26 pregnant women who used this product throughout their pregnancy but personally i cannot recommend it i did not dare to try the second product in the package after the bad experience with the first one it also contains fragrance this set is made in france
5	perfect for touch ups when you do n't want to get a manicure every day for 10 , even better for those with real nails
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	im a mature woman and i have considerable puffiness below the eyes i am also fair skinned and i have been trying to reduce the puffiness by changing my diet but in the meantime i want to cover it up or make it less noticeable i thought this palette would be perfect , and as ive in painting and know a little about highlighting and shadows , i thought this would work for me so i watched a few youtube videos on correcting the under the eye puffiness with concealer and they say to highlight the shadows that the puffiness creates not the actual puffy part which made so much sense i could n't believe i hadnt thought of that and that trick does work ! however i wound up using only one color of the palette , even though i had a few choices to work with but without the palette , i might not have discovered which color actually worked for me doing a bit of research on getting the most out of your concealer , i found out you should apply a powdered foundation first , then you will need a setting powder after applying the concealer and , since i have wrinkles , i have to be careful and not get concealer in the lines because it really them if you watch the videos on the em web site , the model they use for their products is very young , so watching her put on makeup on flawless skin is a bit i think the palette combination is a clever idea and i love the compact because the mirror is large compared to most compacts ive owned the concealer cream has no noticeable perfumes that i could detect so it wo n't take your breath away if you are sensitive to that like i am i do n't care for the brush because i think it the cream in too small of an area and so i would recommend buying a larger one i just use my finger
4	a nice facial cleanser for acne i am approaching 60 and still have break outs and slightly oily skin this is a good cleanser as it does n't strip my skin would buy again
3	while it is medium coverage it does not seem to actually cover blemishes as i layered some of the red from my chin acne faded but did n't disappear it seems to cake in my pores and looked heavy it is easy to apply , start with finger application and blend with a sponge it is smooth , easy to blend , and feels good , not sticky while it does a good job , it does n't cover birthmarks , redness from acne , or tattoos but it does a good job at masking them just a bit so they are not
3	bit on the musky side for my liking full disclosure i have an unnatural love for acqua di gio its citrusy notes make me so happy i love sandalwood , jasmine , and orange a bit of spicy fragrance is cool too it 's why i 've loved gio for so long when i saw that this fragrance is in the citrusy side , i was happy to give it a shot also , bear in mind that i do n't wear fragrance every day , because i enjoy cooking , and you do n't want anything to interfere with the smell of the food according to the marketing notes for l ! ve , it 's meant to hit you with lime at the , and then bring out green notes of leaves in the background that 's fine by me guess what i did n't get \? lime leaves what i did get is this overwhelming musky smell , which i dislike axe body spray me out i hate the stuff , and damn near every teenage boy i know bathes in the stuff l ! ve has a strong musk to it the musk overpowers the citrus , the leaves , and the that was promised that said ! it does have a sweetness to the edges of the scent which is rather nice there 's also a ground note of earthiness rather than freshness why is this good \? it covers the smell of sweat rather other fragrances , that tend towards the lighter , more airy side tend to clash with the natural scent of the body , and will be if you 're one of those types that a lot , l ! ve is your jam it 's got serious staying power one spray \( and no more \) is enough to last throughout the work day , and leave a little bit of lingering fragrance at the end of the day do n't do more than one spray , or you 'll be by the scent it 's better to have it be subtle than something that people can smell before you show up bear in mind that this is eau de toilette , which means that it 's not going to be as strong as an eau de parfum generally , it 'd mean that you 'd need to put more on to get the effect not the case here the fragrance is strong , and has plenty of staying power why did i not rate this lower \? because it does grow on you over time throughout the day , i noticed that it mellowed out from the harsh that i got when i first put it on and , as a product goes , it 's not a bad product it just does n't live up to the promises it makes
5	i was searching for a very rich purple not too dark but a rich bold purple i definitely found it with this color luv it ! ! !
5	great ! ! ! i will use this seller again
4	smells very good has a light scent which is not too strong or overpowering can be used daily i love it !
5	essie is the best nail polish for me and i love the brush
4	color is really sheer i put on two coats and it gave a little bit of lavender color but i can clearly see my original nails slightly different than what i thought
5	this make eye makeup remover works fantastically well what i love about it is that it caused no eye or eye area irritation for me and i have very sensitive eyes and a ton of allergies and sensitivities the other thing i love about it is that you are n't left with an oily feeling i had no feeling that i needed to wash anything off the only downside is that a bottle does n't seem like it lasts long my teen daughter and i having been use this sample for a week or so and out bottle looks like the picture so expect to buy every month \( no down star because my daughter tends to overdo \)
1	this will tear your face up
4	the colors are great for me , it goes on smooth , it gives just a little sparkle which is a nice look as long as it is n't heavy it is not a shadow that will last all day though i found that it rubs off easily or just wears off during the day so it would need to be touched up at some point during the day it also leaves a crease after a while which in all fairness most eye shadows do i have had a hard time finding a shadow that will not crease at some point during the day
4	when used alone , this product is n't much its a thin clear gel that does n't bubble and has no exfoliation beads but when paired with my clarisonic , its awesome ! this gel covers the clarisonic brush head evenly and moves out slowly as i clean my face it rinses easily and leaves my skin smooth and clean
5	it 's a little lighter than expected , but that 's ok with me it goes on smooth ! love it
5	this is the best eye make up and mascara remover that i 've ever tried it even removes that thick type mascara that goes on in one or two swipes and looks almost like fake eyelashes the stuff looks pretty great until you go to remove it you know how even after you think you have mascara all off , you wake up in the morning with fake dark circles under your eyes from leftover residue you did n't notice the night before \? well , this remover will get all of that off with very little effort it seems to melt all the away it has a slight oily feeling , but not enough to leave a lot around after you wipe it off there 's just enough to soften the skin around your eyes and provide a little moisture and it 's fragrance free , a great feature in a make up remover that you use around the eyes the product looks just like it does in the picture with 2 layers i had to shake it pretty hard to make it stay combined long enough to pour some on a tissue to apply it but it worked perfectly , so who am i to complain \?
2	i'm surprised that so many people think this cleanser smells good i guess i'm in the i think it smells very antiseptic like the old lady smell i do n't care for it others have mentioned their skin felt tighter mine just felt dryer and slightly irritated it 's definitely not the cleanser for me
4	this is a big , chunky bar of soap that fits with baxter 's line very nicely it 's a little too big for me , but a good size for my husband 's large hands ! the smell is gentle and not too strong , which is fine for him , although i prefer my soap a little more aggressive it lathers nicely and washes off clean , leaving skin feeling fresh but not tight i found the size to be a drawback outside of the sized for a guy 's hands issue , which is fine it does get a bit gooey on the bottom and since it 's so big , it takes longer to dry back out you have to turn it over to the less gooey side every time you use it not a big deal for me , this would n't be a repeat purchase but it 's a good gift for a man in your life who likes a bit of pampering now and again
5	this is a wonderful body lotion having experience with other vichy products , the quality of this lotion came as no surprise the lotions goes on smooth and does n't leave skin feeling greasy or it has a light , pleasant scent that you can smell during application , but does n't leave a lasting odor unless you put your nose right up against the skin a little bit of this product does go a long way , and there is definitely no need to go overboard with it i can easily see this product becoming a regular part of the skin care routine
4	now i 've heard everything i know caffeine helps perk me up but never knew it helps to perk up the eyes too the list of ingredients are as follows pro niacin improves skin tone , texture hyperpigmentation peptide blend collagen elastin to visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles vitamin c , licorice , white birch brightens to illuminate under eye discoloration caffeine reduces appearance of puffiness does it do all that \? well , i would n't go so far as to say it does , at least not for the first three times i 've used it the eye cream does n't say it works better over time , just that it helps each time you use it frankly , i just like that it 's a good eye cream that 'll keep the skin around my eyes from feeling dry and does n't irritate my eyes it 's color and dye free , non comedogenic , and does n't have a scent that i can detect
1	it may be an old essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails
2	i understand the concept of creating a spa line for men i respect that this body wash could be used by a man or woman the scent is bad it reminds me of cheap imitation perfumes it actually gave me a headache it does clean the body other than that , i do not have anything good to say about it
2	i am not a fan of this polish it has a relatively dull finish and take 3 4 coats to effectively coat the nail i would not recommend that other people purchase this polish
5	great company and great product !
5	super pretty color goes on in two coats and shines beautifully like all cnd shellac
5	such a bright cheery coral color ! i bought a few extras for my bridesmaids love the shimmer to it , actually matches the color in the bottle really well i 've had others in this shade \( in the bottle \) that look fire engine red on the nails this does n't do that love it on my toes !
5	purple is my favorite color this rocks \)
2	perhaps my wrinkles need an anti \? i 've been using this on my forehead faithfully since i got it , and i do n't notice any change in the appearance of my expression lines it 's tempting to try these things out and fortunately , i got to do that for free if i 'd paid the price for this cream , i 'd probably earn a new expression line
5	love this scent ! perfect for everyday not too heavy , but also not sweet i can easily wear this out and about without feeling too just a nice smooth scent that actually does n't give me a headache it seemed like it does n't last as long as my standby , dot , so you might need reapply if you need it to last all day overall very pleasing !
5	i have used a great many tea tree products in the past and , while i like the scent , my family does n't so , i hesitated when trying this , worried that the smell would be off putting or annoying well , it turns out , no such thing here ! the scent is so mild that had i not known that it was tea tree , i would have never guessed therefore , if you are sensitive to scents , you have no worries here and , while it is a little thick , it can be worked into skin pretty quickly \( but , it did require some massaging \) the overall effect was nice my feet were well hydrated , looked lovely and felt super soft and , no one in the house was complaining about that tea tree smell \( which is great \)
1	powder color is off , much lighter than expected , not the same as i have gotten before but should be can not compare to bare minerals
3	not fragrance free , how odd fyi not an antiperspirant , so not for the occasion you want to stay otherwise the compact size is wonderful and the aluminum free is wonderful
5	i'm super picky when it comes to moisturizers any scent is usually overpowering for me , so i am happy to report that this moisturizer does n't really smell like anything i'm a little confused that it has a bit of a pink hue to it reminds me of calamine lotion a little bit \) it is so thick when it comes out of the bottle , it definitely sinks into the skin and provides hydration for an extended period without any greasiness i 'd definitely pick up a larger bottle in the future ! this tiny one will probably be enough for the dark settle winter , though
4	i have two little boys so change a lot of diapers and wash my hands a lot the back of my hands get very dry and chapped i also get occasional eczema , especially in the winter this cream helped alleviate the dry skin but did n't help with the itchiness as much as i thought it would it 's nice smelling and a creamy texture the color is a dark beige , which is darker than other creams i 've used it 's an overall good cream and in with some other high quality creams i have tried
5	love it , fast ship trust which is very great business relationship with customers buyers need to trust them and buy it because i have great positive feel with them
4	this shine mist is a nice , small size that adds some nice shine to your hair ! though i am not exactly sure what a seaberry is supposed to smell like , this one has a nice and refreshing scent that is pleasant but not overpowering i have fine , thin hair , so i am careful with adding sprays because it can weigh my hair down too much and make it too flat this is lightweight spray , which is great ! i actually use it the most when my hair is pulled back in a pony tail but make sure to wait until it has dried before re doing a pony tail because it does leave a residue on your hand otherwise ! i find that it does make hair shinier and helps keep any minor flyaways in place ! i do n't use this every day , but i do like it on the days that i do use it !
3	i'm almost done using this product and wo n't purchase again i need something more moisturizing i have wrinkles or bags under my eyes , just dry skin , so this just n't for me
5	i loved this nail polish , i had seen it around the blogosphere and was so excited to try it ! i ordered three different essie polishes , and they arrived before scheduled time ! highly recommended seller !
5	on time shipping and , brand new ! !
5	i love this stuff it does n't run and it lasts all day
5	thanks \)
5	i was curious to try this because i work as a and am sometimes self conscious to teach when i have visible body acne or bruising i was curious if this would work for my purposes would it be able to stay on during class without sweating off and transferring \( granted , i do n't sweat as much as if i were working out myself , but do sweat a bit throughout class \) i was pleasantly surprised i applied it according to the website directions and it stayed on throughout class i also made sure to wash it off immediately afterwards in the shower and did n't find that it caused additional breakouts or clogged pores i definitely have appreciated it for my purposes and also think it makes me less worried about whether i might have a body breakout before a big event i would definitely use it for those purposes as well knowing that it stays in place really well so i would n't worry about it coming off onto my clothing or other people
1	i 've used a full of elemis products for over a month and am leaving reviews on each one regarding the marine creme , i have n't found it to be of any use elemis boasts this as their most popular product but i ca n't understand why as i see no real benefit in fact , my complexion was more congested after using this considering the massive price tag , this earns it a very low rating i personally think elemis reviews their own products with high marks as part of their marketing because i find most of them to be shockingly overrated
5	the only brand i buy for hair tools
2	here are some thoughts on my overall experience with this product 1 \) the delivery system is less than ideal dipping one 's finger into a jar repeatedly encourages contamination a pump bottle is a better choice since it is a bit more sanitary likewise , for a dropper system so , one has to keep a closer watch on this jar than one would with a dropper or pump bottle any change in consistency or odor and one should dispose of it promptly \( especially since it is applied to the delicate eye area \) so , while the jar may be cosmetically lovely in one 's cabinet , it is not the best choice 2 \) the scent is one notices it when one opens the jar and removes the seal it seems tolerable \( similar to a very strong raw shea butter \) but the scent does not dissipate thirty minutes later , it 's still there an hour later , when i turned my head , i could literally still smell it i doubt that it 's an added fragrance \( one probably would not to add this scent \) , so it may be organic to the product itself nonetheless , it does wear on one and those sensitive or allergic to fragrances may find themselves unable to use this product just proceed with caution 3 \) while i was able to pat it under my eyes , and it seemed to be absorbed into my skin , i later went to remove my contacts , and it just rolled up in little balls with a mere touch so , i would advise not to touch the area after application \( and to avoid side sleep because the same happened with my pillow cases \) rather than trying trendy cremes with pearl dust , gold flakes , or truffles , simply try a retinoid they are the gold standard \( and they have nearly no scent bonus \)
4	delicacy is closer to a light peach or pink peach shade with a very muted shimmer very sheer with one coat and opaque in 4 coats but incredibly thick by that point
4	i'm not a chemist , and have no idea what is in this stuff i do not have many wrinkles , and the ones i do are very fine \( around eyes and across fore head \) i do n't see much of a difference after using this for a week around my eyes , but i can say , it did seem to be working on the fine lines on my forehead , and i did see an actual difference immediately i will report back and add to my review after i 've used it after 4 weeks it smells absolutely great , by the way , and it seems to be a very fine , light moisturizer
5	great neutral color i think it would look good on most skin tones one in the set of oprah 's favorite things 2013
5	this sunscreen has a yummy mango cream scent that 's lovely and different from the typical sunscreen smell i use this on my face and have n't had any burning it does n't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky and , best of all , there 's no white residue ! the mango smell is moderately strong when you 're applying the sunscreen , but quickly dissipates i'm only using a bit on my face i do n't know how it would be if i slathered it all over my body nice smell , no burn i like this sunscreen
5	this formula is a bit stronger than the usual mario badescu enzyme cleansing gel that i use , but it 's a nice change it 's thorough and refreshing and does not dry out my skin
5	i have used this product for years , i use it only once or twice a week , but is is very effective i recommend it
3	this product is made with quality ingredients and i had high hopes for it but my husband did not like it at all he said that he got several cuts and
5	works great
5	chi hands down is the best leave in treatment i have ever used my only regret us not knowing about this product sooner i put just a dime size amount in the palm of my hand and then rub it into freshly washed and conditioned hair i am very pleased with chi and i cannot imagine ever using another product
3	it is a nice cream and does n't leave a sticky or tacky feeling to your face i have n't used it long enough to know if it will truly help with my wrinkles and i will have to get back her to let you know after about a month the one thing i can tell you is that it is too perfumey and the smell will last quite a while it does seem to wear off after a couple of hours but it is not a perfume or scent that i care for i would prefer unscented to having perfume under my nose and perfume can be an irritant plus drying to the skin so my question to the company is what were you thinking \? if it were not for the scent i would give it 4 stars for being creamy and easy to spread and absorbs so that there is n't a tacky feeling left
5	my wife loves her eye shadow , and i ordered this for he to try out here 's her take the presentation was classy and professional , and she liked not having a poorly made applicator she 'd never use thrown in the colors are prettier and vibrant in person with a bit of a sparkle in the tone the colors can be used for highlighting , sculpting , etc depending on the look she 's after , and the warmer brown is something she does n't have from other products it glides on and lasts all day removes well with remover but otherwise stays put all in all , she she 's it as a complement to her mac or urban decay eye shadow and is looking for more shades from julep
5	love this brand and love this product ! i use it for both a base and top coat it dries quickly and nice an shiny i am very rough on my hands \( always in hot water , etc \) and it holds up nicely i'm definitely a convert !
4	good
5	love the color and the quality of essie dark blue navy is pretty in as a color this year so i plan on wearing this polish a lot
4	item as described ! worked great !
5	awesome color the perfect dark blue
3	heard a lot of recommendation and good review about this but personally i do n't think it did much help first of all , this did not really do anything to my pimple second of all , it is really hard to just rub it off
1	this product is sticky and the jet of spray shoots out fast and with little control i really do n't care for this product at all
5	love the color very summerish it 's a great polish and the price was great less money than i have seen it at any store the quality is great too they use it at all the nail salons
5	i used mustela pregnancy belly \( previously called double action mark cream \) with my two previous pregnancies , and had no stretch marks due to pregnancy now that i am pregnant with my third child i have used this new version daily , and continue to have no stretch marks this may be genetic but i continue to use this product hoping it is helping ! when not pregnant i have stretch marks on my hips and of my legs i 've been using the stretch mark cream on those areas this pregnancy as well and have noticed that they are diminishing in appearance and are less noticable i 've also noticed that my skin is so soft where i have used the products my skin also feels less itchy from the stretching skin this is the first time i have used the bust serum and i'm a fan i use it on my bust area , chest , and up to my neck area it goes on smoothly and does not have a scent these are both a must have for every pregnancy !
4	here 's yet another cream that promises anti aging i'm always skeptical it 's not that creams do n't help slow down aging they do it 's more that i'm skeptical that a 60 cream \( like this one \) is really 10 times better than a 6 cream i certainly ca n't tell and you may not either still , for those who want to pay premium for a cream that smells like truffles and might deliver something that is twice as good as the 6 cream , then this works
5	i love it , warms pretty fast , and make nice curls ! !
5	great product , been using it for years shipped quickly
5	i use this product every day and love the way it helps to cover the thin spots in my hair i will order it again
5	picked this out at the nail salon today wanted a pink that was pale but not too pail to wash out my hands love it ! perfect pail pink color with a tiny bit of sparkle
4	this perfection spf 50 sunscreen from replenix is a tinted , physical sunscreen that evens out skin tone a little and provides oil absorption to boot i have oily , aging skin but i am trying to slow down the aging by wearing a sunscreen on my face , neck and hands most of them make my skin crazy oily after as little as 30 minutes but this one does n't it really does seem to absorb oil , just as replenix claims the tint is enough to even out skin tone a little but it 's not enough to hide scars or acne or melasma it 's a light tint while it is spf 50 , it is not waterproof so plan on using a different sunscreen if your at the pool or the beach it 's a physical sunscreen , which means it uses minerals that sit on the skin and literally physically block the sun 's rays from reaching your skin in this case , it is 16 2 zinc oxide it also has additional ingredients that address the signs of aging so it 's more than just a sunscreen i really , really like this but it 's just too expensive for me to use every day however , i'm happy to have it for times when i am going to be in the sun in a group and do n't want to go bare faced this gives just enough color to make my skin look less blotchy and and just nicer
4	this is truly waterless ! i had my doubts , but it does an excellent job cleaning without water and the brushes are dry in mere minutes vs overnight with my usual brush shampoo i found the scent to be lovely and not overpowering , unlike other reviewers , however , i have sensitive skin and the fragrance may not agree with me long term it is too early to tell the pump action is easy to use and it has a narrow spray angle so you do n't waste a lot of product with overspray pros easy to use do n't need water brushes dry almost instantly so you could switch colors immediately thorough cleansing , product is largely alcohol based so it will reduce eliminate bacteria on the brushes 3 oz size would allow you to put it in your carry on bag for flying so it is travel ready cons pricey ! this is a small 3 oz spray bottle and it takes a fair number of sprays for even a small brush to get completely clean so i do n't imagine it will last very long scented even though i like the scent my brush shampoo is fragrance free which is probably better for my sensitive skin in the long run overall i like the cleanser and will use it every now and then when i'm in a hurry to clean my brushes but i 'll probably use my brush shampoo more often because it is fragrance free and more cost effective
4	erno 's moisturizer is rich , smells pleasant , and has spf , which is hard to come by in expensive facial lotions the lotion comes in a large plastic bottle with a screw top lid the bottle is a lot bigger that the lotion that it contains , and at 1 7 ounces , it is not much thankfully , the lotion is very thick and a little bit goes a long way it keeps my combination \( dry cheeks and temples , and an oily t zone \) sensitive skin smooth and moisturized throughout the day the lotion has a slight fragrance that reminds me of cold creme the scent dissipates almost instantly so it wo n't interfere with any other perfumes that you may wear the lotion absorbs instantly and does not leave behind a sheen or greasy feeling it did not cause me any allergic reactions all in all great daily facial moisturizer
4	the lumarx women 's foil shaver is a very nice option for women it fits in your hand well , and is surprisingly not slippery as with most electric shavers , the shave is never is close as with a razor the shave also has a trimmer feature , although a little on the large size for a woman the charge time on this shaver is very long , at least twelve hours for a full charge , but it 's difficult to tell because it does not have an indicator i nice product that could use some design , but still a very solid choice
4	i was very curious about how this cleanser would work , since slathering oil on my face did n't sound very clean but i saw the positive reviews and thought i 'd give it a go this oil has a very light neutral scent it does n't smell nice or bad , and i ca n't really describe it at all a single pump is enough for your whole face it feels pretty nice going on , but i am not fond of the emulsion process \( you are supposed to wet your finger tips and then massage the oil into your skin \) it feels kind of messy and and i do n't enjoy it next you are supposed to rinse and then pat dry , but you will still have oil on your face after that which is fine , it does n't feel bad some reviewers say that it makes their skin feel soft or smooth , but i did n't notice any particular benefit as a makeup remover , this is great , and that is probably all i will use it for in the future i do n't like it much as just a cleanser i have yet to try the suggested spa treatment , but it sounds awesome you take a warm wet cloth and pump some oil onto it , use it to massage your face , then rinse and finish by laying a damp cloth over your face and just relaxing
5	i love shellac so trying out the different colors is fun for me this is a good going out on the town color
5	love opi !
5	this cleanser is soft , easy on the skin , and lathers well my skin is already fairly clear this cleanser keeps that way and keeps is healthy and soft recommended
3	it 's a sad day when you get old enough that the hair you want starts to thin but hair starts growing where you do n't want it i recently started noticing hair in my nose and did n't like it this takes some getting used to but it is small and easy to use it a little but does n't hurt like the hairs out would i have n't had the problem with it coming apart that other reviewers have mentioned , but i am kind of with it and have n't used it very long yet i ca n't see whether i have ear hair that needs trimming so have only used it for my nose hairs
5	i liked this product it provides light moisture but also leaves a natural and lightly matte finish its no a super matte finish but more of a natural shine remover did not last 8 hours for me doesnt contain silicone so my make up did not pill and roll off i like to use it as a primer
5	this is a pretty large bottle , so it is a good value crabtree and evelyn is one of the best lotions out there , and this one is no exception it goes on easy and absorbs quick it leaves your skin soft and touchable i love this scent too , light and clean i will definitely be back for more
5	i 've been using everything vichy for years gel moisturizer , day cream , night cream , toner , and masks this was new for me and frankly , i'm usually of the that the cleanser does n't really matter all that much i 've been using foaming cleanser in the blue bottle , and it does fine i 've also tried other brands but it 's never been something that has made me go , wow , great stuff ! until now yes , vichy has surprised and delighted me again see , this does n't feel like cleanser \( or milk for that matter \) it 's thick like a soft cream it stays on the skin and does n't drip into the sink it stays were you put it until you washcloth it off and that is somehow lovely it feels like silk and i like the control that it is n't dripping into my eyes or on my shirt the smoothness is incredible it does n't exfoliate at all \( and it does n't promise too \) sometimes at the end of a very bad day , exfoliation feels like yes , i'm fragile sometimes ! so this goes on , and i let it sit and \( no joke , clean the area around my sink \) then wash rinse off then to the night or day cream i choose i feel pampered i'm not a paid in fact , i liked vichy when they first came out as they sent me \( i have no idea why this was ten years ago \) a small trial size set of their products and that struck me as nice and smart and of course , introduced me to a brand i would have never considered so i like this , everything about it and this cleanser is cheaper than bliss and philosophy by far and , an important note is vichy does n't add icky fragrance to sting your eyes if you ever try bliss' makeup melt off , you 'll know what stinging eyes feels like ! very pleased to try this and am ordering more today so as not to be without in fact , now i 've switched i think the cleanser can be as important as the moisturizer and if your moisturizer already pleases you , you could still use this good stuff ! and it did n't make me break out as some cleansers that are too strong
5	this is a really soothing product when you have over done a bit in the gym or out on the riding your bike it 's cooling and you can feel it working almost instantly
5	my favorite combination !
1	these razor blades are way overpriced i have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper the astra or derby blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper
4	well , it feels nice , not too heavy going on the color because it is was a little difficult to know that you 're getting the right one i am a lighter medium shade as it turns out beige no 3 when applied is a tad darker than you would expect also , a faint peachy orange tint to it but over all a good brand
4	i'm enough to realize there is never going to be a wrinkle cream that truly takes off the years or erases wrinkles lines however , i'm also vain enough to try anything new to just in case i'm wrong i have to admit that this is not a miracle cream , but i feel like when i apply this cream \( i'm only using it on the neck area \) that there seems to be just a touch more suppleness than prior to applying there are two things i do n't love about the product , and the only reason i did n't give five stars first , the smell is rather strong it does n't stink , but it reminds me of something an older female relative used to wear , and i ca n't quite place it , maybe something like an old estee lauder type of face lotion the other thing i do n't love \( but is n't keeping me from using it morning and night \) is that is takes a rather long time to absorb , leaving my neck just a touch sticky , but it does eventually go away i think applying lightly is the key to this not being too big of a problem
5	i think this product marks the first time i have ever purchased something after seeing it in a magazine ad but i happened upon the ad a day or two after spending 20 minutes trying to remove glitter polish from my fingers and toes \( the acetone i 'd been scrubbing with stripped all the oils from my fingers , too , and made my hands really dry \) i love glitter polish , but what a pain ! so i had to try this this was very easy to apply it goes on fairly smoothly and evenly it 's white when you put it on but it dries \( mostly \) clear i used two coats to make sure i got even coverage then i put on some glitter polish \( i 've now used this with two different zoya glitter polishes \) the polish went on perfectly i did notice this shrinks a bit more than other base coats , so you would want to try to get some on the edges of your nails and over to the other side if you can \( my nails were too short to do that , unfortunately \) chipping length of wear were the same as with other base coats and with no base coat i touched up in a few places and then it came time to take this off and i was amazed for most of my nails , the polish came off in a single sheet all i had to do was start peeling at a corner \( i usually chose the cuticle end \) on a few nails , there were more pieces when i was done , i barely had to use one cotton ball with acetone to clean up , and that was mostly on the edges where i 'd done touch ups it was so fast and easy ! it did n't do any damage to my nails , either so anyway , this stuff is great it smells like elmer 's glue , and it very well might be something quite similar but i love that it comes in a bottle with a brush like any other base coat this is one nail product i may finish off completely ! one note , though do n't soak your hands in warm water or your nailpolish will slide right off this must be water soluble it was fine through regular length showers but when i tried to take a bath , i lost my manicure !
3	good gentle cleanser for what you pay though there is better on the market with out the hidden harmful chemicals
5	i have recently tried a different oil moisturizing product which did not do well for me , so my thoughts were that the l'occitane divine youth oil would be another such product turns out i was completely wrong the youth oil has a beautiful scent when you put it on and fades away over hours i followed the directions and put it on in the evening and after only one day , i could feel that my face felt softer to the touch after a week , it feels really soft i use only a drop or two an evening and at that rate , this bottle will last a long time i thought it was rather expensive but when the price is broken out over at least three months \( which is what i am currently for my use \) , it wo n't be any more expensive than some of the moisturizing products that i already use from clinique the bottle is lovely to look at and the dropper is easy to use just a drop or two into your hand and work into into your face using both hands that 's as simple as it can get it only takes a minute or two to apply i then rub the remaining oil into the backs of my hands which are now feeling softer , too i figure why waste even a tad of a drop \? this is a product that i will continue to use in the future and i recommend it to anyone with dry skin to help keep your skin as moist as possible
5	i love this stuff it makes my skin look glowing and dewey all day it 's the first thing i put on my body when i get out of the shower i have dry skin and it makes my face feel awesome
2	this is not really neon you have to put 3 coats since it 's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat
5	i love the vichy products and this cream is no exception it goes on easily and absorbs quickly a little goes a long way
5	part of my daily skin care regiment very good product
5	one of my jane iredale favorites
5	great product !
4	it 's jack black ! ! works well
5	while the container is n't very big , and much smaller than other nail polish , most colors do n't get used enough before they go bad , so this works for us \( although if you are a heavy user this might be a bigger deal \) goes on nice and smooth , does n't chip , and has a nice subtle coloring
5	i have used this product for a little over a year and find it excellent i put it on my face prior to my foundation and then i mix a bit in with my foundation and i get a lovely dewy look when you are 58 and live in colorado that 's not so easy to accomplish \)
5	favorite shampoo for color treated hair , gives body and shine
3	this smells amazing for about an hour and then it dries down to just the remnants after the drydown it reminds me of a 1980 's polo esque scent i know it 's just because it 's toilette and mostly alcohol , but still i would n't buy this version of it if i could find one that lasted longer
5	the strivectinlabs 5 minute weekly glycolic peel is easy to use each bottle is clearly marked it actually takes a bit longer than 5 minutes , as there is some prep work and cleanup work after , but it 's really simple and easy to follow the first time i used this , i think i slathered a little too much on the second and third time , it got a little better so far , i think the result are encouraging this is a very expensive product , but given that it 's a weekly use and you do n't need much of it , i could see these lasting a very long time maybe a full year , but i do n't know if they would start to lose their effectiveness at that time regardless , this is a nice addition to my weekly routine , and i will continue to use it
5	this perfume is made of cherry blossom , mandarin , rose , sandalwood , bare musk , and some more notes , but all so its perfect for daytime , not very strong but refreshing , uplifting , and feminine my 6 yr loved it too \) as some reviewers said that it fades after a few hours , it is true , for me it was 5 6 hours period but then i would not want a perfume on me for the whole day , i would get sick of the smell , so actually its a positive thing for me that it fades away after a few hours i would definitely recommend this perfume , its a great addition to my perfume collection
5	this is a truly amazing product i have very sensitive skin that is dry to combination i was very surprised that it did n't burn , sting or make my skin brake out in a rash i apply at night and in the morning i wake up with me face feeling like a babies butt highly recommend it
4	fast shipping , product just as described
5	this is a wonderful product ! i have very dry skin and it is sensitive to many body creams plus i am allergic to most fragrances this cream helps my skin to feel soft while not being greasy or leaving a film and no fragrance ! love it ! !
5	this is a tiny miracle bottle it contains salicylic acid which is a in skin care for blemishes it comes in a small bottle but a tiny drop lathers and goes a long way the smell is strong as if you can feel it working i think it is clearing my skin daily the more i use it recommended
3	this was very thick for a concealer i 'd have to agree that it definitely does its job , but the consistency was a little much if you 're going for a more natural or everyday look i 'd recommend this for something like a party , but definitely not everyday wear i would n't buy this again
5	i use this for a natural look love it ! shellac last for 2 weeks and no need to have nails done !
5	great shampoo it has a nice light fragrance and with just a quarter sized squirt , this bottle should last a long , long time they sell a conditioner to match but i really do n't think it is necessary it leaves your hair feeling soft and clean there is no heavy residue like you get with some shampoos
5	this is now my favorite daily , after shower body cream it is super luxurious it has a very light but extremely pleasant scent it is a thick , smooth cream that really helps dry to very dry skin as i have gotten older , my skin on both my arms and legs has needed added moisturizing i am really pleased that i was able to try this product from vichy not only does it do a superb job of moisturizing dry skin , it also leaves your skin feeling very smooth and soft and there is no sticky or oily residue i like the convenience of using a jar rather than a pump , as i can take as much or as little cream as i need at any given time the price is a little higher than some of the other brands of drug store moisturizers , but it is definitely worth every penny it is wonderful
5	the jar contains 60 adorable purple which , when popped open , can be squeezed to a white silky fluid which can then be smoothed into one 's face i often find that moisturizers leave a little too much of a sheen on my skin , and would rather have a substance that leaves my skin looking healthy but dry rather than looking like i forgot to dry my face after a shower , or like i 've just spread a thin , albeit clean , film of motor oil on my cheeks the feel of this smoothing product is unlike any other product i 've tried , sort of like running a thin film of silk onto my skin the liquid leaves my face feeling well moisturized throughout the day , without the dry chapped skin that i often get in the winter , but without looking like i 've used product does it actually smooth out wrinkles \? well , perhaps the very fine lines around my eyes , but more than that has n't responded to any over the counter product now if i could only keep my girlfriend from using these , i might actually get the full 60 use from the jar
5	7 16 update just bought another tube i can never be without this again it 's like it magically last 24 hours bc i 've checked myself the next day thought i can use my old oh no , 2 hours into my sweaty shift , i was reminded why i love this upgrading to 5 stars btw , does soothe after shave as well original review first , i have to say i thought when i read this was a cream i was going to have to put it on with my finger which made me a bit hesitant to try the tube has a rounded tip that allows you to squeeze apply like a roll on so bonus point right there \( see pic \) the tube is about 3 inches long so , about half the size of a roll on stick travel friendly you squeeze tube until 1 2 of cream comes out and rub it into your skin with the rounded tip like applying lotion now , a little background on what this deodorant was up against \( poor guy had no idea of the it was about to encounter \) i work special events in formal wear \( white long sleeve shirt , black polyester and tie , black pants \) in the florida humid , sticky , brutal heat i carry deodorant body spray with me because no matter what i use , after about an hour i ca n't stand the smell of myself my uniform creates a of heat with no escape all i can say it 's after 8 hours running , sweat dripping from my face , i'm clean now this is a deodorant not anti so it 's not designed to keep you dry but i'm pretty fresh it goes on white creamy so maybe not little black dress approved but this will save you in the summer heat there is no scent so should work on the all i can say is , i took a chance on this because i love my vichy after shower skin firming cream in the pink tub i'm glad i did this is a game changer thank you vichy ! ! you 've done it again ! !
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	xen tan makes the best self tanners they smell great , and if you select the right color for your skin they produce a beautiful natural tint this weekly med dark mousse smells of yummy vanilla \( which dissipates quickly \) and is the perfect color for my fair , untanned skin that has an olive undertone this xen tan mousse also has an olive undertone and results in such a natural golden tint that 's so compatible with my white pasty skin two applications produce a deeper golden color , but one application on my light skin is perfect for a nice subtle color on my body and especially my super pale legs this xen tan mousse can be used for the face and body i already use a medium daily xen tan lotion that i love for my face , so i'm using this med dark mousse on my body only \( but not hesitate to apply it to my face \) this is a foaming mousse with a lighter consistency than xen tan lotions that dries really fast i find it so quick and easy to apply i like using a xen tan tanning mitt , but applying it with my hands also results in a nice streak free application this mousse leaves my body with an even healthy , natural golden color that suits me much better than darker tanners i 've tried the dark tanners result in a beautiful tan look , but they seem better suited for people with a darker skin tone or who want to extend or even out an existing tan this xen tan mousse seems best for pale skin like mine this xen tan mousse is ideal for fair skin people who are n't going for a dark tan look and instead want a healthy looking natural golden brown tint thus tanning mousse me of that glow in the dark white look on my legs and gives me a nice golden color , yet it 's so natural i'm not sure anyone else would notice in fact , the color is so natural that applying the mousse to my legs makes them look the same color as my arms , which i do n't try to tan but are darker than my legs just from walking around in the california sun two applications of the mousse still results in a natural color , but turns my skin a little deeper shade of a beautiful golden brown color this tanner does n't produce a dark tan like some other xen tan tanners but this xen tan med dark weekly mousse is my personal favorite for my body \( especially my legs \) as it results in such a healthy golden color compatible with my fair skin it 's a shade that suits me year round because it looks so natural that it wo n't appear odd even in the months i 've tried a number of xen tan and other brand tanners , and this one takes the least effort to get a smooth application maybe it 's because the mousse is n't as thick as a lotion and dries more quickly , plus the color is n't too many shades darker than my natural color i love that , like other xen tan tanners , the color just fades away evenly rather than leave blotches this xen tan mousse is exceptional given how easy it is to apply smoothly , and it 's perfect for untanned light skin as it adds a subtle but golden tint that looks even and natural there are times \( summer \) i want to look tan and use a darker xen tan tanning product , but this mousse is my favorite and perfect for year round use because it 's so easy to apply and gives my skin such an even golden tone that looks quite natural this is the best tanner ever and gets 5 stars
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	such a pretty nail polish that i 've been wanting for so long ! shipped really fast !
5	cnd shellac is an amazing product that lasts at least 2 weeks when applied correctly when removed correctly it also does not cause any damage to the nails this is a beautiful bright blue color
4	this lipstick goes on pretty smoothly the color stayed on pretty long as far as the shade that i received , 07 , even though i'm a natural brunette with olive color skin , i felt that this shade was a bit too dark and overpowering for me i think a slightly lighter shade would look nicer and a little more natural as far as the price , i'm not sure if it 's worth it in the past i have purchased lipsticks for a quarter of the price , and i felt that they worked just as good as this one that 's the only reason why i'm giving this product four stars instead of five
4	purchased this product in a couple of colors , and i used this pretty pink color first my nails were streaky , but i 'll give it another try i 've use other polish that does n't streak possibly it 's thicker i did n't get a week out of this did have some chipping i think this is more durable than normal nail polish , but not near shellac which grows out before chipping on me this is pretty pink !
3	i ordered the silk 'n blue acne solution device with my year old granddaughter in mind she is , like so many young teens , from periodic outbreaks of acne she and i sat down and opened the box inside were the acne device , a cord , a charging device , and a small booklet of instructions in english and a couple of other languages both she and i read the instructions just inside the front cover is a page of quick start instructions which we both read the first thing they said to do was plug the charger into the wall and place the device on the charger for 6 to 8 hours i would n't call that a quick start but we followed the instructions and then went out shopping and had lunch after we ate , we found a couple of cute summer outfits that worked to my grand daughter 's advantage when we got back , she went in and washed her face with plain old soap and water there was plenty of time for her skin to dry the charging time was still not up she and i waited some more the lesson here is do n't expect to be able to use this thing as soon as you open the package plan ahead we did n't the 6 hour wait was over and we pressed the on off switch a green light to life and finally stayed on ready for action my granddaughter 's blemishes were concentrated on her forehead and chin , so those were the areas she concentrated on with the blue the led light was on and she held the blue against the skin on her forehead for a little over 3 minutes she found the head of the device was getting pretty warm she moved the head of the blue to another place on her forehead every 3 to 4 minutes she thought the heat was getting pretty warm she applied the blue to about 8 areas on her forehead and 3 areas on her chin it took about 40 minutes to get around to all the areas that had blemishes she was through for the evening the blue was returned to the charger so it would be ready the next morning after the blue had been on the charger for another 6 hours , i removed it as i had read in the comments not to leave it on after it was fully charged the directions said to use the blue twice a day for 6 to 8 weeks to start and to repeat the treatments twice a week for maintenance the maintenance schedule seems reasonable but getting there seems to be a real hike to me lucky for my granddaughter , it 's summer vacation but to keep up that starting schedule during the rest of the year would be difficult she managed pretty well through almost 4 weeks of treatments but she was definitely in her the treatments , lasting at least an half hour each , twice a day , were taking up an awful lot of time , time she would have preferred doing other things fortunately , she was showing some fairly decent results with her skin maintenance arrived just in time , or i think she may have given up her skin has been fairly clear now for a couple of weeks and she has been doing the maintenance schedule i hope she can keep up once school starts again we discussed the ratings for this device and she felt the amount to time necessary , especially at the beginning , was a real problem she liked the results aside from the rare new blemish i thought the time spent charging and getting the blue off the charger so it did n't was a pain all in all , we decided that 3 stars were just about right the results were pretty good but it took an awful lot of effort to get there
5	great
4	the results of use seem to be modest and temporary , but real the thing we noticed was that while the ingredients may be organic , that does n't mean they ca n't be irritating to sensitive skin for example , soluble aspirin is part of the formula \( salicylic acid from willow bark \) so if you are sensitive to that , this may not be for you
5	this treatment has the consistency of a thick moisturizer it goes on smooth and clear and then absorbs into the skin , so do not think that this is like a mask i generally have fairly dry skin , especially in the colder months , and i have had good luck with this product keeping my skin moisturized i use it almost every night instead of the few times a week that are recommended the cream has a fairly strong perfumey smell , though , and i would prefer for the scent to be less powerful
4	i 've been using this for about a month now and the one awesome thing i can say is it does n't irritate my face as a mid forty something i 've tried lots of different eye and face creams simply because they irritate my face horribly sometimes to the point of a chemical burn i wait for it to heal and just move onto the next in line this just feels like a light moisturizer there is really no scent to this product i do n't notice it at all when it 's on and absorbed it 's easy to pump just what you need and it absorbs quickly on your face i 've been using \( see example in pictures \) a pump dabbed around my eyes morning and night i do n't have bags but i do have fine lines i do n't know that i 've noticed a lot of difference but my skin does n't feel dry i'm sure i 've not used this long enough to see dramatic results but i do like it and will continue to use it and look for the improvement !
5	i gave this five stars because this stuff is amazing really made a huge difference in my hair repaired the frizz i battle with and repaired the dry ends , they are not split because i just had a trim but we 're very dry from using a flat iron this along with the conditioner has worked wonders for my hair i never use one product to long i like to switch now and than so when i come back to the product it works as , well as the first use i ordered several shampoos and products from oribe and trying to figure out the one best suited for my hair , so far the ones i have used i like so i will be a tough decision this shampoo really does what it says but everyone 's hair is different what works for some may not for others this leaves a brilliant shine also
5	get this it 's close to perfect skins goes from dry to normal in two days , eyes so so much better in 2 days love it love it
5	two coats of polish and one coat of top coat lasts for at least 10 days no chipping , peeling , etc
5	my wife has been using nia 24 for a few weeks now and she is very satisfied with the results she has oily skin , large pores and has issues with skin firmness this product leaves her skin looking less oily and firmer it seems to be fading a few of her dark spots and has improved the texture of her skin she is hoping that results will be even more pronounced as she uses the product longer it has also improved the of her neck and reduced fine lines on her face and neck she has used many products in diverse price ranges and this product is excellent even at this price point
2	this is not really neon you have to put 3 coats since it 's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat
5	wonderful color ! all my clients love this as on any color or just an accent nail good for also
5	received this product on time and was very pleased with the color the color is amazing it 's juicy and summer , but not very bright really love it ! the quality of the product is great it stays minimum two weeks on my nails i am attaching a picture one week old manicure , but still looks great ! thanks !
5	i really like this moisturizer for combination skin it keeps the dry parts of my skin moisturized without making the oily portions of my skin oilier i like that it comes with a scoop so you do n't put your hands in the jar the jar is also very sturdy
5	i love this product it is safe to use and lasts all week long
4	i like most vichy products and i 've tried quite a few there have been a couple of the eye treatments that i did n't really like , but most of their products work well for me the mineralizing thermal water may not be a miracle product but it is very refreshing to my skin my skin dries out in the summer weather and this product is just very refreshing i used to buy a product like this one years ago , i think it was an ayurveda product and this reminds me of that this provides just a light mist of thermal water that is supposed to be very good for your skin and provide essential minerals my skin feels nice and it is soft after misting this little canister of water should last throughout the rest of the summer one misting covers my face and it 's refreshing after washing my face in the evenings
5	need it to work with the nuface machine
5	wonderful stuff
5	i since died my hair and it works well with dark brunettes for medium brunettes this also worked well in my fianc hair which he is asian with black hair so color is definitely darker than expected \( got medium brown \) it came on easy like pepper shaker and apply straight on problem area it sticks and stays until you shower or sweat covered his thinning hair very well ! if you touch it with a brush it will move it does not stick so style hair then put it on as final touches hope this helps update i bought a second one ! i love the mini because you can fit it in a clutch and do n't have to worry about reapplying when you 're out and about ! perfect for those wanting to make their hair look a little more full !
4	i have used this to blend bronzer into my foundation and it works well if i hold it sideways i believe it may be meant to blend foundation and powder \( i'm not that sophisticated about makeup quite honestly \) overall it 's well made though i do wish that it so i could put it in my makeup bag
5	great ! i no longer have to go to the nail salon thanks !
4	great product great shipping thanks
5	the stuff that i use to prevent razor bumps on my chin really dries out my normally oily skin , and this bioderma cream works great for me it works great as a moisturizer on my face and it leaves a really nice matte feeling i do n't feel greasy or oily after applying it
2	i did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because i am a huge la roche posay fan their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly even without getting it directly in them , just in the normal course of washing my face it also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but i could n't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture i swear my skin would make a noise when i rubbed my finger over it after using this so , no thank you , i would like to keep my moisture barrier note i also tried the purifying foaming cream cleanser and it felt exactly the same
4	good wearability
4	the cream to powder concept is interesting i know women of a certain age are advised to powder for rouge , but i never liked that shiny look this is a nice in between it goes on smoothly , and within a few applications , you learn to use a light touch i thought the candid color might be too dark , but it 's a good color for my fair skin with rose overtones the only thing that surprised me was how small the tube was keep in mind that the product is only 0 14 oz
5	i do not remember how many bottles i 've bought already works like a charm
5	i love it ! this is the best hairdryer ever i read the reviews and i thought it was a good product but that it was too much those comments like it dries faster , leaves your hair smooth with no , and less its true ! all this is true ! i have curly hair and freezing hair sometimes , hard to straight well , im impressed by this hairdryer !
5	i am one of those pale skinned who never tan , only burn and then burn more i have the worst history with self tanners the last time i wore one was summer before last we were traveling out of state to a dog show and all i took with me were pants to wear and when my friend saw the back of my calves , she said what did you use to apply the stuff , one of those sponge cleaners for mini \? apparently , it was a bit streaky and orange and generally uneven and darker around the ankle sigh so the first thing you need to do is to buy the sponge glove that is offered for applying this product it is a very nice mitten , with some substance to it and you can easily use it for several applications important the glove needs to be rinsed off before first use to remove some sort of manufacturing process and then it needs to dry before you can use it and since the glove is not a flimsy throw away , the drying takes a bit \( i air dried , unsure how it would last through the dryer \) next , plan your application while some self tanners require a lot of prep \( loofah or other exfoliation , for example \) , this one recommends from 45 minutes to 3 hours of time between application and rinse off \( it does n't say what happens if you just do n't rinse it off , and i'm not the right person to be going all on it to find out , so let us know if you decide to experiment , okay \? \) the product does n't stay wet , so you can put on clothes and go do something in the interim , but you 're going to have pretty strong self tanner scent , so just plan your application time well unless you are very good at yoga , you will also need someone to help you apply to your back the result is terrific it is very even , with no dark spots over knees and other spots where the color usually , even though i did nothing special for those areas using the mitt , i was able to apply around the backs of my legs and even my traveling companion ca n't find fault with the self tan the color is great , not at all orange , but a very natural looking toasted honey on my pale legs since i did n't have help , and because i plan to continue to spare the world any sight of my middle aged , i did n't apply to my however , i am impressed that the product , when applied to my farmer 's tan arms and shoulders , seems to have evened out that change in color that occurs just below the level so far , i 've only applied the one coat , but the instructions do indicate you can build up color over time if you 've ever used self tanner , you are familiar with the scent this product has a very light and pleasant version of it , but it is there , and , despite the rinse off an hour and a half after initially applying the product and then a shower the next morning , i could still faintly smell that baking aroma the next day at work no one else commented on it , however , so it ca n't have been too bad i am so glad to have this product on hand for occasions when i may want to transition to shorts or again in the future
4	nice color for fall
5	this stuff is like botox in a jar amazing !
3	my normal facial skincare routine is currently owned and operated by boscia i use their toner , gel peel , and sake balm moisturizer this thermal spring water seemed to be a semi moisturizer , semi toner sort of product , so i tried it on both a washed face and then during the day as a pick me up honestly , i could see no results from either method it was no more soothing than just misting some distilled water on my face , maybe slightly more moisturizing i will say that it is easy to apply just spritz and go , and it did n't muss up my make up where heavier moisturizers may
5	i 'll caveat this review by saying i'm not a hair stylist and no nothing as in zip , , nada about the tools used in that profession however better half has been a stylist for twenty years and serves as creative for one of the top ten day spas in the united states he knows his scissors and then some based on his feed back hot tools are a top choice for professionals for a couple of reasons they hold up to commercial use have a reliable which apparently is essential , who knew \? solid comfortable grip as for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can make any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter rod the price on amazon was the best beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that only to professionals over the years i 've found this to be true with virtually all tools of trade and recently bought him a pair of 700 for with free shipping to boot as for the curling iron it arrived in it 's sealed retail packaging and again with a prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot
4	here are my wife 's thoughts on this product pros a little truly goes a long way , and this product absorbs very quickly and almost without a trace ! this stuff is clean no residue whatsoever it is so incredibly lightweight and effective your face truly feels moisturized and protected , and i 've never used another product that left my face feeling so soft and supple in the morning cons while fragrance free is generally a good thing , the particular jar i received had a mildly sour smell , almost like play it was n't very strong , but i did n't care for it , and honestly , at this price point i think it 's fair to expect either a scent i like , or truly none at all minus one star for this
4	this is a candle its box directions are pretty funny , if you do n't mind your candle being sort of its instructions are also printed on the glass of the candle , in case you thought you could get away from the it smells pretty nice when it burns , not too overwhelming i did notice a bit of black smoke coming from the wick as it burned , so its a bit of a mood killer there it lit pretty easily and i had it burning for several hours and you can barely tell
4	my absolutely favorite smells have to include light citrus smells this perfume takes the cake over many by being light and refreshing i can distinguish lemon , bergamot , currant and jasmine the way the smells blend is absolutely beautiful my only complaint is that the smell does not last longer than a couple of hours i would expect it to at least linger a little longer , but it even disappears from clothes with wool in them wool is notorious for holding on to smells i feel that if the chemical composition of this scent could be left while adding a component that would make the scent last , it would be an incredible perfume
5	this product makes my hair super smooth and it smells good
4	these were fun to use the package contains individually wrapped foil packets containing either a forehead gel pack , or two smile line gel packs the product consists of thin layers of gel maybe 1 8 thick each with a sticky backing you pull off the backing and then place the layer of gel on your forehead or on either side of your mouth you apply it like you would apply a biore strip or one of those breathe rite things , although it does n't feel as sticky on the skin the gel feels cool and provides a nice pick me up it does n't seem to draw out impurities or clean pores like a mask would rather it feels good whether it is effective at helping wrinkles i do n't know but it is a refreshing and relaxing treat
5	this eye cream is superb and superior to any others i 've ever tried will re purchase it again !
5	this is a great bathtime set that is perfect for my little ones gentle skin each item has a fresh scent to it i really like the baby lotion , as its light and does n't leave your skin feeling oily i 've been using the lotion on my very dry hands , and it 's really helped soften them up the hair and body wash is very gentle against my daughters skin and hair , and a little bit goes a long way you do n't need a lot when using the bubble bath either this is our first time using mustela products and we 're very impressed with this set makes for a great for a baby shower gift too , as this comes neatly packed with full sized bottles
5	i 've owned brushes from mac and from mary kay , as well as various dollar store brands in between the softest i ever felt were the ones from mary kay i do n't know what they 're up to over there , but they 're extremely soft the mac ones are actually kind of rough feeling , to be honest the japonesque brush is somewhere in between in terms of softness i 'd say it 's closer to the mary kay side of softness loose powder the brush holds enough loose powder to be able to lay down plenty of it if you want to go for a lighter application , dust it off on the edge of your powder box i 've used it for the gold dust powder from mac , and it can give you great coverage really quickly same goes for dusting powder of other colours it works lovely pressed powder for pressed powder , i generally do n't use such a big brush , but i wanted to test it out anyway so that you 'll know how it works if you choose to do so it does take up the pressed powder , but it 's not stiff enough to make much of an impression you 'd do better with another brush for pressed powder blending this is where this brush really shines after laying down the and highlights , i can run this brush over the edges to get everything blended down to a fare the well what 's also great is that if your bronzer or blush or whatever other makeup is the wrong colour , you just lift it up with the brush , and then lay it on the skin then , add a different colour to balance it out , and blend because the brush is so soft , you can do the blending directly on your face without irritating it it also works to blend on your table sometimes i 'll lay down two colours to blend them before putting them on my skin this works great there 's a blush that i like whose base is too pink for my liking so i 'll blend it with a spot of orange , and a bit of red to get the colour i want , and then put it on my face this brush works great for that \( granted , the cleanup on my table after a heavy makeup session gets messy , but it 's all with makeup remover wipes \)
4	the life serum is delightful on the skin it leaves a non greasy feel and like most moisturizers minimizes the look of fine lines and wrinkles it has a mild , pleasant scent that does not linger it is actually in cream form rather than a clear serum
5	i love mustela for my kids and myself during winter skin is dry and one of my kids develops eczema mustela products keep the flare ups under control smell is neutral and skin is not stripped from protective barrier some drugstore creams for eczema burn the skin \( like aveeno \) but not mustela highly recommended
5	i got the color mocha although i thought it would be too dark the name does not imply the true color , which was lighter than expected it was plenty of rich color with a golden glow the powder has a buttery feel and glides on easily i used my finger to dab over darker spots and this covered beautifully it even covered the darkness under my eyes , something i have been trying to do with concealers but to no avail i live in a very hot and humid environment , so i do n't like wearing a lot of product i put on a moisturizing primer and this powder this is more than enough for my work day overall , i really like this
5	all essie nail polish are terrific at least thats what my thirteen year old granddaughter tells me
5	this is a generous sample sized jar it is my 3rd little jar of this size i find they last about 2 weeks each with 1x nightly use , or a bit less if used more often , because a little of this goes a long way for me i think this small jar is overall a good value , and certainly , big enough to really have a chance to work , if it is going to , for any given individual if you like it , then you can buy the larger sized jars for me , it works great it is one of my favorite all times anti aging creams , and in general , i really enjoy the vichy brand this does not pill , and it goes on and spreads well , and absorbs well and it leaves my skin feeling overall moist , with just a tad of a natural like oily feeling , not greasy , but like my skin was when i was younger instead of being parched all the time like it is now that i am 50 this works well with serums underneath it , or alone it 's also a good under makeup moisturizer i have not found that it reacts with my makeup to cause piling or shorter wear time all that is one of the reasons it is my favorite these little jars are cute too they are good quality , small enough for a travel bag or desk , and pleasant to hold and use there 's a bit of scent with the product , but it 's very light , and not bad or unpleasant in any way after i put it on , i ca n't smell it it 's very subtle even in the jar with my nose stuck down to it , but it 's not what i 'd call unscented either it does n't smell like perfume , it seems like just the natural smell that emollients have
5	i like this as a for my sometimes oily skin ! it is lightweight , non greasy and feels amazing when i use it i love anything herbal and the scent of this product is quite lovely i also love that it can be used both day and night
4	my husband developed dry skin after his job required him to be clean shaven this is a nice , light moisture supporting face cream while he liked it , it was simply too perfume y for him it had a citrus scent which i like but he found intrusive i 've used it and it is a perfectly fine day moisturizer his loss is my gain i 'd not likely buy this as i have other moisturizers i prefer i will use this up though
4	synthetic brushes are generally better for liquid cream makeup because they do n't absorb the makeup as much and natural brushes generally work best for makeup powders bronzer etc this powder brush has natural bristles it is domed and puts on powder evenly i am not a pro so i prefer a brush like this one , that puts on a smaller amount with control i can always add more if i need to i 've had brushes that put on makeup more heavy make me look clownish besides being a beautiful brush , the handle is comfortable long enough to hold with control however , i prefer a hard , easy to clean handle i think this handle will fall apart over time may even collect keep your brushes clean ! for dry use brushes , wash them at least once a week for brushes you are using with wet foundation cream you really should wash after each use at least a rinse under warm water i wash all brushes with a gentle shampoo but any unscented soap will work i rinse them well with warm water let them air dry not only does this help your brushes last longer stay soft but it is really important to wash out the bacteria dead skin oils makeup that build up quickly on makeup brushes yuck if you do n't take care of them , you can get rashes , breakouts , etc your makeup will be a mess
5	brilliant color and beautiful results two coats is all it takes to get great current fashion color
5	all ok
5	overtly onyx is an incredibly beautiful shellac shade very , very dark blue with gorgeous shimmer one of my favorite shellac shades
5	great cleanser , removes make up very fast , without stripping the skin
4	the juice beauty stem cellular cleansing oil offers a deep cleansing experience it uses a blend of , may chang , ho wood and sunflower oils along with organic fruit acids to brighten skin tone , skin texture and help dissolve impurities juice cleansing oil is recommended to be applied to dry skin one can apply it the face with fingers in a circular massaging way or you can squeeze it into a warm , well out washcloth and massage your face with it i prefer the washcloth as there is warm moisture being applied to my face along with the cleansing oil and the washcloth can pick up impurities along the way the finger method seems to tug at the skin and stretch it unnecessarily especially near the eyes , where one has thinner skin juice cleansing oil leaves the skin clean , nourished , non greasy and smelling good just like you do after a spa treatment ! recommended pros spa like experience in a bottle organic product all natural ingredients leaves skin clean , nourished and rejuvenated without the greasiness two methods of application massage into skin or spray onto moist warm washcloth non abrasive cleansing cons seems to stretch thin skin areas apply gently with care
5	gentle , cleans off makeup , does n't seem to strip my skin , and smells nice
4	this make up remover is great it is gentle on the skin the oils remove make up really well and moisturize the skin no breakouts after using
3	wrong color for me hard to pick a color from a
2	there are a multitude of soaps available on amazon and this is one that i will not purchase again the scent is n't even worth describing due to the fact that it is close to being non existent i used this as a body bar one time it left a residue and dried my skin now it sits in our mud room for people to scrub dirt from their hands
2	my girls did n't find this product to be very effective at removing eye make up they both tried it and told me that it is n't as god as the stuff they normally use they told me not to get this again and said they probably wo n't use it anymore , so i ca n't give this a good recommendation especially at the price it is being sold for
4	the vichy aqualia thermal dynamic hydration cream promotes the fact that it is very hydrating , and i have to agree that it helps to keep my skin feeling well moisturized i can put this on after coming out of the shower and it wo n't feel dry at all , when sometimes after applying a serum i have to apply a moisturizer as well however , it does have a rather chemical smell to it , something that people with a sensitive sense of smell might find unpleasant i have n't had any breakouts from using this serum , though i noticed that it takes a little longer to absorb than other serums i 've tried , some higher end or vitamin e all in all , if you do n't mind the chemical smell or want something that 's not as expensive as others , you should give this a try
5	london polish has always been excellent this color , , is an but and it is perfect the shade can be worn with many different colors of clothing from burgundy , pink browns and beige to blues and greens it is , muted so i there is no clash this is great quality product wears well and has a long shine life all and all a great color and a terrific line of nail products
5	i finally have nails ! thanks in part and largely due to opi nail envy original
5	this stuff is amazing i have thinning spots and this covers and binds to the hair i used to always have to wear my hair up to cover it but i can wear my hair down now and not have to worry about my patches showing it stays in place and does n't wear off throughout the day no more worries i 've been contemplating buying this stuff for awhile after reading someone 's blog about thinning hair i buy the smallest size of these , use it everyday \( a little goes a long way \) and it lasts me a month i just reorder when i get low so buy size accordingly to how much you need get it you wo n't be disappointed get your confidence back !
5	this is a large gift set that would make a nice present at a baby shower or to give to a new mom it includes a 2 in 1 cleanser , a bubble bath , a no rinse cleanser gel and a bottle of lotion with a pump all of it is made to be gentle on a baby 's skin and can also be used by adults with sensitive skin as well they are scented as to avoid anyone 's allergies and each bottle is easy to open best of all , the box can be as it is thick with a window , so you could use it as a photo box or to store other items this is a lovely set and my only small criticism is that i hope the boxes come in different colors , as the blue color is usually associated with boys , though most people today think of most things as gender neutral
4	i have used baxter of california products for years and have always liked them this shave duo kit was something new to me , so i was anxious to give it a try the products in this kit are a pre and post shave tonic spray and an aftershave gel balm they are 4 oz each in size , but small amounts go a long way , and they both should last a long time even with regular usage the tonic spray can be used both before and after shaving since the balm is used after shaving i use the tonic spray only prior to my shave it is supposed to help open pores and condition the skin for a more comfortable shave the instructions say it should be applied with a hot towel , but that it can be sprayed directly on your face messing with a hot towel is more work than i want to put into shaving , so i simply spray it on my face you do have to exercise extra care that you do n't get spray in your eyes the tonic has a nice scent , and i let it sit on my face for a minute or so before brushing on some pre de shaving soap using a double edge razor with a derby blade i find that i get a much closer shave using the tonic that i get without it the razor seemed to glide over my face more smoothly i have had no facial irritation , although i usually do n't get much irritation from shaving with the products i already use after shaving i use the balm and find it makes my face feel quite good a very small dime sized dab of balm is all that is needed it has a very light citrus scent to it that should not interfere with any other aftershave or cologne one might use like all baxter of california products , this kit is expensive it seems like baxter of california prices most everything they sell in the 30 price range but they are nice products and generally last quite a while the shave tonic in this kit does seem to make for a smoother shave , and the aftershave balm is soothing as advertised this kit would be ideal for anyone who tends to experience irritation from shaving those who shave with either a single or double edged razor should find this a worthwhile complement to their shaving routine
4	i got this for my wife who has medium length hair that curls a lot more than she cares she likes the resting pad , clips \( 2 \) and swivel cord \( avoid tangling \) as with many products , one pass is possible if you have thin hair , hair is not too curly and you go slow which of course takes time she did not notice any real time saving with this 4 stars overall it works , but only a portion of the wand is heated and the temperature controls are tricky to get at the desired level she likes it and will continue to use it
5	expensive but worth every penny
5	great set of nice working products ! the clay pomade was the product my husband he is used to a firm hold shiny product that puts his hair in a non state this was different , it has super hold but not shiny it was more of a natural hold , without the fake hair look the moisturizer is perfect ! in fact i have found myself using it so many times ! it is non greasy and fragrance free which is nice i like that it moisturizers without the feel of needing to wash your face , some moisturizers leave such a shiny glow which i hate lastly , the deodorant is great it has a light scent , fresh citrus scent that my husband said worked fine all day went on smooth and kept him fresh , exactly what you want !
5	fabulous color , cnd is always dependable love the line !
5	i do n't use a lot of make up so i just have the basics i had not thought of primer as a necessity boy was i wrong ! this works sort of like the primer on a canvas it fills and smooth 's all the tiny lines and imperfections and foundation goes on like silk the primer is a clear gel and it only takes a tiny bit and leaves a matte finish it dries almost immediately ingredients cyclopentasiloxane , dimethicone crosspolymer , dimethicone crosspolymer , silica , nylon 12 and a dozen other things i had never heard of works well , though
5	best tinted sunscreen on the market
5	i like this because it has a nice light floral scent i'm sure it could still smell awful if someone tried to take a bath in it , as people occasionally do with perfume , but it 's nice so long as you 're reasonable and does n't smell so strong that i think it 'd bother many people the bottle 's pretty too of course , but that 's it 's at a pretty standard level of as far as perfume bottles go
5	my wife is a die hard makeup fan , she watches youtube videos daily about makeup and what not , so when i mentioned dermablend to her , she knew right away what is was she is a natural buff beige , but during the summer months , she buys different shades of cover up to match her skin after she tans , she does not like the white face and brown chest look issue she ran into was colors on our computer screen did not match the colors received , probably due to our display , we checked out the same color on a few different screens , and the shades looked different on all 3 over overall she said it provides great coverage , a little goes a long way , does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great the product is a little pricey , but will last a long time , overall great product , 5 stars
5	i love their products
5	i love zoya polishes and only one salon \( other side of town , of course ! \) sells them this is a great color i wanted something other than a nude pink classic red i could get away with at work , and this is perfect ! i would describe it as a soft , smoky teal not too bright , but enough to get a second look and compliment \)
4	this is a thick eye cream , which comes in a tiny tube of 0 5 ounces it is nicely moisturizing , but too heavy for me to use during the day under eye makeup \( i have very oily lids , so it might be better for someone with dry skin \) i have n't used it long enough to speak about the long term benefits , but in the short term , i like it no irritation or sensitivity issues this is made in france , but for whatever reason , the packaging is primarily in russian
5	this is a great eyeshadow duo the two shades of purple \( with highlights of shimmer , and a bit of pink \) go on easily with a brush and when blended together , look really beautiful the eyeshadow transfers well from brush to eyelid without a lot of dusting transfer \( so it does n't immediately fall off the brush and shower your face with eyeshadow as you apply it \) and it really blends together seamlessly to give your eyes a flawlessly blended look it 's a subtle shimmer and does n't have any harsh lines at all between the colors they just go together so well ! i do wish that these had names , rather than just shade 6 so for reference because of computer color can differentiate , if these were made out of crayons , the lighter shade would be lavender with pink carnation highlights and the darker shade would be violet , but with highlights of fuchsia and silver together they look lovely ! plus , the case is quite lovely and includes a mirror
3	this is a quality product the delivers on its promise i live in hawaii , and this cream does a wonderful job of nourishing my sun soaked skin that said , it smells terrible ! i can only put it on areas of my face above my nose so i do n't have to endure the fragrance it does n't smell like a nice natural product , but instead like some old lady make up type smell ugh
5	before a day of skiing or i always put this on my face neck it keeps my skin soft protected from the cold weather it is not greasy and absorbs in to the skin you wo n't look shiny there is a fragrance that does last an hour or so on my skin so if you do not like fragranced lotion , you may want to look elsewhere
5	this rich night cream is not greasy or heavy , but it is very soothing i have to admit that it would probably work faster and better on younger faces this one has seen a decade or two too many , but , after using this potion every night for a week , i do think some of my finer grooves and seem a little less prominent this is a long term project , though there is enough in this very pretty jar for more than a month , and i may see more dramatic results by the time it is empty for now , i can say that it has not irritated my very sensitive skin , has moisturized , smoothed , and softened the skin on my face , and is making a start at making my wrinkles a little less wrinkly
4	great value in this bliss face kit this facial kit includes a 6 7 fl oz foaming face wash , 5 incredi peel glycolic acid resurfacing pads and a 1 7oz jar of vitamin c day cream i find the foaming face wash , combined with my clarisonic to adequately remove my makeup my skin feels soft and refreshed after use i have not used the glycolic acid pads because of a prescription cream i use i was advised not to combine the two i apply the vitamin c cream in the morning under my foundation and it absorbs quickly into the skin if you price out the items individually , you will discover the value of this set ! it comes in a nice box for gift giving
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i does wonders for big aggressive pimples \)
3	i had a different hot tools version that broke it was the 1 1 4 inch , but was pink , black and silver it really onto my hair this one will curl my hair , but i feel like it does n't clamp down very hard and my hair falls out of it quite a bit or does n't hold the curl as well
5	really works on blemishes over nite ! ! love it
5	i have used this product for about 15 years and i love it i use it in combination with the toner spray and the cream i have very few wrinkles for 62 and attribute much of that to this product
5	this spray provides protection against hair drying , curling irons and flat irons it does n't take much spray to counteract the harmful , heating and drying effects of styling utensils it has a light , almost sweet scent which evaporates quickly but still retains a fresh scent with my use of curling irons , this really the of my hair during heat styling i like it very much and find it improves my condition of hair all the while i use it
3	a bit on the watery side it took a lot of shaking of the bottle to try to mix the liquid inside , but it still came out watery the cream kept separating and did n't blend well i 've never experienced a sunscreen lotion that was so liquid like and looked really unattractive the way it kept separating
5	i love this hair spray since i first found this brand and type several years ago i refuse to use anything else yes it is a bit pricey but it works great ! i love how lightweight it feels , it lasts all day long without breaking down i also like the smell too it does n't have the strange alcohol odor that some do overall a great product no complaints at all about it
5	with bitter cold winds blowing and dry indoor heat , the last thing my sensitive skin needs is an alcohol based cleanser i already trust la roche posay , having been introduced to the brand many years ago in france ca n't tell you how happy i am that they are now available right here , and with the same quality i expect this cleanser is a fun foam , and easily dissolves even heavy foundation it 's a little more work removing lip stains , but that 's to be expected it is truly gentle , and my skin feels clean and refreshed
5	have sensitive eyes plus allergy season takes another toll have not been able to use liquid eyeliners , despite claims of being appropriate for my own eyes until this one the applicator is perfect not hard in that it feels as tho a velvet tool lined my eyes one must shake the unit before applying draws a clean , not artificial looking line , and holds throughout the day removes easily with my clinique take the day off non irritating !
1	essie nail polish usually impresses me , but this polish does not last more than a couple days i would be very surprised if it was real essie
3	this mechanical nose and ear hair trimmer works well but takes more time to use than an electric type the time consuming part is that the hair must fall inside the slits for them to be cut when you close the handles it takes a few tries to get the desired hair \( s \) to fall into the slits i also have a very inexpensive nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href micro personal trimmer dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 micro personal trimmer a nbsp that is faster and easier to use the also doubles as a way to trim any neck hairs that my electric shaver has missed
5	great color and goes on nicely ! love this !
5	my wife is a die hard makeup fan , she watches youtube videos daily about makeup and what not , so when i mentioned dermablend to her , she knew right away what is was she is a natural buff beige in color , but like to have different shades of foundation for the summer , because your skin tone will depend by how much your out in the sun she said it provides great coverage , a little goes a long way , does not need to be caked on and leaves her face looking great the product is a little pricey , but will last a long time , overall great product , 5 stars
4	this is a fairly light cream for a night cream it seems bizarre to me that the instructions suggest using this under your regular night cream why on earth would i do that \? it does seem moisturizing enough to me i'm 44 years old do i look as if i had 2 extra hours of sleep when i wake in the morning , as the bottle promises \? not particularly but my skin is sufficiently moisturized i do think the scent of the product is too strong , particularly for a face cream i would love it on a hand cream , but a very strong perfume y scent right under my nose is a bit much it 's overpowering , and not necessarily the perfume i would choose to wear to bed the cap is an interesting design , because it does n't remove from the bottom but rather twists up and down to reveal a hidden pump the good thing about this is that i wo n't lose the cap or forget to put it back on i do n't usually have a problem with this , but this design makes it impossible i can tell from the design , though , that there 's going to be no way to get out the very last of the product when it 's running low , because i ca n't remove the top and place it upside down over another container , or scrape out the sides of the bottle i know not everyone does things like this , but it really annoys me to have to just throw away a product when i know there 's still some in there ! when the time comes maybe i 'll find a way to pry off the top so i can get to the last 15 20 of the product
4	i rated xen tan transformation ultra weekly tan 4 stars because it is a good self tanner the smell is nice and not over powering and eventually i like light applications because it gives me a more natural look on my fair skin but i could see this being applied twice , once its completely dry if someone wants a more dramatic tan i used the corresponding mitt and it was really great for easy , fast application prior to my first application , i followed the directions to rinse out the mitt before application to avoid any byproduct that might have been on i thought this mitt was a , which would have dried quickly , but it is not and took way longer \( a few hours \) to dry completely i also like the color of the mitt , brown , because it will stain if it was a lighter color overall , xen tan transformation ultra weekly tan is a good self tanner it produces a nice color , is paraben free and contains cool ingredients like seed ! note , i make sure to exfoliate and apply lotion my dry areas like feet , heels , knees , elbows prior to applying this tanner for a better appearance
4	as a bar soap devotee i have been trying to switch to shower gel because it is better for dry skin but so far i have always back to soap because i feel cleaner i have used this shower oil on half of my body regularly for several days 1 it lathers like soap 2 after a tough sweaty workout i feel clean 3 it is gentle enough for all body parts 4 it is moisturizing but does not take the place of body lotion 5 it is not good for application when you are out of the shower , it feels soapy i actually got back in the shower to wash it off after applying to dry skin \( one star \) 6 it leaves no residue in the shower and does not create a slippery surface 7 the bottle is large and heavy so is not conducive to travel unless you put it in a travel size bottle 8 the pump works great 9 the portion of my body that i used the shower oil on better with a softer feeling after several days of a side by side comparison
5	what a fun and unique bright pink this color is thinner then the darker essie colors making it a lot smoother and easier to paint it 's not as neon as i thought it would be , however , it 's still a bright and fun color if you want true neon , i would recommend china glaze pink voltage instead
4	pretty good brush cleaner i use this a lot for my personal makeup , or when i have to do a quick spot clean in between clients only thing i will say is that it leaves a bit of an oily residue but i do n't mind also does have a lemon scent which i love
1	did not work as well as kits from other companies we have tried in the past
4	what a weird container after using it a few weeks i do n't mind it so much anymore but i do wonder why they made it this way i love the color and the matte feel of it my skin is not the but it still looks and pretty with this product i'm the type of person who gets shinny skin in no time this does not completely control it but i must say it will shine less longer also , my skin tends to brake out with some makeup so i'm always wary of new products , but it was fine with this one overall , i really like it it does not come with a brush to apply it so make sure you have one
5	love this conditioning shampoo leaves my hair light and bouncy but the price point is a killer ! if you want to spring for it , here are some things to consider this dispenses like very dense shaving cream and is very concentrated try a small amount first and this will last much longer than the same size and weight of liquid shampoo if money is no object , give this shampoo a try i will enjoy while it lasts
4	we went to a swim party last week and my wife too this along to give it the first go she said it goes on smoothly , smells good , she did n't get any sunburn all the things you 're looking for no heavy white coating on her face she wore minimal makeup on top of the sunscreen , but did n't mention that , i just saw it she did say it made her face slippery when she got wet , but no complaints about that overall she gave it an a
4	the coverage is very good however , i find that my sink has particles in it after i use it , and it does come off on my pillowcase however , it does wash out
3	this foundation is supposed to be hydrating and smooth with just a few colors available it was hard to tell which color would work best for me and i could not find shade swatches anywhere , and amazon pics only show one shade in all the different pics , so i ordered the sand color available to me , but when it arrived it is not a perfect match however , the next shade up seemed too dark i use several liquid foundations in the same price range and i am not very impressed with this one my favorites in this price range are mac studio fix fluid and mac , in shade nc30 or nc35 in summer they are more full coverage vs this foundation is very spreadable and more comparable to this one but i still think it gives better coverage as it hides my redness better than the la roche posay i also like clinique foundations , i use clinique even better glow foundation in nuetral or honey shade that has slight and lighter coverage than this foundation but better clinique silk in my shade vanilla is probably the closest with moderate coverage and easy , but it blends more easily than this foundation overall , given the price , i would give this one 3 stars
4	my wife has been using hand creams for a long and is constantly checking out new products she has a couple of tried true hand creams she uses depending on prices this product she like because it was non greasy , there was no detectable scent , and the hand cream absorbed very well as far as the aging claims , the jury is still out that takes more time than she has used it to tell over it is a good hand cream , yet the price is a little higher than she likes
4	i'm one of those people who ca n't do heavy makeup maybe i have a but any sort of weighty makeup makes me want to grab a washcloth and scrub this concealer works pretty well it 's better for dark circles than dark spots \( thanks to my husband for letting me use hi as a test subject \) with a little aid it covers rosacea i ca n't wear it everywhere because it 's a bit greasy and a bit heavy i can wear it on my cheeks but not under my eyes it 's just to heavy my teen , on the other hand , has no problems with the weight she goes to high school several times a week with full paint on this works perfectly to hide those little blemishes
4	i was apprehensive and a little nervous before receiving this skin smoothing laser i did a lot of research and most of the reviews i read said it was very painful i 've used an epilator on my face for years and that can be painful , so i wondered if this could actually hurt worse the laser arrived in a heavy box \( the laser and base are heavy \) , with a cord , a usb cable and very nice bag to put it all in before first trying it i read through the whole instruction manual \( written by an english speaking person \) to make sure i knew what to do i was still nervous to try it , but i tried it on my forearm first like is recommended in the manual to power on the device you need to press the power button 3 seconds \( if you only press a second you 'll get an error tone i know because i got a couple of them at first \) the laser pulse starts out at low \( to set it to high you push the power button \) so , it was set to low and i finally got up the to place the lens of the laser on my forearm i saw a blue light that meant it had delivered the pulse huh \? i did n't even feel it it counts the number of pulses on the device so i knew it had worked so i tried it on high on my forearm that i could feel but it was nothing like using an epilator or even a tweezer after that i got brave and tried it on my face \( make sure your face is clean and dry \) i only used the low setting the first time and i did n't do many pulses , only about 10 on each side of my mouth \( 40 in each zone is recommended and there 's 4 separate zones 2 on the side of the mouth and 2 around the eyes \) i could feel it on the low setting , but nothing compared to tearing my hair out by the roots via an epilator i did n't see any reddening in the area afterward , but i did put on some skin serum \( i have since seen some reddening of the skin \) there is a separate instruction sheet showing a website to a skin clinic to track your results they included a usb cable to do this , so i plugged it in and my computer the and then nothing so i went to the url and got this message welcome to the iluminage skin clinic thank you for your patience as we work to bring you a new , improved treatment experience stay tuned ! a device this expensive that comes with a usb cable only for the purpose of to the skin clinic website and it 's not working \( \( three weeks later i checked again and it 's still not working \) i read that there was a study of women between 35 and 55 and the majority of them could see a difference after using this sometimes in only two weeks but possibly not until 8 or 12 weeks when i read that i thought yikes ! i'm almost 65 so i wonder if this will really help me i guess only time will tell it 's a few days later and i have used this 5 times so far on my face and then took a break on the weekend , which is recommended the most annoying part is that you have to get the laser perfect before it will emit a pulse i think that may be why some people do n't think it works the second night i tried this it kept going off after 30 seconds because i was n't placing the laser correctly that night it took me over 1 2 an hour to finally get 40 pulses on each side i'm getting better because last night only took 10 minutes the second night i started putting the laser on high and i honestly ca n't tell much difference between the low and high \( when i'm posting this about 3 weeks later i can now do 40 pulses on each side in a couple minutes \) i know some people have written that it really hurts , but honestly to me even on high it does n't hurt near what an epilator does everybody 's pain threshold is different and i have a high pain threshold \( i was told by a dr after a at age 21 that i was the only adult patient he 'd ever had who did n't complain about the pain afterward \) plus i 've had headaches from a neck injury for close to 40 years now , so unfortunately pain is something i 've had to deal with does it work \? that remains to be seen i had planned on posting before and after photos , but between the time i started this review three weeks ago \( i save it in \) and posting it , my mom passed away \( so i will be the photos because if anything i think i may have added more wrinkles and need to start again from scratch
5	crucial moisture does a nice job of blending in skin and moisturizing
5	i 've been buying this brand and this cream for a decade , always works , does n't irritates your skin and moisturizes enough even during the winter
5	i ordered la roche posay new pigment serum , 1 01 fluid for the dark circles under my eyes my greatest issue it comes in a nice , long sleek bottle with a convenient pump it goes on light , and smooth a little goes a long way the fragrance if pleasant and it last for a surprisingly long time product description with continuous use pigmentclar serum and moisturizer help fight against underlying and existing dark spots as well as preventing their brand story recommended by more than 25 , 000 dermatologists worldwide , la roche posay offers unique skincare developed with dermatologists for every skin type to complement treatments and promote good skincare practices at home every day
3	i'm forever in search of the perfect blue this is getting there color wise , but the formula leaves a lot to be desired it 's thin and streaky , very sheer i wore it over white and it looks kind of terrible i 'll be changing my polish asap
5	as advertised and received quickly !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
2	made under my eyes very dry
5	great shampoo that leaves your hair smelling great and your scalp with the cool relaxing feel and smell of peppermint this shampoo gives you an experience that is both and physically satisfying
4	it seems the kids inherited my sensitive eyes , so we definitely were interested in the claim that these were less irritating than regular eyeliner as far as we can tell , they meet the criteria of less no irritation , but the applicator took a little getting used to
5	the actual polish is a little thicker than what i'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands i love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish ! you just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go do n't clump on a thick layer ! the polish itself does not peel or chip off easily it really adheres well to the nail bed and i'm very happy with the purchase
5	i love it ! heats up fast does a nice job my hair does n't get caught
4	really like color but does have some glitter in it and i did not know it did but looks pretty good !
2	i really like their shaving cream , but this was not my favorite it is pretty greasy and the tip always gets clogged every morning with a chunk of material from the past morning i would say look for something else
5	i into this as soon as it arrived i have had the worst itchy skin this year bioderma is a thick cream , no scent , it goes on smoothly and absorbs well my skin felt soft all day when i shower , there is a film washing off that 's some thick lotion i recommend for dry skin sufferers
4	this offers just coverage in areas that have out from sun in my naturally red hair my hair looks like it 's color for a few days after i use usually a week after treatment i notice it looks too blond again feels very soft after
5	i love this stuff ! it is definitely drying so be very careful if you have sensitive skin really is a miracle worker !
3	you ca n't argue with the price or the options for these i see this pretty frequently in salons , so decided to give it a go i was looking for bigger curls waves i ended up returning the first one i received because it did not heat up my replacement seems better , though it still does n't seem to get as hot as it says it will overall it does curls pretty well my hair is straight and fine and really resists being curled , so using this they often fall out the construction is good , though the temperature knob feels a little flimsy i have n't found anything better for the type of curls i want with this curling iron \( or the price \) , but i feel my t3 wand does a better job of producing curls that stay
5	people just keep giving me compliments , and i'm not going to lie i love it
4	when you find your skin dull and lifeless , pull out this handy little piece of makeup , which will brighten and lighten the skin around the eyes recommended !
3	while it 's definitely small , sharp and convenient these clippers are a bit awkward and are n't as comfortable to use as a regular set of clippers on top of being a bit awkward to use they are difficult to get under shorter fingernails i 've been trying to use these for over a week now and i just cant seem to get comfortable with them to be fair i keep my nails short , like really short i play guitar , do a lot of writing and have a bad habit of if my nails if i feel them catch on anything because of that i keep them a lot shorter than most and find that i just cant get a good trim with these clippers i do feel like if you had slightly longer nails , like those that stick out to the tips of your fingers or just shy of , you would probably like these clippers again they are sharp , very sharp and they are really slim which makes them easy to carry around in a pocket or a wallet they are just slightly thicker than your standard house key , a little over 2 1 4 inches long and about 1 2 inch wide i will definitely be packing them when camping and taking short trips but i still prefer a standard set of nail clippers to these
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
3	this product seems to have a beneficial effect to the facial skin around the eyes it moisturizes , but i cannot discern an apparent reduction in puffiness or lines during the week i have been using it i trust it is working to some extent it has a flowery fragrance to it \( very feminine \) that is unappealing to me and irritable to my eyes this does not linger long however , it is enough for me to avoid this product in favor of a fragrance free option this is also a small quantity however , it seems priced on par with the other similar products in this
4	this product is really good for travel because it does n't count as a liquid and you can pack it in the regular part of the suitcase , thus up the small bag with liquids for carry on luggage the tinted foundation goes on easily and has good coverage
4	just got this so ca n't say for sure if it will irritate but did wear well enough , used a little of this on my crease to help pop out the color on my blue green eyes very pigmented and soft i even used some on my lips and looked good there too , with a light touch
5	loved this nail polish ! such a pretty purple grey color not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either i love essie colors , especially purple and will continue buying them !
3	this is such a beautiful color goes on easily the downside is that it chips quite easily maybe i put on my coats too thickly but they did chip after day 3
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	nice soft iridescent color very pretty understated color like it because it does n't show the nail growth line as much as darker polishes
4	love this stuff ! after just one use my skin looks less shockingly pale only negative to me is that i do n't love the smell
5	i have fine thinning hair i used two other products before trying toppik hair building fibers i used a color spray aerosol and a brush on powder i did n't care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes the brush on powder does work for small areas , but my hair continued to thin and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp this powder was suggested by a sales clerk at a beauty supply store it seemed to work better and was easier to use if i had a choice , i would like not to use any product , but i do n't want my scalp showing so i am very happy to have a product like this i started purchasing from amazon and found the product more reasonably priced amazon also has a pump that screws onto the toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most i use a little hair spray to help hold it in place i found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights i would be lost without this product one negative i do n't think can be avoided , is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots , but the alternative would be the appearance of thinning hair i order the refills and re use my container
4	i like how this deodorant stick smells ! it 's a decidedly masculine scent i kept sniffing it to see if i could come up with a description , but other than it reminding me a little of polo \( by ralph lauren \) , i could n't think of anything i came back here to read the description citrus fruits , pink grapefruit , geranium \? , that does n't sound very desirable , but do n't be put off physically , the stick is wide and the deodorant is clear and goes on smoothly works well to control odor note that this is a deodorant and not an anti antiperspirant good if you have kidney disease or are concerned about the ingredients in anti antiperspirants , less good if you do n't like damp underarms when you perspire at 20 it 's a little pricey , but overall a nice product
2	started loosing bristles almost immediately
2	i was excited to try this fresh and youthful scent i like light fragrances , not anything heavy and overpowering this was awful like a big jar of cheap , old lady perfume very sweet , but not young at all the bottle is pretty , though !
3	takes a minute to get the hang of it , but it does seem to work those thinning areas do get blended away but i honestly do n't feel it 's worth what the company sells it for little too much hype for actual performance
5	i love this cream i wash my face before bed and put on the cream and wake up with such soft skin great for anytime especially when the heat is on in the winter this cream puts the moisture right back in your skin not greasy feeling and completely absorbs into the skin a bottle lasts about 6 months i love it to use on my neck to keep it nice and soft and wrinkle free odor free for sensitive skin mario badescu makes great skin care products i love most of them i would suggest this to anyone who wants softer skin
5	as someone who suffers with dry sensitive hands \( especially in the colder months \) , i adore this soap verbena scent is so heavenly to me and have also tried lavender , and i continue to re purchase in verbena for that uplifting and light lemony clean scent when i cook a ton , i rather walk out of the kitchen to use this soap than the dishwasher fluid , because i know this one will not leave my hands red or itchy after multiple washes i love that it 's a simple formula that is free of much of the synthetic extras used on the lower end soaps i 'd used in the past the bar at 8 8 oz is surely a larger one , and just about fits in our soap dish to wall , as well as the one in bathtub l'occitane also carries a variety one if this large size does n't fit your soap holder
2	i have fair , sensitive skin and this product , while light and absorbent , also irritated my skin it tingled burned when i initially applied it so i stopped using it after about a week i usually do n't have trouble with high quality skin products but this one just was n't comfortable it absorbs well and is a lightweight cream with little to no scent but just not for my sensitive skin
5	i was wary of ordering this , since so many hair products are over scented or have a scent i just do n't like \( i e they usually smell cheap \) i was pleasantly surprised by this one it is perfumed , but not heavily , and it makes my wavy curly frizzy hair much more manageable i love it this is one product i plan to keep on buying recommended
5	bought this buffering lotion after purchasing the drying lotion and having great success i alternate them nightly there is a complete difference in my skin after 2 weeks ! no longer getting regular breakouts on my chin and my skin looks markedly clearer i use the drying lotion on any bumps that start to appear and they are literally gone in a day i alternate every other night with the buffering lotion to keep the area clear and bacteria free my chin has given me problems for years due to hormonal breakouts and this line has been a miracle help !
5	i do n't know why i keep buying this but i'm on my 3rd bottle it feels like a spa , especially if you work on the computer and your eyes start to hurt you live in a climate that leaves your skin feeling gross and you want to treat yourself to something refreshing this is a great stimulating feeling and i do actually notice my skin looking better !
3	the nail polish is high quality , and a very pretty colour , but is intended as part of a three step manicure since i do not have the nail hardener , or the , i cannot vouch for the effectiveness of the process however , considering the price of the items , this is quite an expensive trio one may as well go to a salon
5	some people have commented that the polish was watery , not the case with the one i got i bought it as a back up for my pedicure in case i chip i can do a touch up worked just fine
5	keeps my skin clear in the winter i cannot use it without following up with moisturizer but that could also be my sensitive skin type
5	this works fine for me , but do bear in mind that this is a deodorant and does not claim to be an antiperspirant if you perspire a lot , and most of us do in certain situations , then do n't use this product in those circumstances
2	love opi nail polish this color did not work out for me i was hoping for a sheer peachy pink i have tried applying it several times , with lots of shaking to blend every time i got a streaky look unless i applied enough coats to create an opaque look , which was then a bit too white and bright to flatter my pale skin tone
4	it 's a matt almost red color , i ended up adding my own glitter before the top coat as i like sparkly pearlized shades it 's a pretty color , just no character to it
5	purchasing dermablend products is purchasing quality these products have been a staple in my beauty regimen for years ca n't do without them also , this happens to be an authentic product
5	works great
4	this is definitely a night cream , ultra thick and hydrating i put this on at least an hour before i go to bed so that it has time to absorb into my skin rather than stain my pillow consistency is that of a very thick very light fragrance after working it into my skin , it feels softer , without my skin feeling greasy or tacky to the touch my skin gets so dry in winter , it becomes flaky this prevents the flakes , the itching and redness recommended
4	good wearability
5	beautiful sheer gold color applies smoothly opalescent , i love it ! the name is also fitting for the color very pretty
5	love this line ! !
4	kur by londontown works well , particularly for someone who does a lot of has hands in water , etc but still wants their nails to stay nice it is a very good base coat and does help the polish hold up simply by of using a basecoat alone , you can help the condition of your fingernails , since some nail polish ingredients can dry out nails i do n't read anything in the ingredient list that is really going to lend itself to conditioning the nail , or at least those ingredients are fairly far down the ingredient list not that i think kur is not helpful , but i think it 's value is as a quality basecoat , not a conditioner i would suggest periodic treatment with a nail moisturizer , or even good old olive oil , to help condition nails and the surrounding area the product odor is no worse than your typical nail polish product it does dry evenly and is very long lasting , and the polish absolutely holds up a little better than with store brand base coat
5	mom likes it
4	my face typically eats blush i 'll put it on in the morning and it 's gone before lunch i have found great success with the tarte 12 hour amazonian clay blushes which stay on until i take it off , but cream blushes have never worked for me in the past until jouer tint i got 10 hour wear from this as a blush and the color was soft and naturally pretty on my fair skin \( the color petal looks pinker in person than the picture on amazon , more like a muted rose color \) i was super impressed i applied it with a synthetic flat brush at first , which ended up being a little too heavy but when i took a clean kabuki brush over it , it blended out perfectly i did tap it on my lips as well and was happy that there was no discernible taste or scent i think it would be nice for a no makeup look on the lips , maybe more if i layered it as a brand , jouer has been hit or miss for me , but this tint is lovely it 's half the size of my jouer bronzer \( another big hit for me \) and the packaging design allowed me to connect the two products easily
4	i 've been using the clarisonic mia fit , this brush head works well with it this one is soft very similar to the one that was included when i purchase the mia fit it is gentle on my skin , i use it a few times a week i really love the clarisonic system i recommend it for clearer looking skin \)
5	love this shampoo ! dont have to use a lot to fully suds your head , smells great and cleans my hair without drying it out
5	pretty color ! love opi
5	great color ! goes on smooth , dries quickly and chips much less than similar brands !
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
5	a reorder for a friend that uses for a home business always pleased with it
1	did not curl my hair at all and i used it sometimes three times in the same spot this type of iron also does n't let you curl the very ends as you have to hold them with your fingers heats fast , has automatic shut off at least that 's in its favor , but for me , it did n't do anything but curl my ends i will just use rollers lot less heat damage and more curl i do like the fact this comes with a travel bag , but i do n't see myself taking it anywhere as it does not work not sure what i think of the glove found it
5	i am a middle aged woman whose age has only shown up so far on my eyelids this works it does not sting it does not irritate it soaks in to my skin right away and smooths the creepy part of my eyelids instantly i do n't know if i can continue to afford it but for now i am thrilled maybe the long term results will convince me for the next order and a tiny bit goes a long way
1	just no this is not how powder makeup should work , i have never bought a luxury face powder only for it to work worse than some drugstore ones ! it will sink into every inch of your face and even when used with her foundation it will make your face look cakes even if you apply a little ! not to mention it not stay long and eventually it melts off , which is odd because i have combination skin but my t zone still is n't very oily i just ca n't say anything i like about this product
5	i was concerned when it says it 's oriental fragrance because , depending on which part of the , i might or might not like it but , it turned out to be quite a pleasant composition and , as described , it is seductive the bottle is beautifully crafted matching the character of the fragrance darker top to lighter bottom , as if it is revealing making it a beautiful gift item the fragrance quality is also very high , long lasting , and as a first time user of calvin klein fragrance , i am very impressed i recommend it !
4	this oil is very similar to one my mom made in my childhood mixing rose hips oil and glycerin with a few other things to keep my skin moisturized and glowing in the winter we used no other moisturizer after our bath this absorbed so well in the skin and kept it glowing i am amazed that this is so expensive , as my mom used it as a whole body moisturizer on us , but this product has a higher concentration of the oil this oil does work well for my face and neck to eliminate dryness and has a great fragrance i can wear it under my moisturizer and makeup i just wish it was a bit cheaper , but a little goes a long way
2	i'm not sure whether it is the or the zinc oxide \( likely the latter \) , but i did n't like how this felt on my skin i 'd use this on a day when i was going to be out in the yard all day working because i think zinc oxide lasts longer than the chemical sun screens , but i wore it to work and really hated how my skin felt all day so i would n't do that again
4	a gentle , calming , moisturizer for skin that does n't contain clogging , parabens , or other major irritants a well oil water emulsion with lots of glycerin and simple yet effective emollients great for sensitive , reddened , dry ish skin that ca n't handle high levels of actives and acids do n't expect this to do anything except moisturize really well it does n't contain any wrinkle fighting actives , peptides , retinols , or enzymes dimethicone is the only silicone in the product , but it 's at super low levels , and this ingredient rarely causes breakouts it 's in many baby creams to help soothe the skin a dead to see a formula 's actives is to look for fragrance parfum in the ingredient listing this is normally no more than 3 4 , as anything higher would irritate delicate facial skin anything after parfum is in smaller and smaller therefore , seeing that the plant and botanical oils come after the fragrance , they exist in the formula , albeit in very small amounts however , certain plant extracts are at small levels at the very least , the plant based ingredients are soothing and calming to the skin yet even without these extracts , the base formula of the cream itself does a fine job of hydration and moisturizing with little irritation similarly composed creams exist from lush , l'occitane , organic pharmacy , most natural brands that you 'd find in health food or stores this is a good option if you need a sensitive skin hydrating cream that soothes and calms i am a huge fan of nuxe and though i this cream as above average , i actually love the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href nuxe body 24hr moisturizing body lotion 6 7 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 nuxe body 24hr moisturizing body lotion , 6 7 fl oz a nbsp even more it 's my holy grail lotion it performs above and beyond for a body lotion
5	this product came on time and was in perfect condition this color is great and can be worn any time of the year even though it is bright !
5	i love the fragrance it 's light and refreshing with a hint of rose fragrance combined with a touch of something else \( honey \) \? and it smells really expensive
3	first off , let me say that i absolutely love this bottle ! spraying out of an apple stem is just fun for some reason the parfum of lolita , however , is not a favorite of mine all i seem to ever smell is black licorice when i spray this , which is cool at first but then starts to give me a kind of headache i bought the 1 oz bottle which is great to have in my perfume collection , but i do n't spray this too often and would never buy it again
5	i bought a bunch of cnd polishes and most were awful however , this is an excellent top coat ! try it with opi polishes
3	i gave this product 3 because this product is just ok i have a very thick hair and i can use other conditioners that pretty much do the same thing i also do not like the lid when you are in the shower its very difficult to open it when you have a running water it should have been in the tube
3	i really like japonesque eyelash curlers and so i got this thinking it 'd work like the rest , only it 'd be purse size it 's not as good it 's ok
4	i do n't know if i look any younger after using this , but my face feels great and its a nice soothing buzz to wash my face and use this my two i wish it had a charging base because i do n't like loose charging around my bathroom and i wish you could adjust the strength of the vibration during use right now you press then the start button
5	love this polish this is my second bottle and it is perfect it arrived very fast and has been worn several times on my fingers and toes
5	another great color from opi , girl friend loves it
4	pretty color
4	my initial reaction to this base was one of doubt when this is called water canvas , there is no lie , for i felt i was merely on my face a substance with only slightly more body than water thinking to myself is this actually going to make any sort of base or just mix in with my moisturizer \? well , it works \( and i 've tried it with several foundations \) my foundations go on smoother and last significantly longer and i just love the sheerness this is weightless , comfortable , and leaves my skin feeling great my one complaint which may be more a lack of make up skill on my part is that i felt i needed more than a pearl sized drop to get the great results
5	i have tiny straight lashes and this works so well like nothing i have used before
5	i 've been wary of trying facial oils because i thought oil would cause breakouts but i 've been hearing more about how beneficial facial oils are so i decided to jump in and try one it 's great ! i actually love the scent , it 's like an expensive perfume and the texture is silky and does n't feel heavy no breakouts so far i love all of the nutrition that my skin is absorbing with this oil the bottle is small but you do n't need a lot , only a few drops depending on how dry your skin is it blends right in to my skin the dropper is easy to use too it will be easy to throw this in my makeup case for travel i would recommend trying this if you 've been on the fence about facial oils !
5	i have sensitive skin with occasional eczema outbreaks when my skin comes into contact with harsh cosmetics a lot of facial cleansers and makeup removers leave my skin either irritated or so oily that it reacts not this vichy it contains no alcohol , yet feels as refreshing as a traditional astringent without the drying my skin feels both soft and clean afterward i love that i can use it around my eyes without its an eczema outbreak i apply this cleanser using flat cotton rounds that way , i can minimize the fibers on my face and around my eyes i do n't have to rub the dirt comes right off with a swipe this is soooo much better than the l'oreal micellar water cleanser i 've used in the past debbie lee wesselmann
5	when i sprayed this on my expensive makeup brush \( 30 brush \) a data hook product link linked class a link normal href professional kabuki makeup brush with big angled flat top for liquid cream mineral powder foundation face cosmetics best quality design carrying case e book included dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 professional kabuki makeup brush with big angled flat top for liquid , cream mineral , powder foundation face cosmetics best quality design carrying case e book included a nbsp i was instantly worried as my finger started to sting and i realized there was alcohol in the product i grabbed the box and the first ingredient was alcohol more on that later in my review i had not cleaned this brush in probably a good month \( i know , terrible \) and i use this with compact makeup forever powder foundation nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href make up for ever pro finish multi use powder foundation 120 neutral ivory 0 35 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 make up for ever pro finish multi use powder foundation 120 neutral ivory 0 35 oz a nbsp so the foundation has been really packed down into the brush for some time i sprayed about 10 squirts of this product and had a white dish rag i had and begun gently rubbing side to side and the makeup began to come off i would check deep into the bristles each time until they were clean i had to do this about 5 times for this particular brush after the amount i soaked it with , the brush was dry as each time i would gently rub back and forth on the cloth the alcohol in the product helped with the of the drying next i went on to a big puffy avon brush i had which i use for blush this one is not nearly has caked in with product and i only had to do my 10 sprays and it was clean next i moved on to my eye shadow brushes , some of these i had to do two or three times and again , they came clean the heads of some of the brushes were white again fragrance the fragrance to the product is strong and if you are sensitive to smell would not recommend i personal love smells and did not mind it at all each of my brushes smelled wonderful the next morning when i used my brushes i could smell the strong perfume smell of the product on them it was lovely alcohol i had never used alcohol on my brushes before , so i went to my favorite search engine and was surprised to see many notes out there to disinfect your brushes in 99 alcohol honestly , this surprises me as i thought this would dry the bristles out overall very happy with this product i would not however use this as my sole brush cleaner and will continue to use the brush cleaner i have these will be nice for quick touchups or when i am traveling and want to be sure they are clean
4	these pads are great and help you clean your face completely and scrub a few rough spots but cost too much
5	i love this i mainly use it on my hands as they get so dry feeling in the winter since i have to wash my hands often you only need a little bit it goes on very smoothing and leaves my hands feeling better i put it on at night before bed i love the scent also it 's light but very nice
5	these curling irons are my favorites ! i love it !
5	good
5	this is a great cleanser that feels like it 's strong and does a great job without drying out the skin or doing any unnecessary damage a big fan of this product line and this has been another great addition
5	wife used this to cover her keloid and it works well , the bump becomes less noticeable and it covers well this is very easy to apply as well great product ! wife is very happy !
4	heat up time was very quick effectiveness of the plates , very good not sure i like the mist addition , kinda did n't use it as much as thought i would not sure why they added that little functionality the negative on this is that is a little heavier than the one i have and that seems to be the larger plate size , which is good if you have a lot of hair , mine is thinner now that i am older
5	love it ! ! !
3	unhappy with the size of this bottle for the price it seems to work decently well though , and has a nice scent i probably wo n't buy it again because it 's too pricey for the quantity that you get \( the powdered dry shampoo i buy from lush lasts 10x longer , for the same price \)
4	this is more of a rose pink kind of like bubblegum when you first open the wrapper ! i prefer a darker shade but this looks good on and for what it makes my lips feel like it was worth ordering i do n't think i 've ever had a lipstick that i put on at , drank coffee off and on and finally ate some late lunch still can feel the protection on my lips they 're soft and smooth and i have n't reapplied during the day i ca n't really notice that the color is still there but my lips feel coated and soft and smooth as i said i'm thinking all the colors may be a bit lighter than what they show up as online
5	received on time , works for my baby super moisture i will buy this again when i need another one thanks ! !
4	i ordered the brown shade have used the black one before the brown does n't have as much pigment as i wanted but it is great for a subtle natural look the product came unopened and it was not dried out thankfully ! it 's a safe buy !
4	i do n't curl my eyelashes daily , but when i do , ive used a shu eyelash curler for more than a decade now \( ive never worn fake eyelashes , so this was tested solely on natural lashes \) this georgie beauty model is very comparable , if a little less well made \( feels kind of and in my hand \) the big difference here is supposed to be the conditioning pads , which i did find softer than the rubber pads on the shu \( which ive replaced a few times in the curlers lifetime \) , which is likely gentler on lashes less likely to pull them out but it also made the curl less distinct because they do n't hold as tightly the georgie recommends curling the same way ive always done it hold once close to the lashes , release and then curl again closer to the ends the results are decent and the product easy to clean , but one thing that did n't seem to work as well as with the shu , probably due to the composition of the pads , is the old trick of briefly heating the eyelash curler with a hair dryer for a longer lasting curl this does come with two sets of replacement pads , which is nice , as the instructions replacement every three months of course that leaves one to wonder where youll find replacements , as they 're not \( at least not yet \) carried on amazon , and my local beauty supply store doesnt carry this product line otherwise , this is a decent curler , though im not sure the conditioning adds much beyond gentleness oh and , just fyi , always curl your lashes before applying mascara , not after , which is probably the best thing you can do to protect your lashes i will say that while i regularly wear very little makeup , one of the most noticeable differences i can make to my face at my age \( 40 \) , is curling my lashes and then putting on mascara it really does make a large , noticeable difference not something i take the time to do every day , but testing this product reminded me of
4	ordered a month ago color great to bad already had it ! ! ! !
5	i 've used foundation for many years i 've mostly used clinique because it 's rather reasonably priced works good but , now i 've found dermablend i love it ! i 've used several dermablend products i 've loved them all i have uneven skin tone age related wrinkles i 've found that dermablend works better for me than any other product i 've used before i will continue to use dermablend !
4	we have come to rely on the michelle phan palette 's this product provides and easy to travel with solution with the minor issue the brush does not fit in the case \( more on that below \) the palette construction is very good and it will withstand typical abuse , even in a household of girls the design \( about a little less than \) is very good in terms of usability and portability in a handbag however , functionally , they should have found a way to allow the brush to be stored inside the case for an even more comprehensive travel solution it is a shame because i found the brush of high quality , but likely to be lost since it cannot be stored inside the case the palette can be as needed with replacement colors , or even changed out for variation overall , we really like it except for the brush not fitting in the case
4	this foundation from la roche posay goes on nicely and leaves a sheer coverage i would n't use this during the but this is a great weekend option for me when i do n't want a heavy layer of foundation i use a light layer of this and use follow it with a light dusting of powder it lasts all day without breaking up and gives me a natural finish
3	this is an okay shampoo with a fantastic peppermint scent probably the best peppermint scent i 've found in a shampoo i ca n't say that it made my hair more shiny or manageable than any of the drugstore shampoos i normally use \( i normally rotate pantene with organics \) it did n't strip my hair , it did n't weigh it down , it did n't cause dandruff , it smelled terrific the mint provides a nice , brief tingle , which is great during summer months however , for less than half the price , i get the same results from drugstore shampoos , so i ca n't really justify using this again
5	i 've never tried any butter products other than nail polish , and needless to say , i am thrilled at the quality of both the bronzer and the clutch first of all , the clutch can be customized with other colors , tints , and powders the clutch has a nice sized mirror and closes firmly \( i say this because i 've had some compacts that pop open in my makeup bag ! \) though the bronzer that is included is supposed to be a contouring powder , i use it as an bronzer and it works just fine the shades can be blended in any number of ways get a bit of sun \? no problem with this compact , you can blend the shade that works for you i like that this gives my fair skin a more natural glow and not an orange y tone also , my skin is rather sensitive , and sometimes i have issues with harsher products this goes on very light and even and did not cause any irritation , so that 's a huge plus i'm looking forward to refill
5	works
5	i get my nails and toes painted once a month for good measure , but i'm beginning to keep a small essie collection at home , especially for touch ups when i do n't need to spend another 10 on a manicure , or when the manicure tends to chip a day or so after i have real nails , so this is not to offend those with gels , schalack or anything else but real nails just chip faster ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! great bargain and way cheaper than most retail outlet discount chains , including the shipping , if any at all my key west color ! ! \)
5	i saw this color at the salon and knew i had to have it i got a pedicure with it at the salon , and when i applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter , but i actually like it better like that i used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle
4	i like it a little gritty on my face but still nice and i have used it a few times
5	really like the color and the fact that it 's not as heavy as a lot of foundations , but still gives a little illusion does n't emphasize wrinkles , as some makeup can slightly higher spf is a good factor as well
5	i love this nail polish ! i apply one layer on top of a neutral color for a subtle but ever so fun sparkly effect
3	i have different skin depending on the season in winter , my face is dry when it starts getting warmer and humid , my face feels a little greasy i do n't wear a ton of make up but i do wear a pale shadow , a thin line of liner , and mascara most days i 've tried other brands of micellar water and it 's a given you need to hold the saturated pad over your eye make up longer with this one as well i do n't think this would take off heavy make up , but light eye make up , yes what i do n't like about this micellar water is it feels like it leaves a coating on my face , which i have to rinse off with regular water from the sink i like garnier more and it 's a little cheaper
1	this product doors nor work with vinylux polish also by cnd my nails fell apart with this gunk it took two months to grow my nails out so that i could wear polish again
5	no heavy perfumy smell 4 oz bottle comes out nice and is not hard to take with you easy cause the bottle is small i found this works for about two hours before having to apply more but i am a redhead with fair skin i like it alot
4	i had n't tried this particular cream before , but like the others i use \( skin strengthening complex , physical cleansing scrub \) , it is a fabulous product and leaves my skin feeling like velvet i also feel like these products help fight the aging effects of sun and environmental factors
5	i have never liked mens perfumes , except on my grandfather he always had a combination of spice and hair wax that was just the most wonderful scent in the world this reminds me of him i do n't know what it is exactly , but everywhere i spray it , i have that memory for everyone else , i like a nice smell fresh , clean , just out from the shower , is the perfect scent then they always mess it up by getting all sweaty nice , sometimes , but mostly , not it is hard to convince a teenager he should not smell like a womens magazine , especially when all his friends seems to be dipping their heads in one i showed him how i put scent on and him to try it i send a tiny spritz in the air in front of me and let it dissipate a little and then step into it he did n't like that , not at all apparently he prefers to spray it all over himself so he , too , can announce himself , five minutes before he walks into a room
5	this is really a nice treat for days when your skin feels really dry
3	this almond oil skin smoother works my skin seemed smoother and glowed a bit when i used it but the scent was way too strong for me it reminded me of my elderly aunt 's perfume
5	good
5	best shampoo ever ! you do n't need very much i wash my long hair every day and 1 bottle lasts almost 2 months
5	i have two problems one is really dry skin \( now that i'm older and tend to have low thyroid levels \) , and two , a lot of allergies thus i approached this shower gel slowly i found that it was really nice the scent is mild and it does not dry out my skin , so my skins softness and condition has definitely improved since i began using it the bottle is large and is you do n't need a ton of gel to get clean since it 's soap free there may not be the suds you are expecting , but it 's those suds that are damaging to the skin
4	fragrance free which is really great and feels nice and soothing on your skin , but this stuff takes forever to absorb an hour after i applied it my skin was still sticky
5	i bought this palette after watching a youtube makeup video \( by \) and it is by far my most used eyeshadow palette ! i love trying new things but keep coming back to this because the pigmentation is the same on the skin as it is in the palette something about these matte shades allows for beautifully lids ! i have the naked 2 and several small lancome palettes but is my favorite for a more dramatic look i might add a little shimmer to the brow bone or to top an all over color but during the day and for work this palette is enough thank you !
4	i like to use toner as part of my evening skin care routine it ensures that my cleanser has done its job and no traces of make up have been left behind this toner is alcohol free , non drying and pleasant to use theres a subtle fragrance nothing overpowering and it leaves my skin feeling soft there is no residual sticky feeling and im able to apply my night cream within a minute or two ive experienced no irritation , redness or breakouts my skin type is normal with a slightly oily t zone and this product does not leave my skin with that tight , dry feeling while i like this product very much , id pause before spending 18 \( current price \) on a toner its not that i think the price is outrageous \( it falls in the mid range \) , but toner is just not one of those skin care items that im likely to splurge on i have purchased alcohol free toners for half this price and been happy with the results in the end it all depends on your beauty budget its a nice product and if you 're not on a tight budget then definitely give it a try
5	boyfriend loved it i love it he smells great ca n't keep my hands off him
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	i have had the pleasure of trying ahava products in the past , specifically ahava dead sea water mineral hand cream , which i loved not too surprisingly , all of that cream is gone , and the opportunity to review a new product by ahava appeared the dead sea essentials witch hazel hand cream how would it compare \? well , ahava has done it again with another product i love the scent , i love the texture , i love the feeling not greasy at all , yet my hands feel smooth and moisturized it works fine with my psoriasis about the only problem is that this is a large container that cannot fit easily into a purse for ! ahava has knocked it out of the park twice i ca n't wait to try another of their products ! update 06 22 16 after using this product more and more , i have to take off a star while the product does seem to moisturize , it leaves my hands so greasy initially that i just find myself avoiding using it my sister likewise avoids it for the same reason it leaves hands incredibly greasy brought to you by c s light
3	i received only a small sample size of this that was good for just two uses , so i ca n't speak to its long term effects i can see , though , why it has such good reviews it 's a thick cream so is best for mature or really dry skin and leaves your skin feeling really hydrated and soft
5	this color is so pretty ! ! ! i saw it on pinterest and had to get it ! i is pretty light so i have to put on about 3 coats to get my ideal color , but i usually put on 2 coats of any color anyway just to get good coverage
5	ok
5	great color , one of my all time favorites of course i only buy opi color is same as picture which is n't always the case
4	really like color but does have some glitter in it and i did not know it did but looks pretty good !
5	i used this color today to do my first ever at home shellac manicure i'm not a professional , but prefer doing my own nails , so i recently purchased the cnd 6 bottle starter kit , a uv lamp , and an assortment of polish colors this color is so pretty ! i had to use 3 coats to get the coverage i wanted , but it turned out awesome it 's a deep purplish silver shimmer color i'm sure this will definately be one of my top 5 favorite colors
4	got this as a gift for someone and they loved it they said it lathered up great and smelled good too
5	nice sweet color ! !
4	my hair is dyed blonde and has been looking a bit over processed , dry and the color could be a bit shinier i used the product as advertised and have to say first of all , it lathers up nicely and has a pleasant , light scent it took a few times of using it , but i noticed after awhile , my hair started looking fresher and shinier and not as dry and over processed i have not tried the conditioner with it , but definitely notice a difference just from the shampoo and hope to see continuing improvement
5	great product
4	good polish
5	i have never tried a self tanning product before because i'm pretty medium skin tone naturally however , i received a sample of this in my amazon beauty box and i thought it was awesome ! ! the towel was enough to tan my thighs , back , stomach , chest , butt , and shoulders \( i was trying to tan places that do n't normally see the sun , to get rid of my funny tan lines \) the tan was subtle , but noticeable to me it got rid of my tan lines ! and it was awesome because it had no bad smell whatsoever and it did not feel sticky or gross and it did n't discolor any clothing or furniture or anything i might order these now , even though i really do n't usually self tan
5	this is a fantastic bb cream and imo is great as a foundation for mature skin \( i purchased mine for 13 99 from ebay , includes shipping \) mine is the light medium and provides a smooth , beautiful look i have found my holy grail ! and even though it 's a mousse , it 's not super airy so you really can use a small so you 're not paying for air
4	a body wash shampoo conditioner with a seriously manly scent ! the sweet tobacco scent is not subtle at all , especially when you lather up in the shower , but it smells good and it fades once you rinse off but stays with you in a subtler fashion throughout the day i can see the scent being , you either love it or hate it i like it , and so does my wife , so it works in my household this is rather expensive wash , at about twice the price i would normally pay for wash , but it is a large bottle and a little does go a long way i had no issues getting a good lather going , and i'm not sure why some other reviewers have reported low foam , as i get quite a lot of foam using a bath sponge the one thing i do n't quite like is that this wash leaves a kind of soft feeling on the skin , like a moisturizer , and i prefer not to have that feeling on the skin coming out of the shower but all in all , i like the stuff quite a bit !
4	works great for tight curls i prefer my conair curling irons though the handle is a little tight and squeaky compared to conair brand
5	this sea kelp body scrub is fantastic ! i got it for my husband but i 've been enjoying it as well the scent is subtle and refreshing , not overpowering at all and is not manly nor feminine so it 's perfect for us both i really like that it is gentle for my delicate skin and tough on rougher skin it leaves me feeling smooth and polished
5	amazing !
5	i would describe the color as a pink mauve color it transitions well from work to play next time i wear the color i 'll pair it with an effect color like zillionaire to give it a little pop so far i'm very pleased
4	each of these four brushes in their firmness it 's the softest one feeling silky soft in fact all of them have soft outer bristles the inner two bristles become firm the brushes are color from white to a deep brown or black the other two are tan and turquoise all the have a container with large holes to allow the brushes t , dry between uses there is a click when you put the brush in its case so you know its secure
5	i use this for a natural look love it ! shellac last for 2 weeks and no need to have nails done !
5	cool this is part of the hawaii collection but not in the sampler pack which i'm sorry i did n't skip this is pretty another pink purple combination , more matte finish on the darker side of pink , mauve perhaps nicely different
5	as a lingering side effect from past accutane use i have chronically dry skin accordingly , everything in my routine is all about hydrating and moisturizing my skin i use serums , oils , creams , and masks with this in mind , but during the day in the i still find that my skin feels occasionally dry and tight i love keeping this at my desk at work to spritz on my skin throughout the day when i notice it feeling parched it does a good job of instantly making my skin feel soothed without messing up my makeup i also quite like bringing it on beach vacations to spray on my face and chest when i feel like cooling off , but do n't want to jump into the water the only thing i will say about this product is the can is pretty huge , so i tend to keep it in one spot and use it there vs taking it with me wherever i go as i do my small , travel sized toners and spring water cans
5	this is a lovely , soft , buttery foundation that comes with an applicator tip so that you can dot the foundation on your face before blending it in it goes on quite smoothly and does n't settle into wrinkles as advertised , it is more of a tinted moisturizer than a makeup there is no perfume that i can detect , and this particular buff color seems a bit darker than the online photo i am very pale , but this foundation blended with my skin quite well \( i used it very sparingly \) , and lasted a good eight hours coverage is medium it blends but does not conceal blemishes and moles , but overall , it does even the skin tone nicely all in all , this is a great foundation for mature skin because it does not cake in wrinkles it does not cover completely , but it does leave an even , somewhat dewy finish , and it has a spf 20 sunscreen
4	the closest perfume i can think of that this reminds me of is cashmere mist , it is a very pretty light , powdery scent upon first applying but it changes to a more floral woodsy scent on me after about an hour perfume is such a personal preference type of item , it would be best to sample it first at a high end fragrance counter to see if it is one that you like love for me it is heavenly , a very feminine scent that i really , really like !
3	i was pretty underwhelmed by this set , although i wish i could rate the products individually i 've used cleansers , peels , and moisturizers from everyone from cetaphil , basis , and l'oreal to la mer , sk ii , and algenist , so i'm going to compare these products against the best \( and worst \) of that bunch cleanser disappointing not only does it not really foam , it also does n't remove makeup very well i could tell i still had residue on my face , but tested this with a cotton pad soaked in \( algenist \) toner sure enough , it came away with makeup on it it also does n't foam enough to work well with my clarisonic maybe i 've been spoiled by algenist 's cleanser , but this cleanser is only good for a light morning cleanse it 's sure not going to get benefit they 're real mascara off without a lot of serious rubbing \( if at all \) moisturizer fair it has a light , scent and color , and leaves a slight tingle on the skin the container is much bigger than it needs to be for the amount of product , so do n't expect as much as the picture shows the moisturizer absorbs quickly \( especially if you spend the suggested 30 seconds rubbing it in , which sure seemed like marketing to me \) , and does n't leave me greasy that said , it 's far too light for my combination skin in arid conditions i have to use a facial oil over top to make this even barely acceptable on the plus side , it did n't break me out but it also did n't have any dramatic brightening results , so i 'd just call it okay peel pretty basic aha peel pads the size and thickness were nice , and there was enough product on one pad to use this on my neck and decollete in addition to my face but this set only comes with five pads , and since you 're supposed to use it daily , it 's not really enough to do more than decide if you can tolerate them these do n't add much to the set other than give deluxe sample as far as peel pads go , i 'll probably go back to dr dennis gross or peter thomas roth , since i 've been happy with their results and price point overall , i find this to be an overpriced set of mediocre products i should also note that mine arrived with the cleanser leaking all over the inside of the box if you plan to give this as a gift , you might want to be prepared for a less than stellar presentation
5	love this neon summer collection , and the name says a lot peachy and light , perfect !
5	the thing about reviewing this is i wo n't get to review and share the final result photographs for many months unlike a previous silk'n hair removal device , this one does n't even hurt on level 5 it 's like a puff of air the gliding movement makes application so much i look forward to the results !
4	easy to apply eye liner the black color is dark and holds up for most of the day it does start to bleed a little by the end of the day but that is probably due to my skin getting more oily as the day progresses it goes on smoothly and does not snag at all the tip is able to create a very precise line and does not need to be sharpened o have been using it for 3 weeks and have n't sharpened it yet i have not had any issues with irritation , but i do not wear contacts or have particularly sensitive eyes i like this eye liner a lot and only knocked off one star for the bleed factor and because it is a bit pricier otherwise , it is a great eyeliner
5	glad i tried this , does not break me out !
5	love the color it is vibrant and does not chip receive many compliments
5	love the way this sunscreen feels and smells ! it does n't break my face out like others do or feel heavy !
5	my former hairdresser introduced me to this fantastic conditioner it has a light peppermint scent it 's a conditioner that can be used on my whole head of hair \( not just the ends \) without causing heaviness or greasy hair it costs a little more , but it 's a quality product i like to try different hair products , but always come back to this one highly recommended
4	this does a nice job minimizing lines and wrinkles it goes on smoothly it dispenses a bit too much in one pump because it is thin so be careful to dispense where it wo n't drip right off your fingers i gave it 4 stars because it is a bit too oily label states to apply moisturizer right after but you really need to give the serum some time to be absorbed this is not always convenient for me in the morning \( not so big a problem at night \)
5	i would compare this bronzer to nars , except without the shimmer just as dark very nice shade for olive complexions
4	problem straightening thick wavy hair needs straightening spray otherwise a good product i recommend for most types of hair unisex one of the best
5	she needed green nail polish and thought she might like the color i bought it she got it , and i'm surprised but uses it all the time she loves the color and i may have to buy another now totally worth it to see the expression on her face
4	this powder performs the main job i expect when it comes to a face powder it produces a more matte finish in oily areas of the face and helps to set foundation however , while the description speaks of blurring imperfections and silky color , i do n't really find that it provides much coverage or at least , i ca n't use enough to get coverage without looking chalky , though it 's fine if used with a light hand for this reason , i really prefer using a powder brush instead of the included flat sponge , which i also felt removed too much foundation since this powder has a tendency to look too pale on me \( my foundation color is usually light \) i 'd have reservations about recommending it for deeper skin tones unless you know from experience how translucent powder works for you the case is excellent attractive , sturdy and with a nice sized mirror though perhaps a bit difficult to open i have tended to prefer loose powder personally however , when i use this side by side with my own favorite shade of loose mineral powder i cannot tell any difference in the results it has n't won my brand , but it 's a decent pick
5	she needed green nail polish and thought she might like the color i bought it she got it , and i'm surprised but uses it all the time she loves the color and i may have to buy another now totally worth it to see the expression on her face
4	it 's difficult to review skin products since it 's subjective i liked this oil fine , but it 's really too heavy for my complexion since i have combination skin it leaves my skin feeling too oily , and i realize it 's a facial oil , but some leave your face feeling hydrated without the oil feel
3	over all it is good but i feel it kinda scratching my hair it does n't go as smooth as the titanium model i returned and get the same size with the titanium model
5	dave 's wife i had never bought pca on amazon before , so i was a little worried but the product was sealed , new , and legitimate i am very happy and will be buying again when i run out thank you
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	literally one of my top 5 polish colors of all time it 's a beautiful neutral , without being pink i rarely do the same manicure twice , but i have made exceptions for this \( and i add safety pin as an accent \) i will always suggest this as a perfect basic neutral that is a definite must have !
5	so happy i purchased this ! smells so good ! its the real thing
5	this solid setting powder was used by a friend who has beautiful olive colored skin with minor imperfections in conjunction with dermablend cover creme foundation she was attending an outside summer gathering in very warm conditions so was especially concerned her skin , which tends to be oily and prone to breakouts with some products , might appear shiny or makeup might run and need to be reapplied as the afternoon wore on she had never tried a setting powder before and was surprised that though the product is white it went on completely she applied it only once and buffed it with a makeup brush she said it has an effect of seeming to absorb any oils without any caking and still felt weightless this was a free product in exchange for a fair and honest review , but she reported that she will definitely now include it in her normal daily makeup routine and will purchase it when this sample supply is exhausted
5	the toppick hair building fibers fill in the thinning areas on my scalp it looks very natural , and others comment that my hair looks
4	love this stuff ! unfortunately does not contain fluoride though
5	for a foundation and brush \? crazy , right \? well , maybe not so crazy when i opened the brush , i thought , what , this tiny thing \? it 's going to take forever to put my foundation on but the foundation went on really quickly , almost as quickly as my big puffy brush i usually use with loose powder i buy high quality brushes as a rule , but i love this brush even more than my normal one and will be using it from now on i am surprised that this foundation is described as a cream , as it looks and applies like a powder i tried it on bare skin , on half my face my teenaged daughter immediately pointed to that side of my face and said , that side looks better and younger i was surprised at the younger comment then she asked if that was the side that has the makeup on it is that light , that you can hardly tell that you are wearing it other than that you look better i put some on her and she loved it too she has extremely sensitive skin and so far has had no issues i agreed to let her wear it on special occasions hey , age has its , like in top of the line makeup like portable loose powder makeups , you open the compact to reveal a thin second cover with holes in it however , you do n't twist it , put the lid back on , shake it and remove the lid to get to the powder , as with other compacts i have owned you merely twist it , and similar to a clicking lip gloss applicator , a small amount of powder is on top kinda cool one side is light and the other is dark the first time i applied it i swirled it all together and was surprised when it turned out a little too light , even for my fair skin it is very easy to custom blend right there in the container , getting the proper amount of light and dark to customize to your skin tone whatever is left over \( light or dark \) is perfect for highlighting or contouring this sounds complicated but it really is not and takes only a fraction of a second of thought and no i was surprised at just how much i like this powder and will continue to buy it hopefully by the time i run out , amazon will sell the powder separately from the brush
5	perfect pink ! this nail polish also does n't seem to dry out as fast as others
4	im not a big fan of soap and prefer a shower gel however , most of the shower gels out there for men have a strong , overpowering scent and leave a slight film ive used old spice gels for a long time and generally like them in spite of the i enjoyed the chance to try out philosophy for men amen shower gel i actually really like it first of all , the scent is spicy masculine \( e g non fruity \) , yet subtle it doesnt overpower you like the axe or old spice brands typically do however , although its subtle overall , others will still notice your \( nice \) smell the texture is thick and it applies a lot like lotion i have dry skin during the winter and its very helpful in keeping my skin hydrated but , if you do n't like your body wash feeling like lotion , its a downside i love the smell and how it keeps my dry skin at bay know what i do n't like \? the price its way , way too high for a shower gel heck , even cutting the price in half would be too much but , if you have extra cash to burn , this is a really great shower gel
5	i occasionally use theater makeup in order to get the coverage i need unfortunately it is usually very heavy and greasy , making me break out this product provides excellent coverage after applying rather heavily , there was some slight stickiness but that disappeared within 15 minutes the photograph shows how much it took to do my entire face and neck , remembering that i applied it heavily the second photograph shows how it will not cover up a large , raised , nothing will , but color wise it made it a lot less noticeable sometimes i use a setting powder , sometimes not nice to know that it also has a high spf
5	wow ! beautiful color deep color but with a sheen that shows more than just a simple violet color so worth the crazy 15 for nail color i wo n't use the many nail color brands with all the un healthy in most products what is that about \? why risk more chemicals that darn sure ca n't be good to put on your body not with a beautiful alternative
5	i guess this is especially intended for women , but as an old guy , i find this a refreshing way to start the day it 's cool and refreshing on my face there 's no overpowering scent and that 's fine with me highly recommended
5	awesome product fast shipping thank you ! ! !
4	the japonesque velvet touch finishing powder is light and silky and gives my face a polished , matte finish the powder is very fine and delicate and does n't settle into the small lines under my eyes a problem i have with the mineral powder i had been using this powder is best applied sparingly and with a light touch i have a pale complexion and did n't need to use a lot too much gave me a washed out look it took a few attempts to find just the right amount to use , but once i did , i was able to achieves a translucent look i use a big fluffy brush rather than the sponge applicator which comes with the compact the sponge tends to apply the powder a little too heavily for me , however it works well for touch ups on oily areas later in the day the powder comes in a very pretty compact case with a large mirror the case closes tightly which at first was annoying , but later i appreciated that it stays firmly closed when carried in my purse or bag
5	i do n't like to wash my hair everyday , this helps cut grease , increase softness and volume smells good too just do n't wear dark clothes when applying
5	i love vita liberata , it 's very similar to st tropez mousse but without the smell i like self tanners with the tint for instant bronze color and you can see where it was applied i have no idea while they even advertise 2 3 week lasting period , as we shed skin everyday , but it last good 4 days cons price and size pros healthy skin with tan without uv damage worth investing !
4	i like this eyeliner a lot the reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars was because it did not go on very smooth i dotted and then filled in , which i know many folks do this anyway it does n't smudge or chip , comes off really well with eye makeup remover recommend this
5	the best face wash i have ever found , seriously very gentle and mild does n't dry face my skin feels refreshed every time i use it it 's a great day to start the day buy this !
5	this is the first time i have used this polish and really like it would buy again stays on long
4	good hold , washes out easily if applied to wet hair , it leaves a nice \( not greasy \) shine to hair holds most the day for me , and my hair is on the fine side , and length is average male short hair i'm not crazy about the smell it 's very sweet , and fruity think colada the good news is scent fades fast i prefer the scents of , and x \( pink container \) over this has a more masculine aqua cologne scent , and x has a fresh clean scent also similar to layrite , but layrite with it 's vanilla candle scent is my least favorite
5	this is an incredible product ! i put it on every night and the next day , my eyes are not puffy and it 's firm i look forward to putting it on every single night ! i use the ceramide eye gel for the mornings \( i place mine in the fridge for a quick coolness sensation \) i love all his products i definitely will be ordering in again and the rest
5	wow , this stuff smells fantastic i expected a spicy old school smell , but was pleasantly surprised at how good this smelled smelled like a modern clean cologne a little goes a very long way , foamed up great , took a hot shower , shaved down , then a 2nd round up both shaves were smooth , blades glided across my skin perfectly could n't ask for more in a shave cream
4	it 's as described a dark grey looks nice in the light because of the light shimmer it has two coats does the trick not a thick formula
5	absolutely amazing product i 've long used the hourglass primer , but this is great on my dry cheeks and undereyes no greasy feel , but just very soothing somehow it does minimize the look of pores and fine lines and it does not have the heavy occlusive texture of some silicone primers i have sensitive combo skin and i 've had no irritation or breakouts from this it 's my new favourite product it 's also helped my foundation and blush stay put for an entire workday in high humidity
5	this product is great for covering up anything from acne scars to tattoos you do n't need much to apply and it pretty much glides onto your skin i use a beauty blender , i feel like it 's a bit too thick for brush application i 've worn it in really hot weather and it held up really well , stayed blended onto my skin \( face and chest \) without needing re application or smearing everywhere the price is high , but this is one of those products that is well worth the money if you need serious cover up that 'll be reliable then i highly recommend this one , especially since just a little bit goes a very long way
3	almost white in color
5	great night lotion , makes my skin feel very soft and smooth
4	i really liked this conditioner overall although not as much as my normal deep conditioner that i get at costco my hair was easy to comb through \( and it 's usually very full of tangles \) and felt soft i live in a dry climate so conditioner is a must i got this product for free and after seeing the price of it on amazon \( at review time 49 \) , i 'll tell you i probably would n't buy it due to the cost since my normal conditioner is under 20 for a big bottle and does a slightly better job if you have heavily dry or damaged hair , you might have a better experience and find the product value better if this were around 20 , i would say it would be a great value maybe i'm just too frugal it 's a great product
5	this thick clay mask and softens the skin my daughter has acne and i have dull skin every so often and we both have from using it smear on and let sit for 5 min then wash skin will look clean and soft after one use the scent is too strong for my preference but will continue to use it because i like the way my skin feels after this is recommended for oily to normal skin , since clay could be too drying for some i did n't find it drying at all but i have somewhat oily skin my daughter had some red pimples that actually were less inflamed after she used the mask i will make her use it at least once a week from now on !
5	my wife used this product she prefers the mens line as the scent is stronger and lasts longer than the womens line lives up to the burberry name wonderful scent , tons of lather , and scent lingers for quite a while after the shower highly recommend this product
5	great
5	my favorite juice beauty cleanser great for my sensitive skin and removes makeup very well it has a clean , light , smell perfect for all skin types
5	have used many obagi products in the past but this is my first time to try this therapeutic moisturizer i chose this product because during harsh winter is the midwest i i live in chicago \) , it is very important to keep skin moisturized and protected so let me explain why four starts for the product this 1 7 oz of product contains glycerin 20 \( skin protectant \) as an active ingredient inactive ingredients include allantoin , corn starch modified and a wide variety of parabens that 's right it is when i see parabens on the ingredients list that i get turned off for a moment i generally try to avoid parabens in any form whenever possible however , i must say i really like this product on my skin if i had to compare it with any other products available i would compare it with neutrogena 's hand cream this moisturizer is much lighter than mentioned hand cream but the feeling of incredibly soft skin is just the same i use it in the morning on the days when weather is icy cold outside or when it is i layer it with skin protection spf cream product absorbs well and it is an excellent addition to my already existing collection of obagi skin care line products this product is good for any skin type
1	i so badly wanted to like this polish i am all about wearing pink in october , so i jumped all over this when cut blow offered a good deal on it and its companion polish , pink works imagine my disappointment when i tried to wear it last week this might be the worst formula polish i have ever worked with sheer but patchy , lots of dragging , and even after three thin , even \( well , as even as i could manage \) , there were still unevenly colored spots on my nails such a disappointment if you 're looking for a pretty pale pink shade keep looking ! !
5	excellent top coat goes on very smoothly and has a super glossy finish lasted about a week which , since i use my hands a lot , was wonderful i'm used to polish chipping within 3 days strong scent , but not overwhelming and the scent does fade quickly will happily continue to use !
4	this product says to massage 3 4 drops into the face and neck this oil leaves my skin silky smooth i have not noticed any improvement of saggy skin or lines as this product claims to do but it certainly feels nice enough to keep using unless there was is obvious improvement the price would keep me from purchasing again , but it does feel very nice
3	it turns out it 's quite dark after the second coat you can hardly say what shadow is it , looks just very dark
4	i do n't usually use eyelighter concealer it 's powder , mascara and lipstick lately , though , i 've noticed dark circles under my eyes as well as very fine crow 's feet i'm 48 years old with rosacea and some sun damage who lives in a hot and humid county has usually been enough i tried this and to my surprise , i liked it i usually wear nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href shiseido shiseido sheer refill natural light ivory dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 shiseido shiseido sheer refill natural light ivory a nbsp or a mary kay one \( right now i use mary kay beige 1 powder \) as a frame of reference for my color this shaded blended well and did n't settle in the fine lines around my outer eyes it 's not a miracle product to hide my dark circles completely but using this in conjunction with the powder and it did a pretty darn good job i up a mountain today and to my , sweaty surprise , my makeup held granted i used powder , this eyelighter and mascara but at no time did it sweat off i just washed my face and everything came off amazing
5	i'm in love with this polish ! its the perfect neon pink for summer and looks super hot with my tan ! people keep commenting on how much they love the color and want to know brand and color this could possibly be my new fav !
5	it 's important to know where reviews on products like these are coming from i'm 29 and a female who happens to enjoy wearing fragrances marketed towards males and females if it smells good on my skin , i will gladly wear it other fragrances i use are le male terrible \( for men \) , d g light blue \( for women \) , burberry brit summer \( for men \) , armani code \( for men \) , john varvatos vintage \( for men and my present favorite \) , ck euphoria \( for women \) and versace this is by far my favorite scent i think it 's a little to think that only a man or only a woman can wear a certain scent , if you like it , you should wear it ! that being said , this cologne makes me think of someone who is refined and neat and a bit of a sexy bad ass the entire life of this fragrance is amazing from opening notes to the dry down to the last little bit of fragrance that lingers at the end of the day the worst thing about it is that it only lasts about 3 or 4 hours on me i have been told that i leave my smell behind on other people 's clothes or their furniture , so maybe it just becomes undetectable to me at 3 or 4 hours also , the only people to ever compliment me on this product are people \( women \) that come within a foot or two of me this is fine as i do n't want to be the ass that is creating scent pollution in the office ! i have only purchased from retail stores , so i cannot speak to the service or product delivered by amazon but , if you 're looking for an original fragrance that is spicy and sweet but not too sweet , you should give this stuff a try ! the most noticeable notes all throughout are cinnamon , leather and vanilla words cannot express how much i love this juice !
4	this definitely gives full coverage but it does n't cover black tattoos on light skin completely i dabbed the stick onto my tattoo and i was still able to see a slight shadow of it this would probably do much better covering tattoos that are n't black i included a picture of the body stick being used , i slathered it on like it shows in the video i feel like the tattoo in the tutorial is more of a gray than a black , which probably would be easier to cover i tried building onto the stick but it just was n't enough , barely if it can cover my deeply tattoo as well as it does , i would think it could cover other less drastic blemishes i used it on my daughters arm which has scars from bug bites this covered that easily this feels heavy when used on the face i dabbed it all over them blended it in it looked fantastic , but if i was going to use dermablend for my face , i would go for the cover creme lighter feeling with similar coverage
5	typically the significant other and i agree with respect to most review items in the case of this matte lip mousse , we on , of all things , the color i love the color on her , and she does not she thinks the color is too bright sadly , i am the loser in this case the lip mousse went on easily and smoothly , forming a uniform layer across the lips while party lipsticks are often glossy , this lip mousse is a true matte finish , read non glossy however , i think the effect is beautiful , and i love the color the lipstick loves to stay on , to the of the significant other it took makeup remover to get the lipstick back off her lips after she decided she did not care for the color okay , we normally agree on review products , but in this case , it was a split decision however , since i actually write the reviews , i get to say what i want i love this lipstick i liked the way it went on the significant other 's lips , and they way it looked on her now , if i could only convince her to wear it again enjoy !
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
5	i love the pca creamy cleanser , i use this first and then the facial wash 2nd i'm over 50 and it does n't dry out my skin leaves it feeling clean and moisturized
5	nice fall color
5	while i found the name of this product as it sounded like a construction item , it provides an excellent foundation base and seriously lessened the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and lips laura geller is a name i trust in cosmetics and has a fine reputation for quality i highly recommend this base even though i did n't think id like applying spackle to my face
5	love the color
5	baby love , simply the best moisturizer out there i have very oily acne prone skin and i recently started using retinols irritated and inflamed my skin i ordered the avene skin recovery after much research and selected next day delivery because my skin was on fire from the retinol product well my product did not arrive the next day but , when it arrived i ripped the package open and smoothed it on my face and then it happen , baby love ! immediately my skin calmed down the fire was out and the moisture was superb not greasy just moist i love it
5	i love the feel of this cream it lasts a long time and i think my neck looks a little firmer at my age , i'm not expecting a miracle ! i think this is a quality product and i would order it again
4	excellent soap not as good as the germany nivea cream in a tube , but good nonetheless i apply some to each cheek , but lather up with a nice hot , wet brush works very well for me \( lathering in the tub is a bit messy for my tastes \)
4	this item was given to me for my review the jouer moisturizing lip gloss is a very pretty sheer petal pink color that is , thankfully , any shine comes from the gloss itself i find the color is perfect for summer and very natural looking for those of us who are graying , and perhaps lost some color in our face , as well , it is a good choice of color to add that youthful blush for young ladies , it is a nice , natural color that would look very nice if you want to have a pretty mouth , but not go overboard like when you are playing up your eyes so , color wise , i find this to be perfect for pasty little me the point off is in the rather oily texture the gloss is moisturizing , and my lips felt nice even after it had worn off , but i was n't as fond of the oiliness i will enjoy the tube i have now , and i might purchase again if i need a gloss , but i would like to find this very same color in a lipstick , i think
5	this really does disguise thinning hair i am a female with thin hair due to medication this keeps my part from looking too wide looks normal natural
5	tizo 2 non tinted facial mineral sunscreen spf 40 is a very good mineral sun screen and long lasting at the beach even if you go swimming several times it stays smooth on the skin without oiliness or stickiness i recommend it !
5	a friend i worked with who was in her 40 's told me about strivectin a couple years ago and i did give it a try but do n't remember why i stopped using it i bought the eye cream and the matching face cream recently because i just turned 31 and noticed my skin looking dull and older and wrinkles starting to appear around my eyes i 've got to say , i really like both products the eye cream goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin really quickly i 've noticed a big change in the feel and look of my skin since using these products and will continue to use them no decrease in wrinkles yet but i'm really just hoping to increase the quality of my skin so i look better as i age
5	i first started using this product after my partner gave up on it after noticing increased acne problems and breakouts but only used the product for about a week before giving up so , not wanting to waste about 60 i decided i would give it a try i also noticed increased and a general oiliness to my skin after about the first 3 days of use however , this all changed as i stuck with the routine and by day 9 my skin cleared up and looked better than ever i figure you just have to let your skin get used to the serum and let it work its magic my skin is looking good and clear and is no longer as oily as it was during the first few days of use looking forward to seeing how well jack black protein serum can continue to improve my skin also , the smell is very fresh and goes away rather quickly
5	top coat top coat goes on good this is my first time using vinylux so far so good just happy to not having stick my and in no more thanks jan you 're awesome \) \) \) \) \)
5	love this color , and love that opi finally added color to nail envy this was a perfect color to start with , too !
3	great product ! ! ! too bad they only fill it up half way
5	i have been using tretinoin \( retin a \) products at night for years my skin is not easily irritated , and i have had no negative reaction to the skinmedica retinol , not a surprise , since retinol is weaker than its prescription counterparts i am in general a fan of skinmedica , as their products seem well formulated and effective , although the dispensers do n't always last as long as the contents \( tns essential serum i'm talking about you \) i note that there are negative reviews on amazon from people who bought the retinol from third party sellers and received a knockoff or expired product amazon itself does appear to be a legitimate vendor \( check skinmedica for current status \) and is selling the retinol product at list price i 've been using this bottle for a few weeks , like the way it feels and the effect on my skin , and plan to when it runs out
4	i have been very impressed with this skin care kit there is enough of each item to test them thoroughly i also love the fact that this come with a day and night moisturizer the moisturizers and the serum go on smooth , but do not feel greasy or heavy the cleanser is perfect for an everyday cleanser and does not seem to clog pores
5	i love it !
4	the box and bottle are with the signature burberry pattern the bottle is very stylish the scent is just a tad strong for my taste it 's a little on the spicy side smells earthy a small amount goes a long way
4	i have been using the juice green apple peel for 5 or more years and i swear by it if you have sensitive , acne prone and rosacea prone skin this peel is wonderful the clear skin kit is perfect for other juice products or having travel sized products i am equally in love with the cleanser finding it gentle yet treating i am not impressed with the moisturizer , it feels a bit sticky and irritates my sensitive skin i do like the blemish clearing lotion but i only apply it every other day because \( again \) sensitive skin ! !
2	while the eye cream is nice , very smooth , non irritating , and sinks into my eye area without being too oily or heavy the dispenser leaves a lot to be desired such as , consistent usable sometimes i press the dispenser and just enough comes out , and application with the applicator wand is easy other times it shoots a ton that goes all over then there are times that it seems all up when it works it 's alright , though i 've stopped using the applicator wand in favor of my fingertip for applying because i can feel it going on more even in less time than trying to maneuver the skinny tip applicator so good product , interesting design , just needs a little more work or a classic pump to get it off the ground for me
5	i have issues sometimes with dark half circles under my eyes i tried this in light and found it to be very effective in diffusing the darkness of that area , as well as hiding any spots i set it with bare minerals powder and i am good for the day i reapply lightly at night if going out here is the brand pitch and i agree ! powerful makeup for all dermatologist created high performance pigments , fragrance free , allergy tested , sensitive skin tested , non comedogenic
4	not bad for a 3 in 1 product i use it basically as a facial cleansing wash , for which it works well it 's a little thicker heavier feeling than my normal cleanser , but it does the job
5	i love this stila color balm lipstick so much that i have it in six different colors \( pink \) , \( soft peachy coral \) , elle \( pink coral \) , \( pink taupe \) , \( nude pink \) , and \( orange poppy \) what i love about it is that it truly feels like a cross between a balm and a lipstick like a balm , it feels moisturizing , and wearable , and does n't dry lips out or settle in lip lines it has a nice creamy texture but like a lipstick it 's more pigmented and gives noticeable color with a more opaque look as far as wear time goes , i get a few hours out of this , but i'm also tough on my lipstick i'm often drinking and eating a lot and my lips so under these conditions i do n't expect lipstick , gloss or balm to last an incredibly long time so for me , it seems on par to other lipsticks i 've tried as far as application goes , i agree that the shape of the bullet can be less than ideal if i'm in a hurry i still find i can do a good enough job at creating a defined lip look , but ideally i find myself applying it with a lip brush when i can i also happen to enjoy the scent of this balm it has a soft vanilla mint scent to me \( vs a strong , pure mint \) that i find really pleasant and enjoyable i have a sensitive nose for fragrance and sometimes added scents give me a headache , but i do n't get that with this product overall i really like it it 's a great go to lipstick for daily wear and i really enjoy all the colors i own
5	i am fair skinned and i love this stuff ! i wore this one day to a polo match and was in the direct sun for a few hours i burned everywhere but my face i had received a sample in a birchbox and after my polo match experience i went on amazon to purchase a full size it 's so easy to put some of this on and go out the door i do n't like wearing a lot of make up and feel like this protects my skin from the sun while making my skin look a little better
4	28 for 0 4 oz of product we can all agree we 're always on the search for the newest holy grail , right \? you can find me usually using elf 's concealers as i have been for years it takes me awhile to consider switching since i 've had some awful results with some of the higher end products is a brand i have not heard of before and when i received this product , i assumed it would be much more as much as i hate the price , the product does a good job of covering up my dark circles , blending in like butter and staying on all day of course i also put a thin layer of foundation on top and set it with a setting powder but i could go without the foundation and just set it with the powder and be fine \( remember to always set with a finishing powder to help products stay on longer \) ! so glad i gave this product a try while it wo n't be replacing my affordable everyday elf concealer i will be keeping this around for date nights and days when i'm expecting to be !
4	as odd as it may seem i need skin replenishing oils for my lower arms ive gotten lucky with my facial skin and the pool as dealt me a winning hand as far as dryness and wrinkles are concerned what is the sad tell for me is the thinning of the skin on my lower arms old lady skin for sure just like my mom , i now have bumps , bruises , peeling spots , discoloration and generally skin so thin that every bump leaves marks i was very impressed that with one weeks use of this vichy neovadiol elixir ive already seen improvement the product is made in france but the packaging has dual english so im assuming that the company both to the east and the west another oddity is that the directions are printed on the inside of the package you have to tear open the cardboard package to read how to use the product this is not a , just an observation the oil itself is thin and absorbs quickly it has a much understated , sweet aroma that will not conflict with your cologne it claims to replenish essential lipids that are lost in the post menopausal aging process i have seen visible evidence that my lower arms seem \( in a good way \)
2	i love bb creams so i was really excited to try this when i first got it , i was thinking , wow that 's really dark then i noticed on the back the color says latte does that mean they make more than one color \? did i get a dark color without thinking \? i was hesitant to try this because it was so dark but i figured , hey , i want to see if it will help my legs with some color and to hide any imperfections i have applying it with a makeup sponge was fairly easy it blended out really well but the color was just not me not to mention the makeup was rubbing off on my clothing the top of my white socks were covered i actually felt more self conscious going out with my legs covered in make up than i did with them just super white i have 3 bb creams at home so i did n't bother using this on my face because of the color
5	i have been using this nuface trinity facial trainer 3 to 4 times per week , for the last 3 weeks and i have seen a noticeable difference in the jowl area of my face the skin on my face is tighter , brighter and feels great several people have asked me if i had recently lost weight because my face was thinner i wonder if this would work on my beer belly \? i have also used the wrinkle attachment and the fine lines and crows feet are gradually diminishing i'm afraid to stop using this product because i'm worried that my skin will go back to the way it was before i do n't plan on stopping using nuface anytime so i should n't have anything to worry about i'm excited to see the results after a few months use the device is simple to use and it feels surprisingly good i like the tingling sensation it leaves on my face because it lets me know it 's working i highly recommend this product if you are a man or woman of a certain age who is noticing sagging skin , especially around the jowl area it truly works wonders i just wish i would have gotten this a few years earlier as i'm sure the results would be even more dramatic
4	nice product lighter than i was expecting for medium i am pretty fair and this worked pretty well without looking like wrong shade probably would have worked better for dark circles if had correct lighter shade , but i did like the more sheer cover of this that did n't look like i was wearing brush is nice as well
4	my wife loves this powder it really hides blemishes well the only downside is the price 30 ! but if that does n't bother you , then go for it !
2	this is a generous portion of a moisturizing product that includes both two kinds of cream and a clear gel component in terms of effectiveness , it is okay for plumping fine lines and making skin feel softer and smoother in a non greasy way however , in terms of anti aging effects , it is not as effective as l'oreal paris revitalift \( which is the best anti aging product that i 've tried so far due to its lightening and exfoliating effects \) at 1 3 the price it 's also not as good as l'occitane 's moisturizers in general \( which work better for very fine wrinkles around the eyes \) if you 're comparing to a product at a similar price point the contents look cool in the bottle , but the bottle itself feels very cheap with the silver tone plastic caps at 60 oz , i expect something that is better presented as well as more impressive in terms of performance the smell is also a very faintly chemical one with a whiff of some very faint perfume to mask it though you can only smell it when it is close to your nose this is n't a bad product , but , for the price point , it 's underwhelming both in terms of performance and look and feel
5	i love essie nail polish it is easy to apply goes on smoothly color is beautiful ! long lasting will buy more essie nail polish
5	this is lightweight and smells very clean ! i was scared at the size and that it would not last long or have a lot of coverage , i was wrong i applied this and let it sit on my face for a bit and that seemed to work the best after i rinsed it off and my face felt so clean ! i did not have to use a toner or astringent after , there was no residue left on my face if you are looking for a deep cleansing foam , this one is for you !
5	let it be known that i have never used an at home tanning product ever so my expectations were pretty low this tanning mousse goes on easily , smells great , and though it takes a few hours leaves a nice , subtle , natural looking tan i used it to help with my farmer tan lines i 've got from wearing t shirts outside so often , and it 's blending it right together ! because the tan is subtle , it will take a few applications to completely blend the pale with the real tan lines , but it will definitely get the job done without leaving my skin orange or smelling funky very impressed with the ease of use and the natural , subtle results of the product !
5	i never used to use sunblock on a regular basis , but since i'm getting older , i'm trying to take better care of my face this has the slightest tint to it , not even really noticeable that 's fine though , because i use it for a sunblock primer application the resveratrol in it is a great antioxidant for your skin i 've noticed that this also does n't sting when i start to sweat plays nice with makeup the price tag is a bit hefty , but a little goes a long way , and it is the only face you 'll get
5	great pads i normally purchase pads from my dermatologist will be using these ones from now on !
5	this is my new signature fall polish ! ! love this color ! it looks black , but in the light there is some shiny wine undertones
3	it 's great that amazon is picking up international beauty brands that are hard to get otherwise uslu airlines is a german brand that is best known for their airbrush makeup , and used to be hard to get in the us the thing with lipstick colors , though , is that because it 's not like you can run by sephora or ulta and test these brands before buying online , amazon needs to figure out a much better way to help customers choose cosmetics without fear of wasting money on the wrong shade this is a perfect example of the problem it really depends on what monitor or display you 're using as to how the shade appears on your screen moreover , it depends on how accurate the color correction was on the original photo i checked out uslu 's website , and their images were no more helpful when it first arrived , the aal shade in the tube looked nothing like either of the photos shown here it was a cooler pink that , try as i might , i could n't get an accurate photo of , even using a light box i may try taking another photo in natural light later nevertheless , the image shade here looks different on different screens in my house on some , it looks more accurate on others , it looks nothing like the actual product \( in a perfect online cosmetics world , companies would include a few different shots of the actual product on actual lips for each color ! \) however , i 'll do my best to describe the shade when you put it on this is a sheer color , but is the sheer i 've ever tested it goes on with almost a gloss moisturizer feel , yet deposits more opaque , high value color w more white in it peach pigments in the grooves of your skin in a very weird looking way not pretty uslu 's lipstick is meant to be somewhat sheer with a single application , but with the potential to be built up by applied layers to a more pigmented , dense look in the case of this shade , though , that single layer does not work for a sheer look \( unless you just want to use it more as a tinted moisturizer and rub your lips together \) you can definitely build this up to a sort of 60 's pale high value peachy pink look , but it 's a bit too moist and shiny to really stay in place definitely not a good shade for my coloring , but if you 're caucasian and fair , this will complement you bottom line if the formula is the same for all shades , i 'd see this product as a great , moisturizing sheer lipstick and go for the darker shades to match the tone of your skin but if you 're looking for a darker or more saturated \( or matte \) look , i'm not sure this would be the best pick , nor will you probably get the exact shade you 're seeing on the screen a few minor things i agree with the other reviewers the case is awesome \( yay german design ! \) also , i may just be more sensitive than most , but this definitely was n't tasteless there 's certainly a subtle typical plasticky lipstick taste when you first apply it , but it 's not terrible and dissipates there 's no added artificial parfum or flavor to the formula , so that 's what you get lastly , i ca n't go without giving uslu products for being cruelty free say no to animal testing !
3	full disclaimer here i am not an artist and i have no eye for color people like me should never buy a product like this ! lol okay full out of the way , this was a very complicated product for me my skill level consists of two shots of moisturizing sun block and one half shot of bb cream lather , and go so this kind of thing is way out of my comfort zone the product is very compact not at all like the picture shows 3 x 3 in a very slick compact with mirror , brush and magnetic corner snap locks the makeup is on the heavy side there are five bubbles around a central larger circle of makeup the large circle is the main color that should kind of be about your skin color next we have a lighter bubble , a highlighter tiny bubble and under that a darker bubble then there are two more bubbles on the right hand side a yellow corrector and a peach neutral sigh try after try i made a color lighter than my skin and around the color of ground cigarette ash and old lady pallor i know , i am , no need to leave comments about my severely lacking skill set my palette was the fair shade i could not for the life of me get my skin color right but i have no skill set with makeup i am sure other people can do this like breathing to be sure if you can do this , i recommend watching some of the michelle phan videos
4	high quality that you expect from german products ! did n't work well for me but my skin is sensitive
5	this small compact has two colors pink and peach the peach side is used in areas needing shine control or a matte finish the peach side will reduce the appearance of lines and pores the pink side is used to moisturize skin the pink side leaves skin hydrated , supple and radiant you simply apply whichever effect is desired using your fingertips neither color seems to really show up or tint your skin the product readily absorbs into your skin the peach side is mattifying and reduces shine the pink side is sort of like a gel and absorbs in kind of leaves a gentle glow this formulation did not cause my skin to react in any way overall , this is a good set to keep on hand
3	i have fair skin , light brown hair with highlights and blue eyes i love the color of this if i put it on just right it looks natural there is no pad or brush included so i do n't take it with me i generally use a brush and use the powder sparingly over my checks , forehead , i i tend to have hot flashes frequently and this disappears i would love to be able to re apply it and am not willing to bring it with me along with a fluffy brush i wish it were less and came with either a compact brush or a buff then it would be much more useful to me
4	this is some of the nicest quality eye shadow that i 've ever used unfortunately , it 's not my favorite , mainly because the dark brown is a bit cooler color than i prefer , and the lighter , golden color would be better \( for me \) without the glitter shimmer , although it is n't as pronounced once on as others that i 've used the colors go on smoothly , blend well together with a brush , and last all day the compact set is good sized and the case includes a generous mirror it arrived with the shadows intact and they do n't fall apart easily with use the colors are heavily pigmented so it does n't take much to achieve the effect that you want i feel that these are high quality shadows and really worth the cost , if you find the right color i will continue to use these and experiment with them and others that i have i would recommend this brand from my experience due to the high quality and quantity that you receive
5	saw this nail polish color on pinterest and i searched the stores trying to find it and then i saw it on here and i was a little skeptical buying nail polish online but it came brand new and the color is a dead match !
3	i really felt awkward trying to these powders to line up correctly , i ended up just leaving them separate they come in a handy little bag that i have been carrying in my purse , great for quick touch ups the colors are fairly neutral and blended in well for me \( brown hair , brown eyes , olive skin \) my issue with this was that the quality was n't all that spectacular in relation to the price currently charged it is a neat little purse set but pricey for the size quality l
4	it is nice for my purpose , as i use not for real noticeable contour i am using it only on lower inner lash line , just to help my almost non existent lower lashes \) it is usually as bit wet there so gel or something like that does not hold up it goes on nicely and stays all day one thing if i want a bit thicker line for , then i end up having kind of in the inner corner of an eye in the middle of the day
5	this curling iron is fabulous ! ! i 've always bought conair curling irons over the years and just about every 2 years i end up having to buy a new one for different reasons well since i 've been using this hot tools curling iron , it 's the best ! it heats up very fast and the heat is evenly distributed through the barrel plus , it came with 2 extra metal pieces for the underside of the barrel that allows the iron to open ! and in my experience before , when that piece breaks , you have to buy a whole new curling iron so that was an added bonus i did n't expect ! overall so far a ! !
5	i'm happy with this it has good coverage and matches my fair skin well i apply it with a beauty blender and then blend with a foundation brush i have sensitive skin and have not noticed any irritation a little goes a long way
1	i was truly excited to try this moisturizer vichy has a great reputation and i had high hopes i have to moisturize as i get eczema if my skin gets too dry , and i jump at any chance to try a great lotion , cream , or body butter what i am picky about is smell and residue i can handle light , natural scents , but nothing that lingers or is too perfume y and i prefer that my skin feel clean after , not greasy or sticky i tried this first on my hands and arms it smells very strongly of perfume and the scent lasts , so make sure you like it as it will be there for a while ! and it left my skin sticky i to wash off and not use it any more oh well i did expect more at a 29 price point
4	citrix vitamin c pro collagen brightening serum feels more like a lightweight oil than a serum to me it is easy to apply with the dropper lid that comes with it i use a couple of drops on my cheeks and a few on my forehead then rub it all in it is clear in color , light feeling on my skin and has a faint smell of oranges i appreciate the scent is light and not overpowering as i am quite sensitive to scents and have been known to stop using produces due to the smell giving me a headache i have dry sensitive skin and i am happy to report i have not had any irritation or breakouts while using the citrix it absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it feeling moisturized with out feeling greasy or sticky i do feel that after using it nightly for the past two weeks that my skin tone appears a bit more even and my age spots appear to have faded a bit i have not noticed a decrease in wrinkles but my skin does feel a bit smoother the price tag in this would usually deter me from from this product but it dies not take much so the bottle should last me quite a long time i will probably end up ordering more as it is really helping to fade my age spots and make my skin tone appear more even
5	great basic as long as you do n't have heavy makeup to remove
5	the color paints on smoothly it can appear to be a dark purple or dark red , depending on amount of coats i have used it alone , and layered if you put 2 coats of dark and one thin coat of a red on top , this beautiful wine color comes out depending on the darkness of the red , a color close to essie wicked can be achieved it is a nice color to add to the collection
4	i was pleased with this skin care set , but not in love with it because it is tuned to a younger man 's skin \( in general \) i believe this to be the case because the three products seem to reduce the amount of skin oil on my face a lot , which is not so necessary now that i am on the doorstep of \( 59 years \) i can see i am about ten to fifteen years past this product and probably should start thinking about dry skin instead of normal looking at each product in the set the wash this comes in a nice , practical plastic pump bottle i found i only needed a single pump or less to wash my face very thoroughly what scent there is reminds me of the old product from many years ago it is non greasy or oily and left my skin clean and dry feeling ready for the next step the herbal toner the toner comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip top cap the scent is a light herbal it is a thin , clear liquid that is easily applied using a cotton ball or pad since my wife keeps a good stock of cotton cosmetic pads in our bathroom , i used those scrubbing these around my face seemed to remove a good amount of dead skin cells and other debris that the wash did n't take off the moisturizer once again , the product is pretty neutral in its scent , which i found to be good for me in fact , none of the three products is very perfumey , which is a plus for most men in any case , the moisturizer is non greasy or oily this is nice at first , but i found that it seemed to dry out after application to the point that i felt like i could use more on my skin so , i put on more and found that this would essentially evaporate or go away completely , too as a geezer , i think i need to have a bit more residual help so , i 've ended up going back to cetaphil lotion to put a thin cover over the top of the baxter moisturizer conclusion this hits a lot of things right for men it is not heavily perfumed it comes in bottles and a tube that are practical in size , shape and use it works the only reason i took off a star was because of the need for a bit more emollient action for me in the moisturizer , and that is likely because i'm a geezer if you have oily skin , this is not going to be an issue for you and it is possibly a five for that application
3	i liked the idea behind this palette but the reality just was n't impressive first , while the colors in each group were pretty enough , the pigmentation on many of the colors was poor also , i found many of the shadows were difficult to blend on the positive side , creasing was minimal and the color \( what did come through \) did last over the course of the day so the quality of these was really similar to what you would find at the lower end of the drug store selection also , the design of these also seems poorly thought out while this kit came with a handy small magnetic compact that you could load one color into so that you could take it with you during the day , there was no place in the compact to add a brush ! also , there were labels to to the compact to identify the color but they were n't reusable so they would only be good for one use and the sizes of the shadows did n't make sense colors that you would use more of , like base coats and highlighters were small sizes , while colors used for eye lining were larger unless you are going for the l look , chances are you wo n't be using that much shadow to line your eyes i think this concept had a lot of promise but for the price of this set , the delivery just is n't there
5	lovely color ! soft , pretty , slightly iridescent , more on the mauve side than pink great coverage
5	very nice product ! my husband is so happy about it says it leaves his face feeling so nice and that it rinses off his face so easily he has sensitive skin and since he got this is now shaving daily
5	i love this it works really well and absorbs into damp hair quickly i have left it on for the recommended time and rinsed out but i have also sprayed it on out of the shower and enjoyed the effect on taming and moisturizing me ends also the violet tones have been fab for any brassiness i almost deducted a star for the application it 's a spray which is a bit annoying in the shower but then i thought about how much i hate oils that dump out and i use too much , the spray lets me apply the right amount
5	simply put , this product is excellent i'm black , and black people have thicker skin since this product has aha , it allows other products to penetrate deeper into the skin as a result of using this product , other products will work that much better i received this on wednesday and my skin is brighter , glowing and a lot smoother i'm probably going to buy a second bottle excellent , excellent , excellent , etc \)
5	i much prefer creme blushes to powder but they are harder to find this one is excellent for several reasons first , it has a nice creamy texture and goes on smoothly and evenly the color is evenly distributed in the product so it was easy to apply using my fingertips i have used other brands where i ended up with splotchy looking color but i did n't have that problem with this product the color is a mauve with some subtle rose gold highlights it is a neutral color , not too warm or too cool i have very fair skin and it was easy to adjust the intensity because the color is sheer i was able to make it darker by applying just a bit more it spreads easily on both bare skin or over foundation the color looks natural which is the most important thing to me it lasts all day and if i want it darker at night i can just add a little more i really like this product and will order more when this container runs out
3	it 's too bulky , hard to handle
5	it 's nail polish it was unopened , it was the color i wanted , and it arrived relatively quickly what more can i say \?
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	this mascara has a wand that applies the product evenly and without clumping i usually have to apply two coats to get the length extender feature , but it does make my lashes look a little bit longer and somewhat fuller the black color looks good on my lashes the other thing i really like about it is that even after a long day i do n't end up with traces of mascara under my eyes which is the case with so many other brands of mascara i use a remover to get it off at the end of the day but it is n't particularly hard to remove i really like it
5	love it love everything from vichy better than any expensive product and always gentle on my skin !
5	i 've tried everything and this works best for lift , wrinkles and clarity wo n't try any other products as it far exceeds other products all nia24 products r great
4	i got this for my husband who needs to wear a high spf sunscreen we both prefer the mineral type but in high levels , it leaves a white mask effect this does , too , but not to the degree other brands we 've tried it 's also not too greasy and absorbs well after a 10 15 minutes at that point , if you blend it in some more , the white cast is almost invisible
3	very gentle ewg gives this a 5 , mostly due to propylparaben i 've been trying to eliminate products like propylparaben and any parabens
5	i drooled over this color when it arrived ! i bought it as favors for a bachelorette party and so did not want to give it away ! it has a really pretty subtle shimmer
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	sometimes it is hard to differentiate what any one nia24 product does , especially when using several of them every day the one thing that i have noticed since adding this to my cleaning and moisturizing routine is that my face is noticeably softer and stronger it is kind of interesting because i always think of my soft skin when i touch mine , but hers was soft and paper thin mine is soft and strong it feels great i have always been taught to put moisturizers on in the order of thickness , starting with eye creams and then the thinnest in order to do that with nia24 products , i always start by putting several on the back of my left hand the skin on the back of my left hand is gorgeous i like the feeling of it being protected from the elements even before the yard work and seasons start
5	definitely good soap , i just wish the price was lower
2	first baxter product i am not a fan of for my hair it does nothing it goes in pleasantly and has a nice odor that lasts about as long as it will take you to get dressed my hair is fairly short and truthfully i do n't get the purpose of the product as it does not hold my hair in place at all maybe someone with longer hair would find a better use by themselves of curls , but as for me , the slight i do get this product is not worth the money
5	i got this for my husband mainly because his previous taste in male perfume has been extremely smelly so much so that it gives me a headache if i walk into the bathroom even a half hour after he 's used it ! ! eternity is so much nicer ! it 's got a masculine , delicious smell that is n't overpowering so far everyone who has smelled it has really enjoyed it , and i enjoy that not only does it smell great , it is n't overpowering and has n't caused any headaches ! ! i 'll definitely make sure to stuff his stocking with this every year from now on !
5	love the scent of the body butter very nice
5	i bought this for my sister who loves nail polish it arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color she gets compliments on it all the time , and like other essie polishes , it does n't chip easily
5	another dermablend hit it does n't require a lot of product , is full coverage , and if needed , is build able for more coverage it does n't have a scent nor does it irritate my skin if you set it appropriately , it does last a while this product hides blemishes well such as acne , redness , and sun spots offers a good amount of spf as well overall a wonderful product and brand
5	color is beautiful and as stated in description i have been looking for this type of blue polish for the longest time the polish goes on smoothly great quality !
5	fabulous hair dryer really fabulous dries quickly , even with my long hair does n't and still leaves it shiny i 've had probably 5 hair dryers in 5 years and this is by far the best
3	there are a lot of things to like about v76 strong hold that lasts most of the day , messy look without looking greasy , application to dry and damp hair , and it washes off easily however , one big downside is its overpowering vanilla scent which lasted at least 4 6 hours at least before it diminished those who are sensitive to strong fragrances may want to look elsewhere the v76 is n't a enough product to make me switch from my usual cibu sticky rice
5	this color is incredible ! great formula that applies beautifully and does n't chip easily ! fast shipping
5	i have really sensitive lips and a lot of products will make them dry out or flake easily these are a lot of lip scrubs and b i 've tried all the ones in sephora ! this one is amazing really exfoliates and does n't dry out or give a bad reaction i still always moisturize after
5	this japonesque kumadori buffing brush is perfect for apply loose powder it applies it evenly and helps to cover your face in an efficient way this one is smaller than the japonesque fan brush i love it
5	i was introduced to this product on a cruise 3 years ago and have used it ever since ! this is a very high quality product , excellent for sensitive skin
5	love this sunscreen it 's lightweight and not greasy and i can use it alone or on top of a light moisturizer it 's on elf the best sunblocks out there i wish they made a heavy duty sports version that was water proof highly recommend
5	i love it so much ! it works on the acnes and pimples very fast fast dry and fast healed
5	great soap
5	i tried it out in the salon first to make sure it was n't hideous and had to buy it immediately ! they did two coats at the salon and it covered well enough , but i did three super duper light coats at home and it looks even more gorgeous i 've had it on for two weeks , and like all other shellac done right paint jobs , it 's just now starting to look a little and needs to be
4	a bit about me , i 've been wet shaving for probably close to 2 years , and in that time have tried about 20 brushes or so this brush arrived in a large cardboard tube , and inside was the packed brush and an instruction sheet the case for this brush is aluminum , and the knot fits inside the brush when not in use it 's assembled by removing the ring at the top , taking out the knot , screwing it to the ring , and screwing the ring back to the case the quality of the materials was top notch , and i did n't notice any blemishes so on to the shave i heated up my scuttle , that has a brush warmer , and put some hot water on my soap i tried the brush with 's rose cedarwood soap , which is fairly firm it soaked for about 15 minutes while i took a shower the soap lathered up easily with this brush , and it held a decent amount of lather i do generally prefer a denser knot than this brush had though during the lathering i did not see any shed hairs , so that was very good the brush was n't at all floppy , and i was able to work the lather into my beard very well i did notice a strong animal scent with this brush , so you may want to deal with that pretty early on , especially if you plan to pack the brush and travel my only real problem with the brush , was when i was loading it and working up a lather it did tend to unscrew itself not a huge problem , but distracting i would n't say it 's my favorite travel brush , but it 's a nice convenient setup which i would recommend
5	love the color ! perfect for summer just like what you buy in the store for more than half the price
3	my make up regimen is a washing followed by nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href olivella moisturizer dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 olivella moisturizer a , then nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href covergirl smoothers liquid make up creamy beige 1 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 covergirl smoothers liquid make up , creamy beige , 1 ounce a the moisturizer is 100 olive oil , so it leaves my face slightly greasy but it also helps the make up blend in very well on my face i follow up with a very light dusting of loose mineral foundation for a nice matte finish the only trouble is i hate using loose messy i thought this bliss solid powder foundation \( in natural \) might be a good alternative its color seems to match many of the medium translucent and beige shades i normally wear , but i cant seem to get it to blend as well as loose powder it appears much heavier and dry looking on my face im not impressed maybe thats how solid foundations work if so , ill stick with messy but lighter applications of loose powder and brushes ive included a color comparison shade \( center with mirror attached \) most closely resembles the loose powder on the right called medium translucent im a blonde blue eyed gal , and can use both beige and medium translucent colors
5	perfect color for the holidays !
5	best iron yet it is expensive at 200 00 , but it does a terrific job at flat ironing my very long hair it allows you to control the heat from 450 degrees , ceramic plates and it heats up fast it has hand touch technology that offers safety and energy savings and automatically reduces the temperature in half when the tool is n't touched in 3 minutes it does a terrific job at straightening even course hair wonderful product
4	toleriane teint is indicated for sensitive and combination to oily skin , but it also suits my normal to dry sensitive skin well the texture is a thick mousse instead of being thin or runny , but it goes on light instead of heavy before applying it , i follow my usual skin care routine , including applying a good face serum , face and eye creams and corrective concealer for dark circles and blemishes i dab small amounts of toleriane teint on my forehead , cheekbones , nose and neck and spread it with my fingers by using an outward motion until it all blends together this product is so easy to blend and feels good on my skin it 's not at all greasy and does n't feel damp or rub off if touched , plus i have n't experienced any caking it also does n't accentuate my fine lines like some other foundations this product gives my skin a velvety soft and smooth finish that feels breathable and looks natural and lovely plus , it 's fragrance and preservative free the golden beige is a bit dark for my untanned skin , but the tone is a good match and still looks attractive and natural overall , i'm really pleased with this foundation
5	love
3	foams up nicely , but the slippery ness and odd fragrance does not appeal to me i think the slippery feel is from the amount of glycerin \( second in the ingredient list \) the fragrance reminds me of something i tried a few decades ago it is tangy , but not quite floral and not quite citrus every time i use it , my brain on trying to identify the fragrance with the slippery feel and the weird fragrance , the product does not give me a pleasant , uplifting experience i do n't hate it i do n't love it it may suds nice , but i do n't feel any great benefit from it it has not helped , nor hurt , my facial skin
5	unlike many other moisturizers with spf , this one goes on smooth and blends completely into the skin does n't leave your skin with a pale , other look
4	this hydrating foundation product from la roche posay is as high quality as their brand would lead you to expect , and while it 's expensive it might be worth the price it feels creamy but not greasy and applies easily and a little goes a long way nice consistent shade and a long life once applied , with no heavy feel on the skin , make it a good choice , even despite the pricing
4	i like it gives my fine , short hair some oomph without my having to get goo on my hands not crazy about the scent it 's mild , but i prefer non scented but it seems to dissipate quickly enough
4	its very rich and creamy i like to use it on my neck area very moisturizing would not use it on my face as i'm pretty sure an acne party would little bit of a bummer because i wanted something ultra moisturizing for my face for winter but no biggie and at least my neck is happy \) oh and my boyfriend who has very no fuss clear skin year round sometimes uses it when hes too dry he likes it and he is not a product guy at all so thats saying something so i think people with non fussy faces that are dry would love this maybe i 'll work up the courage to try on my face
4	i am not normally a buyer of a lot of different face products i try to cleanse well and make sure i moisturize and use sunscreen , which i normally prefer as part of my moisturizing routine i have started using this but really only at night since i do n't want to add sunscreen on top of this for day wear and am happy with my normal product this is pleasant , and light actually , a bit lighter than i would expect , i expected something a little thicker the smell i expected to be more apple like but it was more of a citrus scent , but nice , nonetheless i would say this has done a nice job on my skin making it feel soft and may have eased a few fine lines but i do n't know that i feel it is worth the price that is charged it might also work even better with their other products but i am not looking for a cleanser , and serum and a moisturizer \( thanks , i have other besides my face \) i will definitely use this up and it should last a while , but overall , it was a nice product , glad i tried it , but i do n't think for me that i will use instead of my tried and true
5	love the colors !
4	i had to apply this a few times to my nails in order for the cuticle to be reduced the cuticles are not as neat as when going to a salon but if you 're in a pinch , this works great
5	all is ok thanks
2	this color was fine as a bright alternative to my usual look it goes on paler than in the pan and is a great color for fuschia lipsticks but it streaked like crazy on me i also hated the packaging somehow the compact is really hard to open not a keeper
4	i like this color it is exactly as pictured an opaque cool pink i used two coats for even coverage
3	though it did n't come with an applicator \( many high end cosmetics do n't \) , i liked how easily and smoothly the blush went on my cheekbones the powder mostly stayed on my brush rather than flaking off , which was true of cheaper cosmetics i 've used having never used blushes that had hints of dew drops before , i attribute the light shimmer to the presence of these drops the color is peach and not particularly striking this color is perfect when you just want a warm , natural glow i kind of like darker shades , so this type was n't right for me
5	thanks
5	excelente
5	i have been using the mario badescu seaweed cleaning soap for several days now i do n't use a lot of cleansing soaps but i am very pleased with this one the 8 oz bottle is easy to handle and use the screw off top has a nice opening to allow you to get the amount you need to use , unlike some flip lids that do n't make it hard to get product out of the container allow the lime green color of the product is nice the cleansing soap is a little thick but thats the way it should be message a small amount of cleansing soap onto your skin in a circular motion rinse with warm water my skin felt clean and not dry made for all skin types this product is made in the usa i will be adding this cleaning soap to my daily washing regiment i really liked it i can also see this being included in a nice gift basket with other mario badescu products no one would be disappointed with that nice gift basket
5	i really do not like spending this much on any hair care product , but when i tried it at a salon i really wanted it for home it really does work better than any other conditioner i have ever used and since i only wash my hair twice a week i am making it last i also purchased the shampoo which i also love but i think that just using the conditioner with a decent shampoo is all i will need in the future i have very frizzy hair and this really smooths it out i really love it
5	my heel is beauty products the more natural the better i was very impressed with rose elixir i have read that essential oil from rosa is especially useful for dry and sensitive skin complexions i used 's beauty tip and mixed 4 drops with my moisturizer in the morning i felt my skin was hydrated throughout the day without any greasy residue and did not clog my pores the dropper is easy to use and appears well made the smell heavenly this product also had an expiration date of 05 19 i am so frustrated that my suntan oils do not have an expiration day me to throw them away too early this is an expensive product probably comparable to a moderately priced serum used before your moisturizer
4	this is the second vincent longo product i 've tried , and i'm impressed with it while the color i chose ended up being too dark for me , it provides nice coverage and helps cut down on shine the included puff is n't that great , which is a shame since this is the type of product that you want to keep in your purse or bag for touch ups the color is interesting since it has a mix of tones in it , which makes it look natural on your skin the texture is a bit than i like , and , because of that , it tends to cling to my dry patches if your skin is smooth , though , this should work well for you my personal fave is still mac 's blot powder , but this powder works well overall
2	even using it twice a day did n't make a tiny bit of difference , i would not recommend this product
4	this jane iredale naturally glam eye shadow is good eye shadow it applies easily , blends well , and lasts this kit includes 5 shades feather , lace , , satin , and velvet it comes in a shiny , rose gold mirrored case and includes a dual ended applicator this make up is made in the usa the downside to the shiny compact is that it shows fingerprints and the like the negative of the make up is its high cost bottom line , it is good make up , but expensive
5	like all mustela products we love this one too the lotion is really light and feels great it definitely moisturizes the skin without feeling oily it has the light mustela scent and works really well it does not irritate our kids' sensitive skin and really helps the dry skin on their cheeks very effective product
4	i do n't have much experience with foundation in high school , i wore the cakey stage make up for shows , which i think may have had something to do with my general aversion to it but recently , i have started experimenting a bit more into the world of foundations the first foundation that i tried is more of a tinted spot check , very light coverage this is a more substantial foundation it feels a lot thicker and has better coverage this shade is perfect for my winter tones with a summer tan this will be a bit too light , i think but overall it goes on nicely , and provides a smoothing look that evens skin tone color i feel like , overall , my face looks smoother and i do n't feel like my face is too stiff or cakey with this makeup i may not wear this everyday , but i will certainly wear it on special occasions !
5	all essie nail polish are terrific at least thats what my thirteen year old granddaughter tells me
5	light , without the oily feel of liquid foundation my favorite for everyday use expensive , although it lasts several months small container is light and not at all cumbersome to carry in a purse
3	it 's a thick cream and smells like other creams you can buy at costco or cvs felt nothing special about this lotion a bit disappointed with ahava
4	this baxter of california herbal mint toner is marketed for a man 's skin but as a woman , i like it so much more than any other toner i have tried it removes leftover make up residue from my face even after washing with my clarisonic i have acne prone skin and i have noticed less breakouts on my chin since i have incorporated this into my nightly routine the smell is very faint , not at all masculine or perfumey it has , clean and natural smell that i find relaxing and calming i love the way my skin feels after using this
5	love it
4	nice manly scent , not like a girly girl at all not too overpowering , unless you lay it thick like primer on an old seems to be strongest within the first 15 minutes or so then it becomes very subtle subtle to the point that she needs to be close , close , to get a decent whiff of your then she 's all yours
4	this is an easy to apply powder foundation coverage is buildable and it looks natural it has a light comfortable feel but does not last long unless you use finishing spray i found that it did tend to blur imperfections more than actually cover them still and improvement the color was a tad too warm for me and had a slightly orangey tone that did n't work with my skin packaged in a serviceable black compact , it does not include an applicator of any sort
4	this is a beautiful light fragrance i lit it in my bathroom while taking a bubble bath and it was lovely just a hint of fragrance and not overpowering the design is simplistic and matches any decor without being or ugly so far this candle seems to be burning at a significantly slower rate than those cheap candles in the big box stores
4	i like this soap more than my husband does he thinks it smells too girly i think it smells like citrus , and it does create a nice lather and feels good on the skin once the skin 's dry you do n't even smell it on your skin anyway my only shock is the price seriously , bucks for a 5 ounce bar of soap \? thus i knocked off a star
5	great scent very light refreshing does not stay with you all day , have to refresh i would totally buy this product again
5	this is one of my favorite face make ups it seems to provide the most coverage for blemishes and uneven tone while still being natural looking and very simple to apply \( i put it on like a tinted moisturizer or bb cream and often wear it alone \) it works well for my combination skin , though it does n't seem to really be moisturizing to me spf and a , c and e are things i look for in a face product so i love this contains all of the above i selected nude as being the best bet for my skin color my complexion is light and just on the rosy side of neutral this looks a bit yellow going on but seems to blend to a great match i do n't know if this produced is that versatile or if i got lucky with a good match
5	smells nice
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	exactly what i expected
5	love this color , it 's a fun neutral
5	love this nail polish was impressed it did n't have the bad stuff in fact , i recently found out their nail lacquers are formulated without carcinogens i guess in the us we allow it but in the uk they do n't the polish color is true to what 's in the bottle and it lasts long i would say it lasts about 5 days which is two days longer than what i usually wear this royal navy color looks amazing on your fingernails and on your toes
3	i think i just ordered the wrong product , but i 'll tell you my experience the scent is super strong i could smell it all day it 's not a bad scent , just strong i have short medium hair and it is perfectly straight and flat i thought that if i applied this to my roots it would my hair and keep it from looking so flat that did n't work it made my hair feel gummy and matted and actually weighted my hair down again not the fault of the product i think i just ordered the wrong item
3	color is beautiful it takes two coats to have accurate color it does chip easily but compared to essie it lasts longer i do not like the brush and hope they improve it because it makes it harder to apply otherwise this is great ! hope this company comes up with a new design however very happy with this unique blue grey combo i gave three stars because the color is fabulous and i love how its healthier for the body !
2	i 've been working to eliminate harsh chemicals from my skin care regime this rating of 7 from ewg is mostly due to fragrance and look it up at ewg org also , many people complain that they do n't like the way nia 24 products smell i like they way they smell , but most are too strong
5	blinc lash primer should be applied to eyelashes prior to applying blinc mascara heck , you could use this product under any mascara i like that ! i believe blinc lash primer does help nourish my eyelashes my eyelashes are definitely longer after i apply this product i like that i can apply this product , curl my lashes , and then apply the mascara over eyelashes that have already been by the primer the primer brush does a great job separating lashes , as well i'm applying this primer after applying my eye cream \( i wait a few minutes \) the primer helps protect my natural eyelashes and helps adhere the blinc mascara \( again , you could use any mascara with this primer see my review of blinc mascara for more information on that great product \) the product goes on white so you will want to use mascara over it i 've never worn it alone or longer than a few minutes to see if it stays white when i apply my blinc mascara over it , i first apply to the white tips of my lashes to ensure i 've covered that then i apply to remaining lash area what i like is that 1 there is no clumping 2 length of lashes is increased easily by applying additional coats 3 it does n't irritate my eyes , skin , or hurt my natural eyelashes 4 this really thickens and fills in my eyelashes as a step before applying my eyebrow mousse and covers grey eyelashes really well yes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have no dislikes for this product
5	pomade is amazing ! ! you only need a little i 've put it on my edges and it holds amazing i also used on my daughters hair and her edges are laid down we both have african american natural hair highly recommend
5	not as shimmery as the image shows , its definitely like a dark gray , the image looks more of a 'silvery' look , but still a really great color i love it
3	pretty color but it does n't really stain the lips for long wear it disappears quickly
3	the color looks just as good on as it does in the bottle \( if you use a super shiny topcoat \) , but the formula is pretty awful it went on super gloopy and dried extremely fast making it hard to work with and despite my buffer , base coat , and seche vite top coat , the polish chipped the next day it reminds me of butler please gorgeous color , but do n't expect it to last more than one day on your nails
5	i 've used hyaluronic acid serum on my face for over a year and it has been amazingly effective it 's given my skin back a healthy glow , minimized the finer lines and reduced the crepey ness that was starting to develop the thing i do n't like about most hyaluronic acid serums is that they range from thick \( like egg white \) to watery and since most of the companies that sell them are very small , the vary wildly dr brandt has the to this problem this new serum feels like a creamy hyaluronic acid it 's lush and thick while still being silky and super smooth it feels delicious on my skin and because it 's creamy it seems to go even farther than regular hyaluronic acid gel products i use an amount about the size of a pea and it covers my whole face then i apply my moisturizer , which goes even farther with this underneath i 've only been using it a short while , but i will update this review after i 've gone through a few bottles so far , though it 's very promising
5	i always re order this product my previous reviews no longer exist because the reseller is gone so i am going to c p my original review i'm an african american male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth it makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and i ca n't where the low to bald styles since i have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids it 's so embarrassing that i do n't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator one day i discovered toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair i thought what the hell , it 's worth a try toppik has completely changed my life it 's not perfect but look at it like makeup it covers up just enough so that if you did n't tell people they would n't know i have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that i started using it and asked if they saw any difference they said that stuff is f amazing ! if you have thinning or balding hair , scalp issues to cover up it 's worth the money it 's not gonna stay on overnight it 's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat i 've even tried holding spray and it will work but i personally have to gel my hair so hard that it 's not favorable all the time those are the only downsides take it from me and my friends it works and its amazing \)
4	seems to be working on all areas of my eye i use just a dab , because it is costly ! ! ! have used before and do like their products
5	this color was a lot of fun very neon i used about 3 coats and it is so nice i got a lot of compliments on it
5	very pretty color !
5	i have used juice beauty since 2008 every , cleanser , toner , mask , serum , lip moisturizer , etc has left my skin feeling and looking exceptional their spf 30 sport moisturizer is no different after applying the moisturizer , my skin feels smooth and protected many of the jb moisturizers i have used in the past , especially those with sun protection , including this sport moisturizer , are thick in texture and leave almost a white finish on my face , which is not a product everyone person can wear , as everyone has a different tone of skin however , with some gentle onto your face , the white tint will minimize \( i understand some individuals do not favor the thick , white finish , but i have made it work for me \) i also appreciate that once applied to my skin , i feel satisfied that is does not easily rub off onto clothes \( through changing sessions \) lastly , when i simply do not feel like wearing makeup , i use moisturizer solo , which always blends nicely onto my skin i spend a lot of time outside , and thus far , i have not suffered from extreme sun damage thanks to this and other spf juice beauty products compared to other juice beauty products , 16 is not a bad price at all knowing that my skin is protected makes this product valuable to me i highly recommend it , and i will continue to purchase this moisturizer as well as other jb products !
5	this is a pretty polish as all butter colors are it 's perfect is you 're wanting a color that 's dark with sparkles but do n't want to do black
1	i 've tried this consistently for a month now unfortunately it has done absolutely nothing to cure my acne scars i have fair skin with a lot of acne scars this tends to break me out after i use it , i'm assuming because of the beeswax residue that 's left on the skin to help seal the vitamins it also seals clogs the pores from my experience , i would n't recommend this , just pass on this one
5	i had this color done in a salon before i purchased it i almost did not buy it online because the color i see on here looks nothing like the color on my nails i was so sure i got the wrong name off the bottle , but i did n't ! this color is a really beautiful teal , not a light to medium blue with a slight hint of turquoise just thought i 'd give you a heads up so you do n't get sad when the color that shows up at your door is teal instead
3	\( as an update i let a friend borrow this shampoo who has very long thick hair that tends to frizz and she loved it ! could n't say enough good things about it so , for her she 'd give this shampoo 5 stars \) bottom line on this shampoo is for 22 a tube , am i impressed enough to want to purchase it , or it to a friend \? and the answer is not really now , that written , it does n't mean the shampoo does not have merits or is n't really great for my , or your , hair however , a shampoo this pricey has to make me go wow ! i love this product ! and i did n't have that experience i have tried many many shampoos and what i look for to wow me is do i like the scent \( if a scented product \) does it make my hair look shiny do i notice any difference in my hair price compared to experience etc i used a coin sized amount and applied to my wet hair it did lather up quite well i did n't notice any scent at all with my experience so if you like a little or non scented product , you may like this \( i do n't know why some reviewers noted a heavier scent that has me why i had little or no scent at all \) i like my shampoo to have a fresh clean or exotic scent so i was a little disappointed in this the product rinsed out well after towel drying , i blew dried my hair , and i did n't say wow ! my hair did n't look any different from when i used another shampoo in my arsenal that cost half as much as well , i had just applied semi color to my highlighted hair to deepen the color a bit , and was hoping the wow would extend the color but from the first shampoo with wow , some of the color was still lost i do n't blame the shampoo i was just hopeful that the first shampoo would n't strip any of the color using an expensive shampoo the next day after shampooing , my hair was limp this happens often with certain shampoos , but i was disappointed that my hair did n't look amazing for the price of this shampoo i will say as for the price i have bought aveda products that were quite pricey , but i have that experience with those products of my hair looks and smells amazing ! that 's what i here with this shampoo some shampoos just work for some and not so well for others it 's all in how our hair reacts to a product on a positive note , from the claims and ingredients or lack of certain ingredients , this shampoo may be healthier for hair , but i as i wrote above , i have shampoos that cost half as much for which i am pleased with the results they claims as stated color security shampoo is a 180 degree departure from typical color care products not only formulated without sulfates , it also does not contain silicones , conditioning agents or agents one or more of which is found in virtually every sulfate free shampoo on the market this may make this shampoo great for my hair but i still want that my hair looks and smells amazing ! effect that me to want more as with all my reviews , i ask myself would i purchase this and would i be excited enough to recommend it to a friend \? and the answer is i am not sure i would perhaps with continued use i 'll be convinced , but so far , i ca n't imagine spending 22 on shampoo i would recommend to someone who wants a shampoo that does n't have the and sulfates and etc as this shampoo advertises for me , i just want a shampoo that leave my hair looking great , smelling great , and is in my budget
4	ive gone through my share of expensive clarisonic products for skin cleansing , and i mean gone through plenty of them they leave me with the feeling of being ripped off since id find them non after a year or so plus , the who invented them are in the money if the clarisonic products are not breaking , you have to refill the heads of brush bristles on a regular basis ive also tried some cheaper , fake of clarisonic models , but found those to be just another waste of money a couple years ago , i discovered a much more frugal alternative , the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href solo mio sonic face cleanser and massager brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 solo mio sonic face cleanser and massager brush a , and found it to be an effective face cleaning instrument recently , ive had the opportunity to try foreo luna face exfoliator brush and silicone cleansing device for combination skin , and , though its pricier than solo , the device is larger , and it has the added anti aging feature , which at my age is more of a necessity than a perk ! anyway , i use the foreo device twice a day , morning and night , and i find it gives my pores a deep down good cleaning though the device cleans thoroughly , one problem im experiencing , however , is that the unit does not keep its charge for prolonged periods and seems to run out of power prematurely before it is charged again apart from the charging , i can feel the difference on my skin foreo leaves my skin super soft and smooth , especially after i rinse the cleaner off my face , dry and apply moisturizer with the foreo though its not as as a professional facial , it feels gentle and on my face , and i certainly feel proactive trying to combat the aging process ! i have n't my foreo , but hope i do n't encounter the same problems other reviewers have had with fake ! 3 5 stars due to my charging challenges
5	for whatever reason , i have not been wearing any cologne over the last year or two as part of the amazon vine review program i saw this product come up and thought i would give it a try coming from a respected and well known brand i felt the design and quality of the product would be good i have been using for about a week now and so far i like how it smells as it is has a nice masculine scent without it being overdone , like i'm at a club or something i can wear this to work and not feel like a cloud of cologne is following me around while people are in meetings are for air although expensive i would buy it again my wife at first thought it was overpowering but after a day or so now says she likes it , as long as too much is n't put on she is a big fan of ck1 , but said this is also nice even though her favorite is ck1 i guess i can wear ck1 on mom and dad date night and reveal during the work week
5	i drooled over this color when it arrived ! i bought it as favors for a bachelorette party and so did not want to give it away ! it has a really pretty subtle shimmer
5	i gave this as a gift to my wife she is very fussy about which perfumes she likes and will wear bottom line , and good news for me , she loves it ! the bottle is unique and elegant in itself presentation in perfume is important ! the overall impression of the scent is floral , but not hit you in the face strong however , it does have a full bodied range of scent as well , with mid and low notes that round it out the write up itself sounds delicious and sensual , with exotic fruits and seductive florals and then , deeper notes of black orchid , liquid amber and even for a quality perfume , the price is reasonable as well recommended !
5	this product works so well as long as you use the scrub fresh and the top coat , per the directions , this polish will last at least a week with no chipping !
5	wow , this is really effective on allergic dermatitis and some psoriasis issues it calms the itching almost immediately and provides a long time of relief it absorbs easily and does n't leave the skin feeling too greasy
5	this was my first time with this product and it works way better than the new purple shampoo ! ! ! it really feels healing ! will i order again \? probably not because the purple shampoo to go with was such a disappointment my hair stylist wants me to and save so i can use products on my hair
5	good skin care
4	i just took a shower and used this body scrub my skin feels softer , i do n't see the flakes of dry skin on my legs and arms and i am pretty sure i smell better \( it might be the deodorant , not sure \) while in the shower , i scrubbed my entire body now i did n't feel any warmth , burning or any other issues and i have eczema and psoriasis if i were to have an issue with the product , i am pretty sure i would have had it by now but i only feel scrubbed clean i used it everywhere except private areas that would be more tender i would love to try the entire ritual especially when i can have some me time and relax in the tub
3	the color is a bit darker than what i expected and i feel like it is a fake essie bottle , because it is different from what i bought in cvs
5	smells great , feels great my skin feels brand new the next morning
3	this polish is watery way more so then the other colors maybe its a fake i do n't know i should have bought in store
5	beautiful color ! !
4	this is an okay straightener it warms up pretty quickly , it goes smoothly thru my hair and is fairly light weight it also comes with good directions and professional style hair clips to section off your hair while styling it that being said , it does n't do as good a job as other straighteners that i 've used \( bedhead and chi are the two i use most frequently \) i have fine hair that is curly and frizzes easily , so it is n't too much of a challenge to straighten normally i would n't suggest this for hair that is really difficult to straighten as it just does n't seem powerful enough for that
2	i use the red correcting crayon in this brand and it works fairly well this crayon looks like , well crayon , on my light olive complexion it may be that it is not for everyone but i wish that there was some guidance as to which skin tones this works with it comes across very light against my skin and it is noticeable
5	like all butter london nail lacquer , fruit machine is ! the color is soft , classy , goes on in 2 coats
5	i bought this after falling in love with mario badescu products i have oily combination skin and this is my absolutely favorite moisturizer it is also a wonderful sunscreen i will always push anything mario badescu , always wonderful products
4	it passed the first test i have allergies to some products and after a week have had zero negative reaction i never thought i 'd ever be a guy that used products like this but after my birthday i was n't happy with the face i saw looking back in the time i 've been using this i have had a definite lightening of a couple of ugly dark spots on my forehead and my skin feels smooth the only drawback i can see is the price there is no way that i could afford to use this regularly but if you can i'm sure you will love this stuff it is a great product
3	i must admit that i do have baldness which is pretty obvious i have thinning of hair in the back of the head as well as in the center when i got the opportunity to try this review sample i was excited that may be i might see some new life to my rather sparse hair on my head i started using this product as directed and noticed that each day i used it i started getting headache so i had to stop i am certainly having some reaction to the ingredients and did not want to take any risk further reading the reviews from others here on amazon it does not seem to indicate anyone else is having headache issues \? anyways , i have decided that i will give couple of weeks of break before i attempt this product again just like another reviewer here on amazon i too experienced the same sound when this rather attractive box arrived and i first opened it the tiny vials were scattered all over the inside of the box surely the manufacturer must consider taking this feedback and review the packaging style maybe provide a smaller box or a foam insert to secure the vials in the box luckily for me none of the vials were broken i am force to rate this with three stars based on the experiences that i encountered i am willing to give this another try in couple of weeks and revise my rating
5	love this colour , exactly as described wish i could give more stars since this was the fastest , cheapest shipping for any purchase i 've made on amazon , ever would definitely purchase from this seller again
5	i loved this nail polish , i had seen it around the blogosphere and was so excited to try it ! i ordered three different essie polishes , and they arrived before scheduled time ! highly recommended seller !
5	i love jane iredale products and am never disappointed this was perfect packaged well i will buy j i again
5	not for your or girlfriend this is a manly scent that really wakes you up in the shower i use it as a body wash and love the scent and how it leaves my skin feeling clean its got a tobacco infused scent that reminds me of the rugged outdoors and smoking
5	love my cnd !
2	i was about to buy rogaine when i was offered the phyto to try i have had hair loss in the past , due to some medical conditions , but those are under control and the new thinning seems to be related to changes due to aging thus , i decided to try the phyto first i apply it like close to the scalp and then rub it in , once must be very careful or it will be a greasy clumpy mess running late from work with a shoe in one hand , wand of mascara in the other , and trying to dump this on your scalp is not the way to go , patience and a bit of time are required after using this i did n't notice anything other than about the second week it started irritating my scalp and flakiness and itching began now , in addition to my hair falling out , i had flakes i'm going to let my scalp recover completely and try something else the phyto is packaged in one use vials which are convenient and i do n't have to guess at the amount
5	i love this product , works well , covers any thin areas and you ca n't even notice it just really wonderful , and this colour is great for dark hair
2	the pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails , no matter how many coats you put on i mixed it with a white polish , which helped , but you should n't have to do that do n't expect a solid color
5	my favorite product for a quick makeup look it 's able to be layered , so i use two layers of this and a setting powder and i'm good to go for the entire day
4	this goes on smoothly and has n't irritated my sensitive skin it does work toward keeping the the acne at bay i break out less as expected , it is drying but there is also a moisturizing agent in there so it is n't completely dried out 1 5 salicylic acid is a good amount not too much and not too harsh
5	i am a user of bare minerals , benefit , and urban decay i rarely since i am allergic to just about everything \( which is my problem and no fault of any cosmetic company \) so , i had a little worry when i tried this \( especially on my eyes \) but , wow , it was just gorgeous \( and with no negative reaction at all \) ! the pigment is really lovely and stays put better when you use a primer \( but most make up does \) and the size of the case is perfect ! it easily fits in my little marc jacobs camera case bag \( and , the inside of the top lid is a full mirror ! ! ! ! perfect ! \) also , i think this pairing of hues \( 06 \) is outstanding ! ! i am so enamored by japonesque ! i'm now adding them to my short list of overall great products great products for sensitive skin !
5	this is actually the first opi nail polish i own , ca n't complain the quality or the color green is n't the usual color i go for , but this was a beautiful green , first coat and second coat both looked lovely
4	with no discernible fragrance and zinc oxide used for the spf factor rather than chemicals , this hampton sun might be worth a try if you 've had a reaction to other , less expensive anti aging creams i do have a tendency towards allergic reactions , but have had very good luck with neutrogena product line since i was a teen , and they 're typically my go to for my very basic beauty regimen however , i'm always willing to try new things , and with still an occasional acne breakout happening on my now wrinkled 50 year old face , i figured maybe switching to a different moisturizer might make a difference i 've been using the hampton sun for 40 days , with no noticeable difference in skin texture , tone , or wrinkled ness \( yep , term there ! \) it is easy to apply , feels very nice going on , and disappears well into the skin \( i was worried about this with the zinc \) i still got the occasional pimple while using this , so either the moisturizer i was using was n't causing it , or i have n't given this one enough time to get rid of whatever effects the neutrogena had on my skin i'm leaning towards thinking it 's just my skin and i'm stuck with a few zits every so often i 'll continue to use the hampton sun and if the pimple situation changes , i 'll revise my review accordingly otherwise , unless you have had allergic reactions to other face creams that contain chemical sunscreens or fragrance , i do n't see an advantage to this product over much cheaper options available at your local drug store
3	i thought this would have some color to it when i ordered it but , what i got does not it is sort of gray in color once i put it on , it was invisible the packaging emphasizes that it is a sunscreen 15 , which is great however , it says it is a primer maybe i live a tool life , but i do n't know what a primer is i put it on under my makeup and the makeup went on smooth as silk other than that , i'm not sure what else to do with it i 'll have to investigate it on the internet because the packaging does n't tell you , nor does the description here on amazon help much if you know , please tell me !

5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
2	the exfoliating quality of baxter of california night cream aha comes from this lotion 's glycolic acid base , which is a very mild alpha hydroxyl formulation after several weeks of use , i saw no redness as i 've experienced with other exfoliants but neither did i see any real change in my skin i like the feel of it non oily , dry , almost talc y dense , yet easily spreadable and a dab covers quite a bit of territory but after 30 minutes , my skin feels no different than before night cream aha is not entirely odorless for me it 's got an elusive nearly chemical fragrance i'm grateful it 's not spicy , floral , herb like , or overly medicinal , and i'm also grateful it 's not long lasting my spouse said , it feels nice , non greasy , and but something about baxter 's night cream aha is bothering my eyes , causing unusual dryness and minor stinging this happens even though i apply the product far , far from my eyes and even if i just put it on the back of my hand so i started looking into the list of ingredients , which i included below some compounds such as certain fatty alcohols may be derived from animals or plants boc makes no claim that the night cream aha is vegan , so there is no reason to expect that it is other ingredients like hydrogenated polyisobutene have used animals in testing \( and yes , there were \) still others sorbitan stearate , glyceryl stearate , and cetyl alcohol have been considered toxic and environmentally dangerous in canada then there are the four \( four \) parabens , i e preservatives , recently associated with breast tumors granted , parabens have not been found to cause cancer , and they can exist naturally in some foods \( grapes , \) and even show up in some otc pain but has seen fit to butylparaben from certain child oriented products the fact that boc chooses to use four parabens is worrisome this ingredient list , along with no visible results except for the dry , stinging eyes , makes me happier to just do without boc right now it was a nice to have that was nice to try , but ultimately it might not be so nice to earth and animals humans included ingredients water \( aqua \) , c12 15 alkyl benzoate , hydrogenated polyisobutene , cetyl alcohol , sorbitan stearate , glyceryl stearate , glycerin , ethylhexyl palmitate , glycolic acid , peg 100 stearate , ascorbyl palmitate , benzophenone 3 , butylene glycol , dimethicone , , disodium edta , panthenol , propylene glycol , sodium pca , sodium hyaluronate , sodium hydroxide , stearic acid , officinale leaf extract , wheat amino acids , butylparaben , ethylparaben , methylparaben , phenoxyethanol , propylparaben , fragrance \( parfum \) , blue 1 \( ci 42090 \) , yellow 5 \( ci 19140 \)
5	i 've tried several of the proraso shave soaps and have been happy with the of all them i tried this one because it said sensitive skin i did n't really notice a difference , but i 've never had a problem with any proraso soap there is n't much scent to this one , but like the others it makes a rich , creamy foam that never goes flat
3	this self tanner is an improvement on the old orange and streaky sunless tanners somehow it still does not look natural i would never advise using it on my face that would just be too it definitely works better than spray self tanners and again the available mitt helps in application to achieve close to a natural looking tan one has to be careful in applying it around knees and elbows and especially any scar tissue it will turn many shades darker so for those areas you need a lighter touch if you follow directions and let it dry it will not stain clothes or bed linens
5	this is by far the best bronzer i have ever used all the other types i 've used were really well pressed into the compacts so it took a lot of dabbing with a makeup brush to get the bronzer onto the brushes and then the bronzers always went on so lightly it left little more than a subtle copper sparkle on my skin but this bronzer is exactly what bronzers should be it 's soft and just like any other type of face makeup , easy to apply and work with included in the palate are three bronze shades and then also a highlighting pen so you can contour and or blend the colors giving you the exact shade or look you are going for i'm loving how the makeup melts into my skin \( i guess that 's why they call their makeup butter ! \) and gives it a beautiful bronze glow the color is so much richer than other bronzers i 've used it 's a makeup rather than a barely there powder you dust over your face this is such an awesome bronzer and it gives skin an amazing summertime glow !
4	essie is my favorite polish love all the different colors
4	this smells really yummy given the truffle in the name , i would n't have expected it to smell tropical , more like coconut oil , but that 's how it smells it also feels very nice on my skin it is n't heavy and a little bit spreads a long way this makes my skin feel nice and smooth but i do n't know how much wrinkle fading to expect because i did n't see any of the retinol type products in the list of ingredients but if you have dry skin , this should be a nice serum
5	\( see update at end \) over time i have had the opportunity to work with many different levels of face cream products some have been remarkable and some have been awful some have been okay but nothing extravagant this cream seemed interesting and worth a look as a makeup artist who in mature skin , i am particularly interested in finding products for skin care because it greatly improves makeup application and appearance not having the right skin care is one of the biggest problems i run into with older women what is this night cream like \? the vichy neovadiol replenishing care night cream comes in a rather small glass blue jar with a silver plastic screw on cap there is a inner liner in the jar so that means that product will not leak all over if you happen to have it in a case laying on its side from time to time the cream itself is part way between a soft gel and a lightweight cream think of a hair conditioner that is not runny but can hold its own soft in your palm and that is about the weight of it the cream has a pungent fragrance to it which it seems like you either love or do n't how does this night cream perform \? i have used this cream for enough time to get an excellent feel for it you do n't need a whole lot just a sized dot on each cheek , chin , and forehead seem to take care of the entire face and for me i can bring it down along my neck too the texture is surprisingly lightweight i would compare it to algenist firming and lifting cream as far as weight goes and how well it absorbs into the skin this is nowhere near what i expected for a night cream it feels deceptively lightweight i put it on in the night and also the morning on a dry day and the absorption is such that i do n't find it tacky or oily at all it leaves the skin feeling moisturized without being a problem of having to wait long to put on makeup \( in the morning \) results \? i have seen good results with this cream moisturizing lasts for 24 hours when using this cream at night only except on days when the heat is running a lot with no humidity brighter complexion definitely improves the appearance of the skin with a subtle glow lifting and firming action resembles some of the higher end creams , but perhaps not as marked as lancome multi action and lines seem to improve slightly but nothing remarkable as of yet i will update over time as i continue to use this how does this compare with other creams \? i have used many brands of face creams of this nature among them are lancome absolue , lancome \( various styles \) , algenist , yes to blueberries , yes to , clinique , dior , chanel , la prairie , l'occitane , sk ii , ole henriksen , l'oreal , olay , peter , lorac , fresh , philosophy , origins , and clarins , just to name some of them i would put this on a par with performance i have gotten from algenist , , yes to blueberries , lorac , fresh , and clarins it is not quite as effective as the lancome , dior , and have been but it is not far behind so far in my experience i think it is a good it sure is a lot cheaper the bottom line out of the many lines of skin care products i have tried over time , i think that this night cream is one of the better ones it does perform well in a relatively short span of time for me deceptively lightweight , it leaves skin moisturized , brighter , firmer , and in decent shape without oiliness or tackiness the only thing i have a difficulty with is the pungent fragrance the first few times i have used it , it literally turned my stomach and i thought i would not be able to use it at all so far i have moved past it , but i do notice that my eyes tend to act a little sensitive to it even though the cream is nowhere near my eyes where i put it it is almost like the fragrance waves get in my eyes and make them a little watery , but not so much as to stop using the cream at this point so far , i have been able to work past that , and am enjoying this cream it does make a difference on older skin \( i have tested it on much older skin too \) and if you can get past the fragrance , it is worth checking out for half the price or less than some of the top effective creams for the fragrance , i have given this four stars if it was not so pungent to me and hard to get past , i would rate this five stars for the price range of this cream if you find yourself in or just past menopause , i think it would be a good cream to try out , but even if your skin is just very dry , it might also be worth trying out just be prepared if your eyes are sensitive or if you are sensitive to smells this cream has potential to irritate some people update i have changed this to five stars as time has passed , i have learned that if i use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href 99 natural hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz 29 6 ml liquid dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 99 natural hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz \( 29 6 ml \) liquid a nbsp on my skin before applying this cream , it really improves the performance even more i usually do that for most creams but did not in my testing of this product i also have obtained the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy neovadiol replenishing care moisturizer 1 69 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy neovadiol replenishing care moisturizer , 1 69 fl oz a nbsp which i use during the day , this for night time use only i like the results even more , although you can easily use the night cream day and night if you can only afford one the results over time have improved even more and i have to say that this is an excellent choice for mature skin makeup application improves greatly for mature skin after using this product i plan to tell mature clients about it when i do their makeup , as skin care is the most important part of making your makeup look good as you get older , especially past menopause the scent no longer seems to affect my eyes and i find myself noticing it less than when i first got it i still wish it was less cloying , but at this point , the cream performs so well that i am raising my rating to five points will update further if there is anything to add update 10 2017 i wanted to add that i use this product regularly now and am really impressed by the long term effects the combination mentioned above is a winning team and half the price of some of the other products that i have used over time for myself and recommended to clients if you can look past the scent of this line , it is well worth the effort it is still great stuff ! very luxurious feeling
5	i liked the way this feels on my skin light and soft , yet it does a great job of moisturizing i tested this while back home on the east coast during very cold weather , when my face quickly became dry and felt like fine sandpaper , and the aqualia made a huge difference having the hyaluronic acid in the cream is much more convenient that using ha by itself , too i used is as a night cream , not as a mask the consistency is smooth and light , and i did not notice a scent the cream has a light blue color and the jar is a deep blue i did not notice any adverse reactions and my skin did not feel greasy or oily i 've tested another product that cost several times what this product does , but it was heavy and left my skin oily even in the morning after a night 's sleep aqualia was just perfect for me at 28 , it is not inexpensive but i think it is worth it a little goes a long way , so a jar will last quite a while 5 stars
4	great color , a good summer go to shade
5	fast delivery ! exactly what i was looking for thank you and will order again
5	essie 's the lace is on is a beautiful color and has become one of my favorites nice cross between purple and magenta with some shimmer \( but not glitter \) that adds depth to it sophisticated color suitable for all ages
5	i bought this to cover my zoya nail polish and i am so glad i did ! it keeps my nails looking new for over a week , even with heavy use of hands and washing the shine is brilliant and helps my nails stand out
5	really awesome lotion ! i ordered it after reading it would help soothe facial skin after using too much acne medication \( seriously dry spots \) , without causing new blemishes and it 's true i always overuse , have dry spots , then get new acne from the moisturizer i try to use , but this did n't make me break out it 's got a great feel to it and soaks right into your skin very safe for your face !
5	really love how bright the color is already have the whole neon collection but wanted a 2nd of this shade
4	eucalyptus has a very strong , medicinal scent of course , you knew that the first day i used it , my hair was still wet when i picked up my daughter she stepped in and immediately complained about what was stinking up the car yes , this is powerful stuff , but i used eucalyptus body wash not long ago so i'm used to the scent odor it lathers up well and it cleans my hair i'm happy with it , but i probably would n't buy it off the store shelves there are so many other scents that i like better lots of people like the smell of eucalyptus , though if you are one of them , you will like this
5	pretty classy nuetral looks good on my light olive skin tone im in healthcare and this looks clean and professional essie always pleases !
4	i really want to like this color because i love purple and i love dark nail polish this purple is very , very dark though i felt like it looked black most of the time and only looked purple under certain lighting maybe i put it on too thick \? who knows , it could very well have been my fault and i will wear it again because it is pretty i only wish it looked a little more purple ish
5	this is the best shampoo for color treated hair ! seriously ! i have been using this for almost 2 years and my hair dresser always my hair quality !
5	great nude color for everyday wear
4	this oil provides hydration to my dry skin a little goes a long way , so this bottle will last awhile i noticed a difference in using it my skin felt softer i used it after exfoliating , so i could get the complete benefit it did n't irritate my skin , and it has a pleasant scent i like it
5	seems to be keeping my face very clear !
5	ahava dead sea mud dermud intensive foot cream has to be the best foot \( and hand \) cream that i 've used my feet \( and skin , in general \) are extremely dry i normally lather gold bond with shea butter on almost every night , and i still have dry feet this dermud cream makes my feet feel so good for a much longer time than my usual route i 've even used another ahava formula and thought it was good , but nothing so far has compared to the dermud cream my hands also feel really good when i rub it all over my hands after applying it to my feet of course , i would prefer if it was n't so expensive , but i use much less of it than the gold bond , so the price might even equal out somewhat i highly recommend this cream if you have extra dry skin
4	goes on smoothly , and has good bristles but the color was n't exactly how i had pictures i will still use it , especially since i am trying to get my boyfriend to buy my engagement ring
4	very good for that extremely dry skin it 's thick , not runny it spreads easily no scents , no dyes , nothing toxic about it , but it does leave behind a sticky feeling it goes away by morning but for a while there it 's like you stick to everything it serves its purpose though and seems to agree with sensitive skin
3	very oily results
5	this stuff rules
4	you need very , very , very little of this to really make an impact it 's radiant alright i typically only need one quick pass with a very light dusting of blush to achieve the color i'm looking for any more than that and it 's way too pink it 's really light and airy , though , and i love the texture i may have to opt for a warmer color next time as this one 's a bit too cool for my tastes , but i think i 'll definitely be sticking with it when i need more blush but , based on the amount i use it will be a very long time before i need to get another container !
5	essie does deep pink better than anyone we know ! this color is perfect for the beach or the bistro go for it !
5	great color ! i love it too bad it 's discontinued
3	this product is promoted for either whole face or localized application on blemishes my wife found this particular product was not strong enough for correcting blemishes or occasional breakouts that she experiences on her chin the active ingredient in this product is salicylic acid , which cleanses pores without excessive skin drying it stops bacteria from \( \) , and does n't clog pores \( comodogenic \) but does n't kill existing bacteria so it works well for her as a preventative , but did not show any visible improvement for the chin breakouts blemishes products with benzoyl peroxide work better and faster for her , for occasional breakouts she also found this did n't absorb well in her skin , but stayed in a gel like layer after application then after allowing some time for absorption , she rubbed it in further before it fully absorbed most serums absorb much more quickly and easily on the plus side , its a very natural product without harsh chemicals , and did a good job of hydrating the skin while this particular product did n't work for her needs , she is a fan of juice beauty products and has liked their other products , and would try them again
4	this is my 1st time using zoya nail polish i absolutely love the color ! ! ! it is the perfect nude for my skin tone ! ! i love that it is 10 free ! feels good to know i'm putting less chemicals on my very thin natural nails all that being said i did find that this polish is very thick and a little hard to apply it took 2 coats to get a somewhat even application maybe it having less chemicals makes it a thicker paint , so i took one star away for that reason i will try again and see if i can get a better application next time because i am truly obsessed with this color ! ! i have included photos with and without the flash on so you can see the true color of
5	i like pca products and this is certainly no exception arrived sealed , good seller
5	this polish is less like a pink and more like a skin color , which i guess can be pink based on the color of skin a person has i really like it and think it 's pretty the shipping was quick the polish was not goopy
5	i would take a bath in this stuff if i could the version is my favorite but nothing against the others as i 've liked them all aside from the awesome makeup removing abilities that this line carries , the ingredients are top notch if you 'd asked me 2 years ago , i would n't have known or cared so much i 've taken the time to my skin care and this is a staple this particular one seems to moisturize a bit better for me versus the sensitive and the sebum one of of the few products that has never once burned my skin , even when it has been damaged
4	i love the texture of this mask it smells nice and does make your face soft and supple my only complaint is that i have sensitive skin and this does cause me to get white heads if i use this for more a few nights a week otherwise , it works great to moisturize i have an oily t zone and dry flaky skin one the of the t zone for reference it really works great on my dry areas , especially in the winter to keep them moisturized
1	in person it 's different then pic
5	this is an elegant hair straightener i was n't able to get it to curl or wave my hair , but that was n't a problem for me maybe with more practice i was able to get it to be stick straight and that 's why i ordered this my hair is no more shiny with this straightener than with others , but i loved using it the hair clips are well padded and sturdy and hold my hair in place while i work on other areas
5	essie does deep pink better than anyone we know ! this color is perfect for the beach or the bistro go for it !
5	my husband and i have been buying this candle for years each candle lasts about 6 months with roughly 4 hours burn time a week we love this brand \( and this scent \) because it fills our home with a pleasant yet subtle scent i 've tried other candles that smelled pleasant at first , but after about 30 minutes of burning began to smell overly sweet fake
3	the good does n't feel greasy has a sunscreen \( 50 spf \) in it but is n't waterproof so use an actual sunscreen if swimming or heavily antioxidant complex \( vitamin cg vitamin e \) to help protect skin from free radicals caused by uv rays causes no noticeable irritation on my sensitive skin so far goes on smoothly and makes a nice base for makeup the concerns contains oxybenzone , which is a sunscreen that blocks out uva uvb rays however , not to mention the oxybenzone may have on the environment \( read the other reviews to learn about that \) l , it turns out that scientists are n't 100 positive oxybenzone is not linked to endocrine \( hormonal \) in humans , cell and yes , even lead to skin cancer none of this is 100 proven yet , but there is enough concern that studies are still being done on it the recommendation is to avoid sunscreens that include oxybenzone , retinyl palmitate \( a type of vitamin a \) and anything over 50 spf the price is substantial to those on a budget \( or just frugal \) there are alternatives that will do as well and without the concerns of oxybenzone my to the manufacturer for a less than positive review i just ca n't recommend this product with the concerns i \( and others \) have about the ingredient oxybenzone and i want people to know that it 's not necessary to spend a chunk of your to have beautiful skin do some research on the concerns about oxybenzone to see some natural and lower cost options this is just my opinion
5	the smell is very nice
3	this was just ok i normally use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href earth science chamomile green tea eye makeup remover oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 earth science chamomile green tea eye makeup remover , oz a nbsp and thought that this might work even better well , it 's actually worse the earth science eye makeup remover is 1 67 an ounce currently , whereas this vichy eye makeup remover is selling for 3 33 an ounce so , the vichy brand is nearly twice as expensive if i compare the ingredients , the earth science is more natural i do n't like that vichy contains artificial fragrances as those are 1 \) not beneficial to the skin and 2 \) give me headaches i wear a some heavy duty eye makeup eye primer , long wear eye shadow , waterproof eye liner and water proof mascara the vichy eye makeup remover has a consistency like water and has to be applied with a cotton ball i find myself tugging and pulling quite a bit across my eye with the cotton ball to remove my eye makeup the earth science has a gel like consistency , as such i usually apply a little to my fingers and then gently glide across my eyelid to remove their ability to dissolve makeup is about the same as such , i gave the vichy 3 stars that said , i would not purchase this brand and will stick to earth science my reasons being that i do n't like the watery consistency of the vichy , i do n't like the scent or ingredients , and it 's twice as expensive
5	i used to buy it in the salon till it went up to 45 bucks it is great to use it you iron your hair everyday without it getting greasy i also use it on my legs that are so dry from the winter the smell is nice bit not overpowering
5	i love these products you polish your nail and in less than 10 minutes you are out the door ! this color tinted love is an awesome pinky red color ! ! perfect for any time and looked great for work or play
4	i like this foundation by la roche posay it is medium coverage and i use this during the week as on the weekend i typically use a lighter coverage foundation this goes on nicely and wears well through the day the shades are accurate too
5	this is pretty expensive in the salon , but amazon has a better price i think it smells nice the best part is that it helps me with split ends and tangles i would n't call it a miracle product , but it does work i can use quite a bit without it weighing my hair down not sticky or heavy i 've already bought several bottles
5	perfect red for me
2	too many coats have to be applied to get the color i was disappointed when i had to keep reappling polish is very thin
5	great product
5	this is not an antiperspirant this is only a deodorant , and i am rating it as such this deodorant works well for most days it has a light , pleasant scent i try to walk steps a day , and using this , i have no problems with even after a 1 mile walk at a reasonable pace so i'm giving it five stars this works better than many other deodorants i have tried although to be honest , it 's just as good as other french deodorants i have tried that are half the price however , i know better than to expect it to hold up in heavy exercise or hot weather that 's not what this is made for i expect this bottle to last quite a long time so it 's a decent value i am always looking for new deodorants that do n't contain aluminum a chemical that some say may cause health issues we all know the science of this is safe \( wait five 10 years \) oh , never mind it 's not safe so i try to use less aluminum
5	the perfect neutral color ! very fresh looking !
5	each time i use this japonesque makeup setting spray i like it more and more after all my makeup is applied and on i put a on to hold my hair out of the way i hold the can about 8 inches from my face , close my eyes really tight and spray lightly all over my face i keep my eyes closed for a about a minute i use a tissue to blot lightly to take the excess off it leaves my face looking so much better and yes , like it has been airbrushed with an expensive unit the best part of this i cannot be without this product and so very happy to have it
5	the benefits of niacin for your skin are well documented so i was very excited to try this product i'm so happy with it ! i think my skin looks and feels great lately after using this regularly and i have n't ever had a product where i noticed such a difference it did n't cause any adverse reactions or breakouts despite it being an oil i almost always apply it by mixing it in with a moisturizer and this works very well this product is very expensive but you only need 2 3 drops each use so i think it may last quite awhile i love this so much i want to buy their other products despite the cost
5	everything ok
5	excellent
1	i was n't a fan of this cleanser at all it 's gooey , messy , and feels like cement mix also there are many black specs in it that sticks to everything , and not just your skin these black specs will stick to your sink or shower the consistency here is not pleasurable and i would old good old fashioned soap instead a big pass here katiebabs
3	i thought the color would be more on the pink side , but it had a slight orange undertone at least on me which was not flattering at all
4	i generally like the color , which i use over dark circles around my eyes \( light concealer over dark features looks artificial \) i am not so happy with the brush it applied the concealer unevenly and was too small you might do better over flat moles with a brush this small or in forehead lines if it matches your base tone
5	i just love this color \)
4	have n't used it but i used the one i bought from juice beauty com i like it as it blends well into my asian skin however , i want it to give more coverage as my skin has freckles and pots
5	i'm love it !
5	gorgeous , deep color that looks great on all skin tones nice consistency and great shine another example of color and quality from essie brand great price from company , too
4	as i get older my hair has lost some bounce and smoothness and has become more brittle and difficult to manage i have used and have been willing to use almost anything that would help the condition of the ends of my hair this oribe intense conditioner has worked great for me i started using it after every shampoo , but find that i only need to use it about every other time now the smell is luxurious , with a slight spice and freshness to it it only takes a small amount to the ends of my hair and then i worked it back towards the scalp it is the quality product that i expected from oribe granted , its so expensive , but this tube should last me a good while
5	i like all cnd shellac as far as shellac goes this color is very pretty goes on great and lasts !
4	i have dry skin and i use this along with bioelements sleepwear before i go to bed it 's perfect it makes the area around my eyes feel soft i have n't used it long enough to notice any change in the lines around my eyes
5	great light weight moisture !
4	i was surprised to find that this is a very light , airy cream that is used twice a day as a moisturizer , and lightens the dark spots over time very nice i love the feel of the cream and it goes on easily it 's not an instant cure , but then it 's not designed to be
2	i 'll start by saying that i really like pca products but this is definitely not one of them i did n't care much for this toner theres not much i can say except that i prefer the pca nutrient toner it is smaller and a bit pricier but it leaves my face better plus it smells great update i am a big fan of pca skin products and i had to update this review because i really believe i was sold an expired toner and other pca products i stopped buying pca products on amazon after comparing them to the ones i bought with my dermatologist or skinstore com i noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products i bought on amazon where different and where able to come off sadly i ca n't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore com or skinstore com will not even give a small discount on pca products \( pca products are always excluded from promotions \) the a c serum i bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have the newer \( better quality \) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump with that said choose the vendor carefully
5	amazing fresh , clean scent perfect for the office or bedroom the scent is not particularly mysterious or complicated it smells like rosemary and mint not sweet mint , more clean , fresh mint i think the rosemary aroma is fairly strong so if you like the smell of rosemary , you 'll like and if you do n't like rosemary , i suggest you pass the glass jar is exquisite , a beautiful green , and the burn is quite slow and clean , so i expect this will last a while i wish it came with some sort of lid to keep it covered between burns but that 's my only complaint expensive , but quite lovely and long lasting the glass jar is gorgeous the picture does n't at all do it justice it has beautiful shading and variations in the pattern i use the glass jar as a it is exquisite and here i am a few months later , back to buy another one ! lafco candles are pricey but they burn so slowly and cleanly for me , burning this while i work at my desk at home adds a little luxury to my day
4	this is the first product of this type i 've tried , so i ca n't compare it to another i use it at night before i go to bed , but have n't noticed any oily residue on my pillow cases my hair is fly away and this tames it , which is a great help no noticeable scent my complaint is that the oil is so thick it does n't flow through the pump i have to unscrew the top and pour it out onto my hand kind of a nuisance , but i can live with that i 'll have to use it longer to see if my hair 's texture improves
3	i 've used this peel once weekly for the two weeks i do n't usually use a lot of products on my face other than a gentle cleanser and a daily moisturizer , but i now have a infant and a and i am starting to look like that dust bowl farmer woman from that famous 's photo i was hoping that the peel would help my skin look just a little brighter and younger and not like i need a nap i also have freckles , so its claim that it would lighten hyperpigmentation appealed to me the product does burn or tingle on your face , but less so than other hydroxy acid products i have used in the past , so it does seem good for sensitive skin after rinsing it off , my skin did feel sort of squeaky clean and rubbery plump , so it did get that top layer of skin off i ca n't say that i'm noticing much change in the appearance of my skin though i still look tired and my pigmentation is just as hyper i will continue to use it once or twice weekly and hope that i see some change if that occurs i will update my review accordingly i can say that it feels good on the skin and if you like using a peel product , this seems like a good choice with its ingredients
5	i love the fragrance and the of the oil it is just perfect after shower plus , the attached suggested sitting it in warm water which i did and it was absolutely wonderful
5	this is amazing for under eyes ! first , dot on very lightly then use a beauty blender \( or make up sponge \) to gently blend this in use less than you typically would with other products \( this thoroughly covers \) if you need just a touch more , add a bare minimum , and then blend again use the dermablend foundation over this \( for uniform color \) again , apply less then you typically would blend , blend , blend the results are just gorgeous and the look will appear natural and polished as long you you use a minimum and then blend as needed dermablend is easily one of the very best products on the market i have used their line for years and years ! love it ! so highly recommended !
5	love the color
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	nice bright color after 3 coats , cause at first it is streaky
2	juice beauty green apple age defy serum is too much for my sensitive skin other non sensitive juice products do not irritate my skin the way this does it is pleasant to apply , but it did leave my skin in a state a closer at the ingredients revealed salicylic acid \( from white willow bark \) , which is an ingredient that my skin tends to against
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	best mascara i 've ever found , and will never use another again bear in mind that this mascara does not build or extend lashes like many others will it is a downside i am willing to sacrifice , as i have small eyes and small lids that lend to guaranteed eyeliner and mascara smudging i used to rarely wear liner for this reason , and on the infrequent occasions i did , i would spend much of my time fixing the smudges on my lower lids this liner is not fussy , is easy to apply and remove if one reads and follows the instructions
5	gorgeous deep purple color looks more berry in the photo here , but i still really love this jewel toned purple it turned out to be
5	great product does n't leave you hands feeling greasy or slippery
1	update began to burn my eyes after a few uses they stung so much i will never use this vichy or recommend because of the burning i do n't understand why it hurt so bad after a few uses original review \( four stars \) the vichy normaderm 3 in 1 micellar water facial cleanser is good , but i felt like my skin still had cosmetic residue on it after i used this product with a cotton pad i had an urge to wash my face with water regular cleanser after using this , which i did my skin felt much cleaner after that the cleanser also spilled into the sink because it pours oddly , so just make sure to put your cotton pad over the hole before the bottle this is great stuff for removing my \( not waterproof \) mascara , but i will probably follow up with my regular cleanser i like this to take off makeup , but wo n't recommend to fully remove dirt and cosmetics all over your face
5	i have used this drying lotion before and i really like it if i catch a blemish early , it dries it up overnight also , it i used it on mosquito bites and it took care of them i have really sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products , however , have not had a problem with mario badescu drying lotion i , also , bought a bottle for a friend
1	i have sensitive eyes im allergic to practically all high end mascaras and thought i should try this since it 's made for sensitive eyes it was no different it made my eyes super itchy and made me want to pull my lashes out i 'll just stick to my cheap drugstore maybelline also , this stuff would begin to flake into my eyes after 4 hours of wear
2	yes , i bought this luxury shampoo after much consideration i read about it in lucky magazine and that beauty has never been wrong the shampoo is n't bad , but it did n't do much for my hair except make it a little dry fuzzy \( my hair is straight w layers \) it has a nice smell and a weird consistency i 'll use it \( cause i have it \) but it is n't that great
5	beautiful but i have to use very lightly at my age ! does crack easily but i am very careful with it
3	i had a manicure and pedicure done and i asked what product they used they stated essie so i came home and wanted to see if amazon carried the product i purchased four of them i wish i had not we all know pedicure 's last longer and for the most we do not need to touch up our toes for awhile well not the case on our fingers it chipped with in two days of the manicure i had already received my products which i ordered , so i applied the chipped nails the product is ok if you have time to coat at least three x 's and wait to it dries i have inquired with others at work and they state the same thing i suggest not to buy the product unless you have time to waste applying sorry for remarks , but do not want others to be disappointed it 's better to pay a higher price than to buy a less expensive product
5	really loving this multi spring water spray first of all i like the size of the bottle it will definitely last me longer than most aqua sprays , appreciate the simple design and the easy squeeze pump spray it comes out in a gentle mist pic enclosed i know you can use it as a toner but right now i'm using it to set my makeup i feel like it really brings out the pigmentation in my highlighter for that extra glow without any irritation pic enclosed this item can also be used as a great cool down mist for your face in the summertime and i will probably buy another bottle to use it as such then this provides a cooling sensation that i need i did n't realize how great water therapy was until i actually felt that burning sensation from the suns rays and i needed a gentle cool down to refresh the skin on my face a great addition to my makeup routine for any time of year !
4	nice color , but very thin
5	dj play that song is a semi neon purple color with red undertones i say semi because it 's not a blazing neon it can be worn to work it looks just like it is pictured in the bottle pinkish purple i tried to take pics after applying but my camera would n't capture the real color i tried in sun shade indoors lights but did n't work the color is really pretty to naked eye saturday disco fever is a bright pure orange color this is not a very blazing neon , so i am able to wear it to work it looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors i felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in summer i was a little apprehensive at first because i personally do n't like yellow orange shades but this color worked for me it is more red toned than yellow toned this dark orange looks good on nails too the formula on both the polishes is great two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish they dry quickly but dry matty ish so top coat is a must for me i applied a base coat \( opi base coat \) , 2 coats of polish and a top coat \( opi top coat \) they lasted more than a week on me which is rare \)
5	i do n't have tattoos but i do have dark circles under my eyes i was surprised how well the dermablend quick fix foundation stick concealed and brightened this problem area the product stayed put and still looked fresh at the end of the day the sand color blended well on my light to medium skin i tried covering a few dark freckles on my arm with the foundation stick but i found the product tended to rub off after a few hours i did not use setting powder as recommended so i suspect that would improve this product 's use as a body makeup this product is generously sized and well worth the price for a foundation concealer that stays put on my problem areas
5	this is a sooth and moisturizing lotion , and does not irritate my skin it leaves my skin very soft and applies very easily i only use a small amount and that does the trick i have not noticed any wrinkle reduction , but the moisture effect is awesome it smells nice too i recommend and the price is fair not great
5	i'm caucasian and pretty white , but for some reason , a lot of red nail polishes have just made my hands look kind of dirty and unappealing another problem i 've often had with them is that they end up looking brownish instead of properly red come to bed red is different to me , its the perfect red , a true red that is n't pink , is n't brown , and is n't neon i get a lot of compliments on my long , natural nails and part of how i keep them from getting damaged is to apply many layers of this , which creates a thick finish that is surprisingly durable , often lasting several days with little to no tip wear and zero chipping one complaint i have is that i 've found bl polishes take a very long time to dry , but the fact that the polish is thick and that i apply many layers overall probably worsens that also , it 's frustrating that it seems to get thicker as you use the bottle up even so , i love it and repurchase again and again in this colour
5	my esthetician this she was right ! it keeps a low profile so it 's easier to see what you 're doing but still makes the skin just slick enough to help with smooth shaving there 's no slipping around freshly shaved skin shows no signs redness or irritation i can maneuver around the knees and ankles with no nicks it is a little pricey but so concentrated the price ends up being about the same as drug store brands
4	this makeup feels weird if i were rich i might buy it just to poke it with my finger it 's kind of fun that way it reminds me of a cold gel shoe insert it is very different it actually is a seaweed based product so it is mostly water with the pigment suspended in it this is the most natural looking makeup i 've ever worn the color is great i used bisque 5 on my fair skin usually i would go for an ivory but the bisque is what was offered it works great i suspect it will indeed work well over a variety of skin tones in the light to medium range because it is so very translucent i am aging and have some fine lines when i first wake up , and this does not do a thing for them in fact , it maybe makes them look a bit worse i think this product would be better on younger women it is non , and hypoallergenic , fragrance free and i like this one cruelty free it is made in japan the product comes in a container that looks a bit inexpensive at first glance , but when i consider it carefully , it is a container that is designed to keep the product very moist the container locks to a seal and has a pad at the top to help keep the moisture in the container stupid me did not know how to go about using it i did not read the ample instructions that came with it that 's just my style so i sat there this weird feeling makeup , , until i a hole right in the top of it i later found out that was a no no , but other than making it look ugly sitting in the container , the makeup is still working fine i 've put this on with my fingers , a bobbi brown stippling brush , and a sponge of all the methods i 've used , i like putting this particular one on with my fingers best besides the strange addiction i have with it , i actually found that using my fingers give me a very , very nice finish with this product there 's never a line of demarcation it just blends right in i do n't need powder either it 's just very natural , with great coverage that is really amazing considering how little pigment is actually going on your face it 's very unusual makeup it covers redness like a dream ! i developed some shine but only after about 4 hours this makeup lasts on me as long as the vincent longo blush does about 14 hours in cold weather that 's all i 've got to test it in , it will be interesting to see how it will do in georgia 's hot , humid summers i'm only giving it 4 stars though because it does n't do much to hide fine lines my face is fairly smooth but i do have those lines , and this product seems to settle in to them a bit and does nothing it might be better with primer but i did not test this with it , so i ca n't say i did use moisturizer under the product if your skin looks smooth and young , this foundation should even up your skin tone and make you look fabulous if discoloration and making your tone more even are n't your only concerns , you might want to try something else
5	good stuff ! when i first got into de shaving i tried all kinds of shave creams , soap etc after the dust settled and my wallet was empty i found the proraso shave soaps i find with a good badger brush and possibly a drop of shave oil this soap is all one needs for the perfect close shave ! i like the green proraso sometimes a bit better than this white and sometimes i prefer this white so i keep both on hand and alternate i find the value of this product is simply incredible with a badger brush i get fantastic , perfect lather and this product last many months before i need to order more i find using one drop of shave secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave ! i like the built in cup as i shave in the shower and with this plastic \( \) cup i can whip up a good later in no time
5	i have 2 pink cnd colors love them both for me , it 's a must have
5	great product
4	this is almost exactly what i love in my facial lotions i use glymed spf 30 the scent on this is that of regular body lotion , i am not fond of scents on my facial lotion i do love that there is spf 25 , i see an esthetician for peels and they have always told me that you should use spf i have had no problems with it leaving white on my face sometime the glymed cream needs to be rubbed in more than regular lotion due to spf this made my skin feel a tad oily and that is something else i did n't care for all in all , it 's okay , it 's not great i would keep using this but doubtful it would replace my glymed
3	i used them as directed , they stung a bit , but did n't seem to help i got them to help with ingrown hairs from my leg waxing i tried gently exfoliating with a cotton shower mitt and soap for sensitive skin and that helped more
5	works great , quality product !
5	i love cnd products all of them ! ! ! the vexed violette color is a light grayish plum color \( this is not a grape purple color \) this product is like all the other cnd shellac polishes wonderful ! it lasts for a full two weeks i have multiple colors and enjoy doing nail art , as well as just one color plain
5	best hand cream !
5	i have been using simple 's micellar cleansing wipes since they came out and this is an even better cleanser i am as to exactly how this product works , but it does a wonderful job of taking off every spot of makeup with one swipe i have dry , sensitive skin and this left my face feeling clean and fresh i normally wash my face after using the simple wipes but i found that this cleaned everything by itself with no need to really wash with cleanser i tend to over wash my skin which is n't great since it is so dry and this leaves it clean and a bit moisturized compared to using cleanser
5	note i 've changed my original rating from 4 stars to 5 stars because i 've found that after using juice beauty 's green apple age defy moisturizer for over a month , my face has noticeably brightened and become ultra smooth and hydrated i already liked this moisturizer and saw \( see original review below \) benefits after using it for just a week after a month , it 's benefits are more evident , and it 's become an essential component to my daily moisturizing routine this is my first time using a juice beauty product , and i'm impressed moisturizing is a twice a day standard in my routine i always put on bobbi brown 's eye moisturizer , and aveeno 's daily moisturizer with spf under my foundation however , i also now need to up my moisturizer for the brutally drying winter months , and this organic green apple antioxidant light moisturizer has already done several things very well it 's has soothed , plumped , and softened my skin , it 's worked well as a base for my liquid foundation , and it has minimized the pores across my nose , and evened out my skin tone in addition , it goes on easily with great coverage using a small amount , and it is n't greasy it sinks in very well on my face , and does n't creep down into my eyes it works well on my neck as well \( very soothing \) i do find that it does n't sink in as well on my dcollet , this is noticeable at shower time , when you can feel it sitting on the top layers of the skin \( does n't happen with the face and neck \) the light citrus woodsy scent is very nice glass jar with plastic top , provides easy access
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	this stuff is freaking incredible i love all of lrp 's products and their effaclar line is my holy grail skincare i have very fair skin and i'm prone to which was cute when i was younger but now i just see it as sun damage my derm recommended this to me back in the day but when i finally gave it a shot i was blown away yes , it 's pretty pricey but it absorbs so quickly , is incredibly lightweight , leaves no white cast or greasy oil slick and has a very non offensive smell , none of which can be said about most sunscreens i 've tried in recent years one bottle lasted me for ages and i will definitely repurchase once i decide to drag myself back out into the sun
5	this definitely worked to tighten my skin it also did n't cause any irritation the active ingredient is niacin which is popular in skin care products , sort of the it ingredient of the moment since this is a serum i followed up with a rich moisturizer and sunscreen and the combination worked well i did like the other niacin infused product i reviewed earlier better but this does get the job done too
2	the first thing i noticed is the scent or lack of it which to me , is a good thing too many products have scents that can compete with my perfume the product goes on easily and smoothly i use it in the morning before applying my foundation after using the base for 2 weeks , i do n't notice any significant difference my foundation may glide on a little easier but as for the overall look , no real improvement for the cost \( currently at 44 00 usd \) i would pass too expensive
4	this made my skin feel amazing , though i do have some mixed feelings about it , mostly due to my already oily skin in the past , i never would have considered putting additional oil on my face , but i heard such great things about this divine youth oil that i decided to try it it made my skin feel incredible ! so silky and smooth it really just automatically sinks into your skin and feels fabulous i feel like it gave my skin a little extra glow during the day \( i put it on at night \) and while it definitely added a little shine , too , it was a glow y shine that i did n't mind while some are saying the scent is way too strong , i actually thought it was lovely and i'm usually pretty sensitive to strong smells after using it for about a week and a half , i did start to break out more than i usually do however , i am pretty prone to breakouts , so i ca n't be certain it was due to the oil i stopped using it for a couple weeks and my skin is pretty clear now i 'll likely jump back into using it , but will avoid my breakout prone areas i will definitely report back after using for another extended time period !
5	i love , love , love opi 's nail envy i have always had thin , peeling nails that just would not stay strong enough to grow i 've been using this for about a month , and for the very first time in my entire 32 years of living , i had to trim down my nails because they were too long you read that right too long oh my god ! this product is a miracle worker in a bottle buy buy buy
5	just like other essence water products i have used i really like this water i apply as soon as i wake in the am and after removing my makeup \( and before my night moisturizer \) in the pm my face feels great and has never been cleaner and brighter after using for three weeks my face just looks awesome and i totally attribute to essence water products i have used in the spray bottle and i like this bottle better easier to use with a cotton swab love love love !
5	i have been suffering from severe what does this have to do with eye cream you may ask \? as a result , i have n't been eating or sleeping well and my eyes show it i have dark circles under my eyes and the wrinkles seem to be more pronounced i was intrigued by this eye creams claim to awaken and brighten why i like this product it works ! my eyes look brighter and less tired and this is just with using this eye balm and before i put on makeup it moisturizes without being really heavy and greasy it has no scent i have passed up countless skin creams because of their cloying , heavy and artificial scent i am happy to report that this cream has no scent it glides on the little pump works easily and dispenses just the right amount of balm to put under your eyes if you are looking for a product that will help you look less tired and more awake , this may just be for you
5	gave it as a gift they love it
3	seems a stiff price for what it is it goes on well , does n't leave any greasy feeling afterwards , and does help moisturize we live in , so the insanely dry air when it 's cold out really takes its toll on the skin and the lower humidity then in the house does n't help matters either but she found that while this worked fine , so do many other products with a less hefty price tag and as others have mentioned , we 've seen the same issue with the top not sealing very well
4	smells great ! ! works well
4	its been awhile since ive used primer and i thought id give this japonesque one a try its not kidding when it says its radiant its white and pearly and its like a layer of small bits of glitter are all over my skin if i do n't use much make up over it , its like im glowing i have freckles and some uneven color on my skin and i was hoping this primer would help even out my skin tone it doesnt really do much in that respect and i rely on my regular make up still , but it makes my foundation look better for longer i do n't feel so desperate to wash my face at the end of the day like i sometimes do without the primer it only takes a little bit of the primer to cover my face and this bottle will last a long time it has a little pump to get it out of the bottle , which im a big fan of to prevent bacteria from getting into the jar i think thats really important for make up i intend to use for more than a month or so like this one
5	beautiful shade
5	beautiful color , speedy delivery , and the merchant was very helpful and responsive i originally received this item defective , it was very tacky and thick , hard to put on i emailed him , and he sent a replacement immediately , which i also received quickly will definitely do business again ! ty ! !
5	great product , works great on sensitive skin does n't have a lot of fragrance which i like i first started using this when i got a facial , she sold the line
5	this is amazing for sun burns and for itchiness love this product
5	this cream is heavy , and stays on and moist until morning fixed up my dry winter skin , and i still use it just because , now that my skin is soft again i also use it on my knees and elbows
5	love , love , love pevonia products ! ! ! i truly recommend to anyone struggling with or other sensitive skin issues i have been using the lotion \( a calming astringent \) the botanical concentrate \( serum \) for over 10 years ! great prices too ! ! !
5	i love is clinical serums i 've tried several in the past , my favorites are pro heal , vit c e and 20 vit c they truly make a difference in skin appearance this serum has a hyaluronic acid \( hydrating , plumping \) and antioxidants plus mushroom extract it is tightening and feels good on the skin a little goes long way if your skin is dehydrated definitely it will help to use it under good occlusive moisturizer \( after cleanser and toner \) that will prevent loosing hydration from epidermis every skin can benefit from this serum as most of us has dehydrated dermis and epidermis if you need stronger anti aging properties or have a pigment issue or acne you can combine 2 serums or use one in the morning and another at night
5	great , it 's a great night time moisturizer and it 's helping my complexion along with the other pca products i am using
5	absolutely a beautiful color you wo n't regret your purchase i was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out and it was as described
5	this is exactly what i was looking for i have a curling wand by hot tools already so i knew the brand was great i love this curling iron it makes bigger curls which i wanted and it gets hot so you do n't have to leave it in the hair for long very smooth too the cord is super long like my other hot tools which is really nice
4	a wonderful lipstick wish it had a little more saturation very moist and easy to wear
4	this cleanser does a great job of getting your skin clean without stripping it and a small dab goes a long way in cleansing your face the only con i can find with this is that is has a weird scent to it not a deal breaker but it is strange
5	i suppose my review needs to be taken to meet the standards of the vine program , i had to review this in 30 days that 's a little less than what should be expected for full , noticeable results , but i certainly did use this as advised to some positive results this product does work it reduces wrinkles and stretch marks gradually i felt that massaging the cream onto my skin really made a difference it took about two weeks before i noticed any changes , but they were there this product is pricey and probably varies in effectiveness depending on skin tone but the question you 're probably asking yourself right now is whether or not this works the simple answer is yes it 's excellent at getting marks to fade i was very pleased with the results
1	this product arrived this afternoon i eagerly removed it for the box and began to pump away totally excited to try this new serum after many , many pumps , nothing happened i took the top off and instantly noticed that the straw that connects to the pump was missing this explains why no amount of pumping would result in any product i found a pack of in our junk drawer and gave the contents a little hoping to locate and that straw type device there was nothing in the bottle except for the serum with no way to get it out \( it is so thick that my shaking it , tapping it , and even it against my palm resulted in very little coming out \) from what i can , the smell is really nice , and it seems to have a lovely shimmer , but the person who gets a bottle similar to mine does it work \? i have no idea i cannot even get it out of the bottle what a weird quality control issue if i can locate any way to get this out of the bottle without contaminating it , i will update this review
5	i use this brand of yummy makeup and totally love it ! this bronzer is a matte sort of bronzer no sparkles which i kind of love it is quite a of a bronzer and i love the slide out mirror and brush ! it goes on evenly leaves my skin with a sun tanned glow and is perfect for travel i have a sort of olive tone to my skin so this color works perfectly for me this will be my bronzer for the rest of this summer ! i can not say enough about the size of this bronzer it 's not small at all ! just one more thing you can use this wet but that is n't what i like to do i just use it dry in places on my face where i would normally tan !
5	this is my second bottle of this color perfect for summer !
3	i 've used the hampton sun serious shimmer cooling spray pearl a couple of times now after using the hampton sun tanning gel it has a nice smell and a lot of shimmer sparkle being in my mid 40 's i'm not really interested in walking around looking like i'm sparkling the first thing i thought of when i saw this on my skin is that everybody would think i was a vampire because my skin sparkles in the sun this would probably be much better for somebody younger i really did n't notice a cooling effect nor did i think it made my tan look any better , but then again that may be because i did n't really like the sparkle effect
5	great stuff
4	nice little compact , can fit just about anywhere , your purse , your pocket very smooth , like velvet , goes on just a little or heavier if necessary does not cake and is good for dry skin though not greasy i apply it with my finger tips for just a little coverage , but you can use a makeup brush for better coverage a little pricey for such a small amount however , i like it !
5	love it
5	i am simply smitten with my recent \( how did i just learn of this ! ! \) discovery of vinylux i was once a fake nail girl expensive , time consuming , toxic and after a few years without , i to shellac i love it at first , but discovered it too hurt the nail , was somewhat time consuming , and i worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds this stuff is the bomb i dries super fast , no light required , and does last amazingly well my nails peel and chip within a day with regular polish this stuff is the bomb so happy i have n't kept it on a week yet it 's so quick and easy to change colors \( no soaking , just regular polish remover \) love it ! natural , quick , easy , beautiful super happy !
5	when i ordered this product from amazon vine i did not realize it was a male facial scrub while my husband was happy to have it , i decided to try it because i am the reviewer in the family \( his reviews consist of i like it and it 's good \) the first thing that i did was smell the product to see if it smelled manly it does n't it smells amazing it has a sweet almond smell that is addicting the scent could definitely work for either sex the scrub is in a form that spreads easily on your face , exfoliates and washes away easily this makes the whole face washing experience quick and easy i love the grittiness of the facial scrub it does an excellent job of both cleaning and exfoliating my face my oily skin feels clean afterwards and it does n't dry it out like some scrubs do i am really loving this facial scrub and i have pretty much it from my husband it has replaced my st ives apricot scrub for the moment i do not know if i will purchase it again because of the price however , given the choice between the two i would use this baxter scrub i like the scent and feel better i would recommend this exfoliating scrub if you do n't mind paying the price for it
4	been using this for years to hide my scalp spots works great !
1	this product is pretty much everything i hate about high end cosmetics rolled into one annoying applicator they create a fancy cute delivery system when a regular tube would have been easier and better , the company makes claims and creates fancy words that sound rich and effective , but down to basic old time ingredients that are easily purchased for much less in other brands basically this is titanium dioxide with some nice added scents titanium dioxide has this great reflective property and opacity they add it to light colored paints to make them opaque and reflective giving a room a brighter look used as a makeup primer you can get the same effect , it reflects light to make your face look brighter and more youthful , and also adds an opaque mask to somewhat hide blemishes without having to add a bunch of heavy foundation over the top it also has the added bonus of being a decent sunscreen many of the mineral makeup companies use this naturally occurring mineral the downside to titanium dioxide is that in flash photos it white which can lead to some weird results \( do a google search on titanium dioxide makeup photos and you 'll see a variety of movie stars showing this effect \) so , why use it \? because it has a long history of human use and is considered very safe , as opposed to some of the more recent chemical based sunscreens , and it requires much less product to achieve opacity next question is why should you pay more money for this particular iteration when you can purchase something similar at your local drugstore for less than a third the price \? i 've used nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href physicians formula mineral wear talc free mineral correcting primer green 0 5 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 physicians formula mineral wear talc free mineral correcting primer , green , 0 5 ounce a nbsp for a few years and think it works well to hide redness and other minor skin issues it goes on light , does n't feel oily , and seems to keep my makeup in place a few hours longer bliss mad about goes on a little heavier and feels a little tacky when wet once dried it does n't add any heaviness and feels sort of powdery , it also seems to keep my makeup in place a few hours longer in use , i see no difference between these two products , and the physicians formula does a better job at reducing redness and evening out my skin tone third question is , if a company ca n't even get the bottle right , why should i trust the product \? this is 1 oz of product in a container weighing over 2 ounces , that has an applicator that wo n't allow you to access the all of the product unless you break the container , but that 's not the worst issue i have with it the tube has a major manufacturing flaw the on points the wrong direction , meaning when you twist the cap to on , the container is closed twist to off and you may be able to squeeze out a thread thin stream of product or maybe not if the tip gets even slightly clogged it 's nearly impossible to get things going again so , does it work \? yes , but there are other products available at less than a third the cost that are the same or better , and even at that cheap price they actually have an applicator that works !
1	my husband has been using toppik for awhile now it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head , which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair and in the sun , it actually turns a pinkish red \( he uses dark brown \) ! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie even with a bit of wind or humidity , the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face , making it look like tar it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still do n't know that he uses the product ! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind , constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product , and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it does n't even bother me , my husband constantly obsesses over his hair instead of enhancing his look , toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place instead of boosting his confidence , toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair
5	feels great ! although not a miracle cure , the product feels very refreshing on my skin is a little tighter , but it gives it a polished look , and a very soft touch , both of which i really enjoy the directions say to use daily , and not to use on the face there is a lingering rose petal scent , but it 's soft and perfect for spring i usually do not like any floral smells and this does not see to bother me while on also surprisingly , i had no reaction to this serum i am a redhead , with fair and very sensitive skin , and usually have some kind of mild reaction to most products i have used this product every other day for two weeks and there were no redness , itchiness or heat blotches that occurred
4	i 've had some skin surgeries for cancer cells around my face and this helped with some of the areas that were cut and the skin stretched over it also seems to have improved the wrinkles on the back of my hands it 's funny how you first notice getting old , i was only in my late teens or maybe it was early 20 's when i noticed the tips of my fingers started to have some lines in them it really me at the time seeing even moderate aging i can relate to how some women and men take drastic steps to retain their youth as a man , i'm not to vain about most things , graying hair , glasses , not able to do the physical things i could 30 years ago having something that helps your skin and save it from premature aging is a good thing i 've seen pictures of and in person those sun types , that look haggard and saggy from sun damage and dry skin some even in their 30 's look downright awful this works with a combination of nutrition , vitamins , oils and other things to strengthen the skin and keep it moist i ca n't complain about any of the contents and they appear to have done a good job blending them together in one effective compound it is expensive , a small tube costs a lot of money , but many of the things that work are i decided to let my sister have some of this stuff , and she posted a picture on , which i 've attached here fyi , my sister turns 61 in june , so she was quite pleased with the result , i think she 's going to save up for more , for her this is probably a five star product !
5	i love essie nail polish ! it 's my favorite brand and one of the brands i buy most love this color !
5	edited i love this blush so much i ended up buying the peony shade for the days i want a pinker blush i love this it reminds me of nars o with only a tiny hint of shimmer it goes on very sheer but is build able without being too powdery looking i'm a fair cool and blossom is a very subtle shade i ca n't imagine anyone medium or darker being able to wear this it 's so pale i love that it has no fragrance i used to wear covergirl when i was younger but the overly perfumed scent bothers me now the compact is fairly large considering it 's blush and includes a mirror in the lid
4	as an aa woman this blends and cover very well i have a significant birthmark on my face and dermablend covers it completely without flaking , caking , and rubbing off on my clothes
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	i tend to prefer the taylor of old bond street soaps , but the v76 by is a great for those using a safety razor it 's clean and refreshing , sufficiently and makes for a great shave i recommend this this shaving gel
5	my wife likes this night cream and has had positive results regarding its exfoliation properties upon washing her face in the morning , she indeed has evenness of tone the company , vichy laboratories , claims on its site that clinical research shows 35 1 reduction of intensity of visible dark spots the instructions provide two ways to use the cream as a night cream and as a facial mask my wife uses it as a night cream
4	good polish
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
3	i 've been using this filler for a few weeks and i have n't noticed any improvement in the lines between my nose and mouth the instructions say to apply the cream and then allow it to dry once the cream is dry it does feel like my skin is tighter and the lines are less visible the drying cream seems to pull the skin , and makes the wrinkles less visible but once i start to apply my moisturizer and makeup , the filler absorbs the moisture and my skin relaxes back into its normal wrinkles so works for a few minutes , but does n't have staying power
5	love this stuff !
5	i have the body wash shampoo conditioner from the same company the same tobacco smell my wife loves it ! it 's a different texture than most gels not too heavy and not really sticky it feel and looks like a blend of petroleum jelly and waxy stuff , yet it 's water soluble i love the jar ideas you can take it to work or to the gym with out it messing up other things in your bag
5	my favorite new shade for summer ! turns out gorgeous and bright even without a white base could n't be happier with it !
4	nice color my wife likes how easy it went on not too bright not too plain a cool natural tone for every day
4	i have used many different lash curlers over the years , so i decided to give this new one a try i thought it was just okay it was serviceable , but there is nothing special about it that i would recommend over any of the others i have used for years
5	when you have older skin \( i am 60 \) the line between really clean and overdrying is very slim older skin is less resilient and prone to be far more fragile than when younger i really like the product i 've been using it for days and my skin feels in that sweet zone of clean but not tight and drawn the product does not really lather but you mix it with water in your hand to cleanse the scent to me is like the and is refreshing \( and like home to this girl \) i love the container with its dispenser cover and careful pump i'm sold i 'll be buying it when this container runs out very pleased
5	this brush works fantastically it magnetically charges , so remains sealed and thus waterproof it has a single setting , but that single setting is plenty to get your face nice and clean and smooth the brush is way softer than i expected \( softer even than most \) , but does a really really good job cleaning
5	love my cnd !
2	in my personal opinion , color is good to be used as base for another one did n't like it using it alone very solid color , no glossy or pearl like finish
5	perfect pedicure color
5	i love this brand but was n't sure about an oil on my face i love the way the oil smells and my face looks and feels very hydrated it 's amazing what happens to wrinkles when the skin is plump ! i have gotten a lot of compliments on looking fresh and happier from friends this past week i can only attribute these compliments to my skin looking better than normal !
4	smells good , lathers well and does a good job
4	great eyeliner ! does the job without being too finicky i find that it 's harder to apply when cold out , so i will the tip in my to warm up the pencil i also use this for my eye brows no smudging lasts all day
5	the color is very beautiful ! ! !
5	out of all the skin care products i 've ever tried , the neovadiol line from vichy is my favorite i always use their wonderful oil and find that the cream and this day cream work wonders on my skin this is a thick , a little bit goes a long way , creamy moisturizer that works and keeps my skin smooth for hours and it also does well under make up this is a good cream to hydrate skin and takes the focus out of fine wrinkles i love the neovadiol line i ca n't say enough good about it for skin , especially for over 50 skin this is just a wonderful product and i highly recommend the vichy neovadiol oil oh man , that stuff is wonderful for plumping and hydrating my skin this in conjunction with the oil works makes skin smooth and soft all day
5	the julep nail polish goes on smoothly the color on my nail is exactly the color it appeared in the bottle the nail polish is vegan and made in the u s a i applied only one coat and it took three days before chipping started by day six , the color was thinning out some and the tips of the nails were showing wear that is without touch ups , without an undercoat , or a top coat so the color lasts well the packaging is really nice too it looks very high end they have a label on the top of the bottle brush that says switch me it is for you to put some of the nail polish on there so that when you store your bottles you can see the color right on top without having to pull the bottle out it is a really nice feature i wish all companies did this of course since it 's on the brush part of the bottle you need to use a q tip to apply the color onto the label , but that 's no big deal i got the color classic with a twist it a grayish color with purple undertones my spouse really liked the color it looks very chic i have nothing negative to say about this nail polish the picture below shows the packaging compared to the color on the nail and a picture of the swatch on top
5	i use to only find this product line in doctors offices only so glad i can just order it this product really gets the skin clean and makes your skin tingle , just be careful this is strong stuff and you may have some dryness if you over use it just take your time and develop some to it i would not recommend to some one with super skin
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	a very mild toner that did n't my skin i 'd bet it would work for just about any skin type it left my skin feeling nice , refreshed , and clean , and has a nice scent that would work well for men or women
5	great product
5	great brush overall it is very soft and distributes makeup nicely !
5	my son used some of this hand cream when i had it and is now a daily user and fan i bought him some as a surprise he has very dry and chapped hands this cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet good stuff !
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
3	the picture shows it kind of pinkish , at least on my screen i knew it would n't be the exact color pictured all products differ at least slightly from the picture but it 's really a pale brown color instead of anything even along the pink spectrum i 'll still wear it , but i was really hoping for a neutral pink color , and instead i got a brown that wo n't match much of what i wear i'm rather upset that it is n't what i expected , and i really do n't much like the color
5	wonderful color
5	great price arrived on time works as advertised
5	i love the huge pump bottle for this amazing product the pump is easy to use and the product goes on smoothly this oil is just what my skin needed after being trapped under all those layers of clothes all winter , it 's itchy and in need of some serious moisturizer this does the trick in the shower and does n't feel greasy or slimy it imparts moisture to my skin and does n't leave a film there ca n't actually be a person out there that ca n't benefit from using this my skin is me for this
5	i have somewhat sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and drying if i use the wrong products i picked this cleanser up after reading the positive reviews i use it for daily cleansing and so far it is a great product for me it cleanses well , does not leave behind any oily residue , is lightly scented and leaves my skin feeling tightened but in no way irritated since i only wear very light make up occasionally , i have asked my daughter to try it for a week and let me know her thoughts i will update this review with her input highly recommended for those with sensitive skin
4	love the color , perfect for summer it 's a little on the thin side , which i find is usual for essie colors , but multiple coats leaves you with a solid , light coral color
3	i received this foundation in the shade , not buff i really was hoping for a but it did n't work for me the foundation comes with an odd shaped dropper it does n't take much of the serum to cover your face i was hoping it would be lighter coverage this looked too cakey and sort of dry on me i'm a fan of bliss , but the serum foundation did n't look good on me
5	love opi !
4	now , mind you , i'm testing this in april may , not the really humid summer months here in florida , so i may have to edit this review in two or three months if this product does n't hold its own against serious florida weather however , we 've had some days already into the 90 degrees with a lot of humidity , so i 've got a pretty good idea of what this chi silk infusion can do there are several things i like about this 1 \) leaves hair shiny and soft 2 \) actually does help straighten out the waves and curls , even without a flat iron 3 \) smells rather pleasant a lot like a cologne an ex man in my life used \( i asked my husband if the scent was familiar to him and he said no , so this must have been in b h times before husband \) 4 \) only requires a dime to nickel sized dab , depending on how long and how voluminous your hair is more is actually not a good idea causes less shine and less softness in my case 5 \) even seems to add a bit of body to my hair my only reservation about the product is all the chemical ingredients in this i hope they 're safe for people and for the environment because it 's one of the best leave in treatments i 've found for my frizzy grey hair
4	the color is darker than we expected based only on the image provided on amazon however , the narrow width and long , thin tube is easier to control , for us , than traditional , short , thicker , tubes particularly for thinner lips , this lipstick can be a much better way to apply lipstick than lipstick in a traditional tube the lipstick applies easily and smoothly as noted above , with the thinner barrel , it is easier to control application , so the smooth application helps control even more the finish is a bit more matte than we anticipated if more shine is desired , try applying a light layer of lip balm over the top of the lipstick on the other hand , in a bright environment the finish should be less reflective , which can be desirable for many reasons generally , we like this lipstick the ease of control for smaller hands , the smooth application , and the bright color are all positive features the only issue we have is the price , which we consider a bit high for lipstick however , the price is somewhat consistent with other , high end lipsticks , and though we are always amazed at the prices of high end makeup , this lipstick seems to work a bit better and last longer than discount store lipstick does this lipstick work so much better than discount store lipstick that it is worth two or three times the price of discount store lipstick \? for us , the price is too high to buy this lipstick for routine use , but it may be a great lipstick for a gift and for special occasions enjoy !
5	good shampoo i enjoy this brand a lot they do not test on animals always nice quality product as well i have curly hair gentle on it
4	if you love the light , clean scent of roses , you will love this the lotion consistency is perfect not too thick and not too thin it absorbs into the skin quickly without being sticky or too thick like other crabtree and evelyn products , the floral scent is perfected to be both subtle and long lasting at the same time this is excellent as a daily moisturizer but its not thick enough , in my opinion , to work well on really dry places like heels or elbows but its good for everything else , especially hands this lotion actually made my dry winter hands look so much better its a large bottle \( with a pump \) so it will last a good long time recommend
5	buy directly from pca
1	i am not happy with the product because it is n't the item i actually wanted to buy i meant to purchase the pevonia rs2 lotion \( i do n't use the cleanse \) but your company wo n't let me return exchange it for the correct one
5	absolutely loved this lip treatment i typically use moisturizers on my face , but i guess i never thought of how my lips probably are one of the first areas that show my age this cream is a smoothing addition to my daily beauty regimen now i use it at night before bed and in the morning when i wake up i can honestly say that after using this for almost two weeks now , the results are amazing i see my lips looking fuller \( i typically have thin lips \) and the skin around them is smoother if there is any down size it 's the size of the product and the cost i mean , i will probably be through this little jar in less than a month not sure i will spend 60 a month or so for this but , maybe in this case , you do get what you pay for
5	excellent foundation very light going on and very hydrating , gives you a nice glow i find the coverage to be light to medium perfect for the summer the only downside , for me , is that i tend to get very shiny about half way through the day i keep a light setting powder with me to keep this under control
5	love this rose oil for a daily face refresh and i also love to toss it in my wet hair and let my hair dry naturally for beachy waves great product
5	i love dermablend cover creme and have been using it for ages , at least a decade it lasts a long , long time it is easy to apply , goes on smoothly , does n't collect in wrinkles , and stays true to color it comes off relatively easily with almost any makeup remover and a soft cloth i love the colors , although i did make a couple of mistakes in finding just the right one the off colors i got can still be used in different seasons though i highly recommend this smooth , fine , long lasting foundation
5	any girl that has a sephora obsession has tried a few jack black samples it 's a high end line , with dozens of products touting botanical ingredients that offer real results men love them because they are n't frou frou and fussy , and we all like men that take care of themselves this stuff is downright delicious with a soft natural mint freshness not so much that you a peppermint , just enough to feel refreshed leaves hair soft and sexy
5	i purchased this in the hopes that i would be able to do a french nail tip on my nails they are not long enough yet but soon will be with the shellac process i tried this out and think it will be great in conjunction with the brushes goes on smooth as glass ! update i did try this out and even being an amateur my nails looked presentable this is the perfect color if you want the white french nail tips
5	great product ! does n't make me break out i even went back to my old foundation to see if it really made a difference and i broke out again if you are really unsure about your shade call jane iredale customer service they sent me a free tiny sample to try since i do n't live close to a location
5	essie cartel blue is a deep , rich navy blue it 's perfect for any time of the year
4	this is a pretty muted purple pink with an iridescent purple running through it it has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque
5	i received lots of compliments on the color this nail polish is long lasting and shiny it is so quick and easy to apply full manicure , set and dried , in 30 minutes !
5	love this face sunscreen i have tried so many brands and have found them to be so greasy , it was impossible to keep my foundation from coming off or just looking like a greasy mess this has a wonderful fresh smell and goes on like a light cream , not greasy one bit
5	great quality ! love this bronzer pros bronze color \( nor orange \) , a little goes long way , nice scent , great ingredients cons maybe price \? but considering all the pros it 's ok , it will last a while i use mix a tiny bit with my zinc oxide sunscreen and it is perfect ! not only i do n't look like a ghost , have the best protection \( zinc oxide is the only thing that protects from , and uvb \) but it blurs imperfections \( evens out the skin tone \) it 's perfect for making winter lighter foundation a summer one , when we slightly darker or use more self tanners it last on the skin until i remove it with soap and water \( from the body \) or face cleanser
5	busy mom i like that i can get great quality beauty products without trying to take my kids into the beauty store
2	polish chips very easily love the color
2	i like the sound of a cologne that smelled like sweet tobacco and spirits , but my immediate impression was of strong musky vanilla smell not terribly manly , , and incredibly strong also i'm not terribly impressed with the tacky sticker label , and cheap bottle the sprayer is not sealed , it was quite loose on the glass , so when the bottle arrived , part the box was soaked looking at the sprayer , it was permanently and was and slightly loose i was not able to get it off , but i could turn and wiggle it a bit terribly cheap stuff , but on the other hand if you like it , it will go a long way this is a massive size for a man 's perfume bottle , and it takes very little a single spray would be about 10x too much , imo , so you might want to spray it onto a tissue , and then dab sparingly on your collar do not put it on your skin , as the smell is impossible to wash off it absorbs into your skin it 's been an entire day after i washed my hands a dozen times and i can still smell it
5	works surprisingly well
5	i buy it for my friend and she love it , when i see my friend it become the her face become
4	good color
3	i have used this for a while , i ca n't tell the difference between this and vaseline intensive care skin cream the reviews are great , maybe i have the wrong skin for it it was not hydrating enough
2	wears off and chips easily lasts about 2 days
5	i love this cleansing cream , smells great
3	i bought this after getting a facial where they used bioelements products in the beginning i used it in the morning and bioelements sleepwear in the evening even though i have oily skin , my face ended up having a shiny appearance by the end of the day i discontinued this \( and switched back to my original daytime moisturizer \) but still wear the bioelements sleepwear at night and that seems to be a better combination so no , i'm not crazy about this product
4	the mario badescu rose hips nourishing oil is a very small bottle of facial oil the oil is intended to reduce flaky and dry skin the way to use it is to use a couple of drops and massage them into skin prior to applying your usual moisturizer the product does n't remain sticky or heavy it is absorbed quickly and does n't leave skin looking shiny or oily after reading the ingredient list , i realized like others that this product really is n't an oil but a rose hip extract in a base of propylene glycol and glycerin even so , i do notice a benefit from using it as directed skin is less dry with a more even complexion overall i would still recommend this product for its properties it goes on easily and is non irritating , even with my very sensitive skin
5	loooove it !
5	no here this face lotion did not break me out like other anti aging lotions i have used in the past it is a medium thick consistency , goes on with no pulling or tugging \( some thicker creams can do \) it leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft after it absorbs fully into my skin it does not have any scent to it \( that i can tell \) i not noticed any changes in my life but sometimes that can take up to 6 8 weeks and really , at 36 i have very fine lines right now i will definitely keep using at this point , it gives excellent moisture to my skin which is always better than keeping your skin dry
4	i was looking for a soft orange or coral color to balance my growing cnd gel polish collection , which is a bit red pink heavy i thought this color would be perfect well i'm going to keep looking as desert poppy is more a warm and bright pink than a mild orange i am dark skinned african american and this color still works for me but the advertised photo is somewhat misleading i would still recommend this product but not if you are looking for a noticeably orange color however , i will add that there is a delicate sparkle when i look at this color in sunlight and i 've had coworkers identify this color on me as coral , so to each her own !
4	this is a great basic brown pencil it 's soft enough not to tug , but does make for a less precise line smudges easily , but stays well enough for the price i'm not sure i 'll repurchase , since a lot of eyeliners are more pigmented and just as creamy with a longer wear time for the same price point but , for a decent basic this is a good one bonus , this shade does double duty really well as an eyebrow pencil too !
5	amazing ! ! wo n't work on a bald head , but if you have thinning hair then it 's unbelievable
4	i have the julep charcoal konjac sponge and am addicted this is almost the exact same but a different color it 's a really gentle exfoliation which is great for sensitive skin i was hoping for a green tea scent or otherwise spa experience but sadly there is none
4	i really like this hand cream it goes on smoothly and does reduce the lines in my hand it just takes a small amount and that is a good thing as it is a really small tube and sells for 12 at tube if you like natural products this is one for you
5	this is a very small bottle \( think travel sizes \) but thankfully a little goes a long way like other mario badescu products , the liquid looks thick but feels smooth and non greasy once you rub it into your skin the best part is that it has spf 15 , which means i can use this as sunscreen , not just moisturizer spf 15 is good for everyday use , when you do n't expect to be exposed to a lot of heat and sunshine , but you still want something to protect your face when you go out for work or casual walks i appreciate the fact that it does n't have a strong scent except for the price \( which i think is a little high for a small bottle \) , i like the feel of it on my skin
5	i use several bio element products i like this one when i know i 'll be outdoors playing tennis but do n't get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn i'm 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and spf so i would recommend but not if you have oily skin i , pat it on from my forehead to my chest
5	i'm very pleased with this brush while i do n't think i 'll be using it very frequently i do like how it was able to smooth out my skin , almost like getting a mini facial it is a harsh brush compared to the others i have which is why i 'll be saving it to just use from time to time after using it my skin was fairly red so i would n't use it unless you 'll be home for the day or are heading to bed , my skin had calmed down by the morning and i was able to put makeup on at that point all in all this brush is a nice addition to a skin care set for those looking for a deep clean
4	so , tiny knives like this have been around for awhile , usually from or similar brands i 've never seen anything else from this particular manufacturer but the quality seems on par that 's about the best i can say for it every tool works , though the nail clippers are n't that useful for my man
5	this is a beautiful , sparkly deep red , good for holidays , or anytime one of my all time i recommend using a light base color as the first coat
5	i'm a retin a user and long time lover of obagi products since my former was as a paramedical aesthetician \( i have a , recognized around the world \) this product did not cause any sensitivity even though i'm using a 1 \( the highest \) retin a gel on my skin daily clear fx is an aha based cream \( in this case , lactic acid \) that helps cells turn over more rapidly to reveal clearer , less blotchy looking skin typically , some aha acids do make my skin a bit irritable at times , but this product did n't , i will continue to use it since it will take some time to see actual results \( i 'll update my review in a month 's time to report any changes in my skin \) i'm very excited to have the opportunity to use this product and do whatever i can to clear up the discoloration on my skin since i'm familiar with dr obagi 's line , i can tell you that this is indeed an authentic product companies do change or upgrade their packaging at times , and that seems to be the case here i compared this product with one from a med spa i formerly worked at and it checks out just fine this product does n't have any fragrance to speak of , there is a very light scent that dissipates immediately i love that this cream is readily absorbed into my skin , and does n't leave a residue since i like to wear sunblock \( at the very least on my minimalist days \) and makeup i plan on using this during the day , and my retin a gel at night as i usually do only a small amount of product is needed , and it 's best to focus on areas of discoloration and avoid any areas that you know are sensitive on your face \( for me it 's around the eye and nostril area , i tend to peel there \) realize that this product will make your skin sun sensitive , you need a good sunblock as a companion for this product regardless of the time of day when it 's used this is the case with any glycolic or other type of acid \( such as citric vit c \) products as a skin care professional , i highly recommend trying a test patch on your skin if you tend to be sensitive i honestly think this is a good idea even if you have sturdy skin when exploring powerful products like the obagi line , i always suggest a visit with a skin care professional as well , preferably one with a paramedical \( or med spa \) background working with physicians such as dermatologists or plastic surgeons powerful skin care is unlike typical otc or department store lines , they actually do work on the skin , so may cause side effects , if not used properly tip if you have skin or it happens to be around your cycle \( which can cause temporary sensitivity \) , make certain to wait at least 15 min after washing your face before applying this cream i do plan to update this review when enough time passes to see results , or if i should have any issues with this product just in case you 're wondering what 's in this product , i will list the ingredients \( also listed in the product description here amazon \) if you have inflammatory acne , proceed with caution see if you can try a sample \( may be available from the company or various cosmetic like sephora \) to test on your skin before purchase ingredients water , arbutin , cetyl alcohol , glycerin , sodium lauryl sulfate , stearyl alcohol , tocopheryl acetate , ascorbic acid , , sodium , bht , lactic acid , disodium edta , butylparaben , methylparaben , propylparaben active ingredient arbutin via wikipedia extract is used in skin lightening treatments designed for long term and regular use an active agent in brands of skin lightening preparations , it is more expensive than traditional skin lightening ingredients like hydroquinone , which is now banned in many countries in studies of human exposed to arbutin at concentrations below 300 g ml reported decreased activity and melanin content with little evidence of 5 arbutin is a a hydroquinone extracted from the plant in the it and thus prevents the formation of melanin arbutin is therefore used as a skin lightening agent arbutin is found in wheat , and is concentrated in pear skins it is also found in 1 arbutin was also produced by an in culture of chinensis 2 obagi has a very professional staff on their site that can answer any questions you might have about their products , they have helped me out on more than one occasion and i 've always had a good experience with the company \( located in , ca \) if i can answer any questions , please feel free to leave a comment and i 'll do my best so far , this product has earned a well deserved 5 stars and i'm looking forward to clearer , more glowing skin ! update it' 's one day shy of a month so i wanted to update my skin looks much better and has a new glow melasma discoloration is better and even my birthmark \( caused by delivery \) on my face is a bit lighter \( that 's a first with any product \) overall , my skin has a more even color and tone i did n't experience any irritation from this product i will continue to use this , especially since summer is coming and i tend to get discoloration on the 's of my face , even with sunblock i stand by my original review \( and 5 star rating \) and still feel this is an excellent product , it fulfills it 's promise in reducing blotchy discolored skin
5	i really like this fragrance it 's relatively muted and i feel that it leaves a rich aroma kind of interesting that some reviews comment on the longevity of the product understand that this product is a eau de toilette eau de toilette sprays are 5 15 and last typically for about 3 hours a perfume is 15 20 and can last for 5 8 hours , so know what you 're buying and how long you want your fragrance to last the bottle itself has a nice black leather wrap the spritz is not a huge blast , which i 've found to be an issue in some sprayer bottles you will not be overpowered with one shot i typically spray into the air and walk into the spritz so it 's not too much do this in my , mainly aiming for the base of the neck and chest area this allows products to combine with your natural , producing a unique scent which is only you a dab under your ears is great when your date is leaning in close to you if you have dry skin , you can use a bit more since your skin absorbs more of the product i 'll just say that i like the scent , colognes smell differently on everyone for the reason i mentioned above so it 's not much point getting too much into the layers of the product which the manufacturer has already laid out
5	perfection this is perfect for setting my makeup as well as a refresher throughout the day !
5	i have impossible hair thinning dry frizzy gross if i use this with an oil like davines or the oribe it actually looks soft and curly great product took me awhile to figure it out
5	great nude color for everyday wear
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	i use this under foundation that has no spf i do n't notice a tint , actually , even before i put the foundation on however , spf wise , it works great ! i also add some to my neck area , as well i still have over half left a month or two later definitely a very nice luxury skin care item that 's a good option versus drugstore brands i like it with foundation because it 's so very light on my skin , and it does n't feel greasy it also has n't messed up my makeup , either ! when i do n't wear full makeup , i use this as a simple grab and go primer with just some lip liner
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
4	my skin feels very clean and soft after washing not tight the smell is a little too strong in the beginning though , but once i washed it off it 's ok
3	was n't blown away by this product i have fine , medium length hair and find that this product weighs it down and makes it slightly greasy it 's also a really hard clay , and kind of a pain to get out of the jar and then spread it out in your hands i would consider wearing to a short event if i needed a lot of hold and shine to my hair , but for all day wear i find that my hair just feels incredibly greasy by the end of the day might work better on short haircuts , but for a side part \( think hair 2 5 4 inches in length \) i would recommend something a little more pliable , like a grooming cream or even a softer wax , like bumble and bumble
5	this really is a different type of cream my husband and i used this on various areas of itchy , cracked skin and also some small patches of wounds it has a different texture and consistency from any cream i 've used it 's not greasy , yet thick and moist i'm not sure if it anything , but there is some relief now and hope to discover significant results after a few months
4	the sultra the bombshell rod curling iron i really like i am able to quickly and easily achieve the styles for my hair that i was hoping to get from a styling tool such as this for the higher price tag , i assumed this would have a few more features like beeping when i 've held a curl long enough \( 8 seconds per instructions \) or an option to adjust the heat but it does n't because it does n't have these features , i am taking a a star off just because i feel for the price these important and somewhat expected features should have been the features this curling iron does have is that it heats up very quickly , there 's a 9 foot no tangle swivel cord , an auto shut off safety feature , and it 's light weight included is a styling glove and an iron pad to rest the iron on when needing to place it down while styling your hair my hair is very long it 's thick and normally quite wavy that being said , i do have to spend some time on my hair for certain styles i typically use this iron to achieve a few ringlets here and there but not all over the results come out great when paired with heat protection sprays applied first the curling iron is easy to use there is one power switch which goes up and down i e off and on i have n't accidentally bumped it off when styling since there is no adjustable heat settings , there 's nothing else to with you simply wait about a minute and the iron is ready to use when styling it 's important to use the glove so you do n't accidentally burn yourself when wrapping and getting to the last bit of that hair to curl my fingers get pretty close to the heating unit so i am glad the glove is included the amount of time needed for each curl to set will fully depend on how much hair your grab at once if it 's a smaller , thinner amount i would suggest 8 seconds but it 's a thicker amount 15 seconds may be better there will be trial and error to find what best works so a learning curve is necessary i can style my hair with this tool and results can last for a couple of days i am quite pleased with the look i get and how no brainer this tool is to use i did n't get any weird bumps or things like others have mentioned in their reviews i am including pictures of my waves and ringlets with my post so you can see the results i got there is a two year warranty on this product which is great for the money you 'll be shelling out on it i feel the price is reasonable for the high quality hair styling you can achieve the product is solid and does what it should minus a few features i hope they 'll add to their next model
4	i like this bare nail color again , no shine upon drying and it dries very quickly you absolutely need to add a shine nail product to this i use opi infinite shine 3 awesome product
4	i like this product because you spray it on your face and it sets your makeup it makes it stay solidly
5	love this , good makes my skin smooth and smells divine also wonderful big foam bubbles if you use it in the bath
5	this is a high end luxury brush that truly delivers there are two things you need to know when you 're ready to buy a mason pearson brush of any sort one is the size full size \( the largest size \) , handy \( medium sized \) , or pocket \( the smallest size \) this is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept \( say , in your handbag \) , but because of the bristle length of the various sizes the smaller sizes have shorter bristles the bristles have to be able to reach your scalp , and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair if you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair , you 'd do better with a larger size the other consideration is the bristle type do you want all nylon , like this detangler \? even though the detangler is all nylon , some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter , just like the mixed bristle brush it 's hard to see in the picture you should know that the detangler is the only mason pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair all of the larger mason pearson brushes , including this one , come with a bristle brush , so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush the detangler is a brush just like the other brushes , not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing it is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also even though my hair is very short , it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick this handy size is about eight inches long it 's quite a large expense to buy any mason pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items it 's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment but it 's worth it if you 're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie , then you can justify the cost that 's how we did it \) for additional information on mason pearson visit their web site at masonpearson dot com highly recommended
5	love the color
5	lacoste offers an elegant , and sophisticated perfume from the appearance of the bottle to the fragrance , it proves classy and up to the standards of the best evening out or professional gathering it is a perfect gift for a woman who wears perfume and is open to trying to fragrances this subtle and pleasant scent should draw the right kind of attention a touch goes a long way with this scent this bottle should last a significant time and make it a worthwhile investment in fragrance
5	i love this brush i hesitated to buy it because of the price but it is so worth the money my hair no longer gets that stringy look midday , but stays full of volume with tons of shine all day i ca n't believe how much difference a brush can make it also works perfect for adding a little back combing \( brushing \) and then smoothing the top i wish i had gone for the most expensive mason brush , but for now i will just enjoy this one
5	this is amazing ! i had tried so many other top rated eye creams , moisturizers and even vaseline , but this actually keeps my eye area moist , but not greasy , all day or overnight , per application i do n't use it on my upper eye area in the day , so maybe it would interfere with makeup , but it stays put on my under eye area , and does n't smudge any under eye liner it does n't irritate my eyelid skin , or sting it has vitamin c and other anti aging goodies , but it 's too soon to see any effects there is a lot of peer reviewed research supporting the efficacy of these ingredients , but i do n't know if this is formulated so that the benefits would be realized but la roche posay is a reputable company , so probably i like that it is in an air tight , opaque tube with a tiny tip i can dispense just as little as i want , and the rest stays fresh and pro tip you need to unscrew the tip the first time , it and press in to the foil seal if there were instructions on how to do this , i missed them
5	this is the first product from oribe i 've tried , and i really like it ! i'm growing out my wavy hair , and it 's just past my shoulders this helps create definition to the ends , and it it also does n't have any smell , and is free from nasty i follow the curly girl method of no silicones and no sulfates , and this does n't have any of those i also have n't had any of the problems that other reviewers have had of it making my hair look wet , but i only apply about a half pea size amount to my fine hair if you check the oribe hair care channel on youtube , you 'll also find a helpful video on how to use this
5	dj play that song is a semi neon purple color with red undertones i say semi because it 's not a blazing neon it can be worn to work it looks just like it is pictured in the bottle pinkish purple i tried to take pics after applying but my camera would n't capture the real color i tried in sun shade indoors lights but did n't work the color is really pretty to naked eye saturday disco fever is a bright pure orange color this is not a very blazing neon , so i am able to wear it to work it looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors i felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in summer i was a little apprehensive at first because i personally do n't like yellow orange shades but this color worked for me it is more red toned than yellow toned this dark orange looks good on nails too the formula on both the polishes is great two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish they dry quickly but dry matty ish so top coat is a must for me i applied a base coat \( opi base coat \) , 2 coats of polish and a top coat \( opi top coat \) they lasted more than a week on me which is rare \)
5	strivectin eye concentrate really works ! i was concerned about puffiness and wrinkling , especially under my eyes i was surprised when this cream actually lessened the appearance of these problems ! i was not sure that it would work , because it seems very light and absorbs quickly however , i saw a marked difference immediately after using this product another wonderful thing about this eye cream is that i had no allergic reaction i have sensitive skin , and many cosmetics and creams cause me problems it actually brightens the appearance of my under eye area , reducing the puffiness there is no noticeable scent this is a larger tube than eye cream usually comes , so the price is not bad , when compared to others i was given a free sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	works well , smells nice
4	i think xen tan products are priced higher than i would pay , compared to their performance i did prefer this lotion to the deluxe weekly tanner , which came out a bit orange this gives a nice bronze tone with a pleasing fragrance it 's not the easiest to use , although purchasing the mitt helps i would n't recommend for first time self tanners or people who are just a little clumsy \( as i am \) , but if you 're to take the time and care , this will give a nice result it 's not the longest lasting color out there but those few days look good
5	i'm not normally a person that uses nail polish very often this take a nail polish appealed to me for the simple pale pink color and that 30 more oxygen gets to your nails julep is a quality brand for polish and makeup recommended
5	love this shade it is the perfect matte lipstick in a pink nude shade for the office it reminds me of the pink shade from bobbi brown
4	this is a very nice bronzer for anyone who has a light complexion my skin tone is very pale in the winter and this bronzing powder works great to contour and add color to my face i really have been more and more interested in cream bronzers , but this is a nice powder option i find that cream bronzers look better on my skin as i have aged over the years powder bronzers look great on younger skin nice compact with mirror
5	does a very good job , especially when used in conjunction with proraso pre shave and after shave i use all four flavors green , white , blue , and red spice is the variety of life and i enjoy rotating through different products and experiencing what each has to offer buy proraso products with confidence
3	meh does n't last very long
5	great product , cleans well and smells great !
5	i purchased this a few weeks ago and wanted to wait and see what happens before reviewing initially i did n't see much of a difference , but after several uses the results are amazing the serum is very light and i have been following the instructions of putting it on my skin every other night i exfoliate my skin , use a toner and add the serum after when the serum has fully absorbed i add my regular moisturizer and leave it on overnight i 've already noticed that my acne discoloration is fading dramatically whatever new acne bumps , cuts or red spots i have on my face become much duller in color after a single use before using this product , my acne would take a week to fully go away but now they disappear entirely after a few days this in healing makes perfect sense , as vitamin c is important in cross collagen during its formation i 've noticed that my skin definitely has a glow that i used to only see in the summer time after spending several days at the beach i'm 25 , so i cannot comment on wrinkles as they are already very minimal i do have very sensitive skin in general and i have not had an increase in breakouts using this product , which was a very comment occurrence with other products overall , i fully recommend this product and i wish that more people knew about it yes , it is slightly more expensive than other vitamin c serums , but the concentration as well as the other ingredients make this worth it i decided to not go for the higher concentration serums \( 20 \) because i was worried about break outs due to the high amount of ascorbic acid i absolutely love it and look forward to trying other mario badescu products
5	authentic pink sugar light and pleasant fragrance ! i have used pink sugar for years many people catch a sniff and instantly say , i love that ! what are you wearing \? i am not big on perfume or fragrances , but this is one that i love ! the pink spray hair perfume is meant to just give your hair a quick spritz it does not change the look or texture of your hair in any way also , as a side note , i purchased my pink sugar from amazon com as a seller , not a third party seller i can assure you that my purchase from amazon is the real deal and the fragrance we all love ! i would love this in a body wash !
5	this is a cool and powerful gadget that does all the face scrubbing for you i 've been using it for a couple of days now and my skin is noticeably softer , and a lot smoother it started working on the blackheads but i ca n't say they are completely gone there is definitely a visible effect , and i think i will get some results applying a pore minimizing creme after just do n't expect to completely eliminate blackheads with this device alone the brush has 4 speeds and has for your face and body the speed for your cheeks for example is different from the one for your chin , and the brush tells you when you need to move from one are to the next the package includes a face cleanser and a body scrub but you can of course use your own cosmetics it takes forever to charge the brush the first time but then the battery lasts quite a while i just wish it came with a stand like the charging station for your phone instead it comes with a usb cable and a wall charger i still managed to balance the brush on the charger the charger also has a little magnet that attaches to the brush nice touch !
5	i received a sample of this product and the fragrance was so lovely , i ordered a bottle i am very pleased the fragrance is not overpowering and lasts for some time it has a floral scent , which is heavenly you cannot go wrong with this product
3	i love eyeshadow i love playing with different colors , with going 'natural' one day with the nude palettes out there , smokey another \( nude , grey or dark \) , or having fun with various colors pinks , blues , greens and purples there are so many amazing colors and brands out there and i love trying them all this japonesque pixelated color eye shadow palette is a bit of a mixed bag \( no pun intended \) first , the eye shadow is decent , but it 's rather powdery not creamy or a touch of gel to it like some other palettes i have that are around this price point but maybe a little more you will need a primer of some sort , either for eye shadow or to set your make up to keep this from going all over the place , and a decent brush to apply it as with other japonesque eye shadow , yes , it 's buildable use a little and you get a light color and add more for intensity that or use some water \( especially with the black \) to really make it pop or for a liner effect what prevents this from being a four or five star review \? the colors you have four matte , more of a nude palette and then six of a shimmery , opal style palette the problem i have with this is that several of the colors are very similar the two highlights on the nude side are almost the same , one is just a little lighter you do n't have much to work with other than the two highlighter shades and the brown in fact , unless you want to go really dark with the black for a smokey look or as a liner on the shimmer pixelated side , you have two very identical purples , one again is a touch more than the other , cooler shade , and two greys , one more taupe than the other for ten colors , they could have put something a little different in here to punch up the variety , such as a pink , a true gold and so forth to make this more versatile for the money and if you 're going to take it on the go also , since the shadow is so powdery , one of the shadows is already \( the matte brown \) it arrived chipped this makes me concerned about using this as a shadow set , and one of the best things about a palette is being able to pack them and take them with me when i travel or need to put on make up somewhere else so , while i like japonesque make up and find them as a nice mid range option , i think you could buy a better eye shadow palette by finding other brands on sale \( urban decay , tarte , kat von d , etc \) that will offer you more of a color range unless you really like these particular colors and a more powdery style of eye shadow
1	really the design looks like it could be high end , and fitting of the high price tag unfortunately , that is not the case the clippers have rough , sharp edges that make this uncomfortable to hold and to handle the clipper itself is not very strong , so it 's not effective on thick nails at the very least , you 'd think they would have made a nice case that it would fit in but it 's really just a rough leather sleeve the clippers are hard to put in the case and it 's really not a good fit at all to add to injury , these clippers are made in china i'm sure i could do better with most drugstore clippers
5	i just love this color \)
5	bought this just for the halloween season and it did n't disappoint !
5	my wife loves this perfume she was worried when she saw sandalwood in the ingredient list , thinking it would be a heavy scent it is far from that it goes on with a sweet and salty smell on drydown it turns into a lovely floral smell it opens into a fruit , light , and transparent scents she said it is one of her favorite summer scents now her usual perfume is very irresistible and issey pure for of reference the bottle is very classy looking as well
3	i love lip color and was very excited to try this the color \( petal \) was a deep pink y rose color it looked like it would be complementary to all skin tones pros color is very nice it is compact there is no taste as a cheek color , it was pretty and stayed on me despite the hot sun melting the rest of my make up away cons dried my lips out within the hour of the application no application tool if you do n't have sensitive skin lips , try this because it chapped my lips so quickly , i ca n't recommend this for everyone
5	it was bigger than i wanted but still works wonderfully for other hair styles
5	the lime scent of lacoste live stick is absolutely heavenly lists guaiac wood , green leaves , aquatic notes and dark licorice as other ingredients in this very fresh scent my husband likes wearing it as much as i enjoy smelling it on him the stick has a nice , wide head and is easy to put on it does its job like a boss it 's the deodorant i 've ever seen , but if the lacoste scent is what you love , check it out if you 're not that picky , you can surely find a far less expensive deodorant with a pleasant lime scent this luxurious stick is perfect if you want to impress guys at the gym , or as a stocking stuffer for a special guy
3	i loved the way that this looked in the bottle but once i placed it on my nail i hated it , it made me look like i had barney hands i may look a little better on fairer skinned people though
5	excellent
5	all hail the queen was my first bottle of polish by butter london tired of thin polishes from essie and not really excited by opi at the moment , i finally decided to give this brand a try i 've purchased a bottle of chanel polish before , but 15 for nail color still seems steep to me i picked this color because it seemed safe lol and i just wanted to try the product line i really do like the color having brown skin it 's not exactly nude but a nice neutral color with a hint of sparkle to break up the the application reminded me a lot of the chanel bottle i have not just the removable top cover , but the fact that it brushes on neatly you wo n't end up with too much on the brush , minimizing clean up and product waste the color itself is nice and with a top coat it reminds me a little of those old sally hansen polishes , minus the color change effect i do like the texture of the polish and it 's wearable with or without a topcoat this color can also be worn well at one or two coats the drying time was fast , but i ca n't speak too much for the longevity yet i see complaints about chipping polish , which may be solved by making sure your nails are smooth , well buffed and totally clean of all oils after a day of wear , shampooing my hair etc my polish was still intact , at least \( i used out the door topcoat \) i'm not saying i'm a butter london fan just yet lol , but i did like this polish enough to order a second color when i saw my polish outdoors the next day , i ordered 3 more bottles of butter london polish from amazon lol while i'm sure other companies out there make a color comparable to this one , i'm happy i finally gave this brand a try
4	my teen with acne has been using bioderma sebium cleanser for a couple weeks i also tried it on my own sensitive , dry skin to see if its irritating and how it feels this is a foaming cleanser with a pleasant scent , but would be healthier without fragrance neither of us find this cleanser irritating to our skin this cleanser is too drying for my skin , but its not meant for my dry skin type its good for my teens skin and leaves his skin feeling clean , refreshed and not too dry or too oily his acne and overall complexion happen to look calm and nice lately while i cant say its due to this cleanser , it certainly has n't caused any irritation or breakouts i do n't like that this bioderma sebium cleanser has sodium laurel sulfate \( sls \) as it strips the skins protective barrier and over time will cause increased oil production to compensate it also has fragrance and other chemicals this cleanser does seem to be working well for my teen right now , but i do n't know the long run effects and think its best to switch off with a cleanser without sls overall , its a pleasing cleanser for my teens skin type and is a generously sized bottle of cleanser , but im only rating it 3 5 stars due to fragrance and sls
3	my dermatologist sells this brand so i 've tried several sunscreens from them i like this one a lot ! it 's hard to find a non greasy spf for face , let alone one that advertises as a mattifying product ! i'm sold on it clear , non reflective , non greasy so my makeup looks good ! ! it even takes powder foundation well i will buy more ! update after a week my skin is raw , itchy , red , and inflamed something in this is causing irritation which is pretty common for me with sunscreen usually i ca n't wear chemical sunscreens without a problem and i 'd thought this one would be ok because the brand is pretty good for me not this time
5	i like the baxter of herbal mint toner for men the solution is a great astringent toner that contains no drying alcohol , so it 's great for dry or sensitive skin , and it works well with combination and oily skin types , too it has a refreshing minty eucalyptus sea breeze like scent and it feels great going on my skin because it does n't contain alcohol you do n't get that extreme tingle sting like most other toners , but it still feels refreshing i highly recommend the toner and although it costs more than a drugstore brand , you only need to use a little of it another plus is that it 's formulated for men 's skin , which is supposed to be thicker and oilier than women 's skin , so the products work better than just the store bought type
5	thank you so much
3	pretty much for the teenagers who want wicked sparkle eyes or to reflect traffic lights into the night so they do n't get hit wow might be able to use it up for halloween
5	i am completely in love with this product \( and too many other mustela products to count since receiving them via amazon vine \) the mustela nourishing cleansing body gel with cold cream for dry skin smells amazing others might find the fragrance too strong but i liked that it lasted a long time and even overpowered the milk smell my happy little develops by the end of the day ! most importantly , it did n't irritate my baby 's skin in anyway with johnson johnson products , i found that they worsened out my baby 's cradle cap after only one wash but this mustela body gel did not irritate her skin , left baby 's hair stayed soft and her hair even separated from the cradle cap on her scalp a little other products have left baby 's curls stiff and spiky but the mustela left them soft and natural ! baby 's skin does feel a little softer than usual my only complaint is that there is n't a high amount lather when used with a rag but i did feel that the rag stayed soapy for a long time before i had to reapply i guess i'm used to baby products that lather a lot i also feel better knowing this product is paraben free ! it came with an attractive disposable lock in place on the spout which i thought was a nice touch because it made me feel like the product was protected during shipping the body gel itself does n't really have a gel consistency it 's more like hand soap and it 's similarly pearlescent also , the bottle contains a decent amount of product so i do n't feel like i will finish the bottle right away after a few uses if you can stand the smell , i highly recommend this and i am very impressed with the quality
5	if you like sandalwood and woodsy scents , this is your fragrance it is my all time favorite worth its price
5	nice feminine color with the wear you expect from cnd
5	this is the best exfoliater i have ever tried use it twice a week
5	pretty classy nuetral looks good on my light olive skin tone im in healthcare and this looks clean and professional essie always pleases !
4	i love the scent ! i am not quite sure what to make of it , because it does n't smell exactly like eucalyptus , although i do get a hint of that , as well the ingredients mention an added fragrance , so perhaps it 's a blend it 's invigorating , but relaxing at the same if that makes any sense it definitely reminds me of my last visit at the spa after leaving , i felt relaxed , but at the same time refreshed and ready to get on with my day that 's exactly how this cream makes me feel after using it it also has a thick texture that provides enough moisture , but at the same time it absorbs really well , so it does n't leave my skin all greasy or tacky i use this as an all over body lotion , with the exception of my face i'm happy with the larger sized jar , which really lasts this definitely offers me a quick and easy aromatherapy spa session right at home !
5	as promised and great transaction
2	i do n't like it i do n't understand why so many ladies love it , which i am not one of them it does not feel good on my lips , feeling like a wax to me
3	this one stings and makes me a little red the mineral one is amazing also i try to avoid chemical sunscreens in general
5	this shampoo is so hydrating , you may not feel the need for conditioner after using it my hair tends to be on the dry side and i 've found this shampoo really helps my hair is soft and smooth using this product
5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
4	i did not get a chance to buy it but if they have will buy it
5	this stayed on for two weeks without chipping in order to get the same results you need to use the cnd topcoat after polishing your nails ! you wo n't be disappointed
4	20 year consumer of pevonia did not observe much benefit from this specific product
5	i generally use an anti perspirant with no scent i 've found gel types can cause some itch and rash this deodorant , while not an anti perspirant , has a nice fragrance , and dries completely , leaving no stickiness or rash i really like it , and my spouse i can smell the vanilla , spice and citrus in this deodorant there are other subtle fragrances , but the effect is a masculine scent that lasts a few hours , and not all day it 's fall , and the cooler weather is probably an easy test for the effectiveness of deodorants still , a few swipes of this stick seems to last all day \( and night \) nice stuff , and it 's made in , so it must be good \) update 7 6 16 i use this deodorant every day it goes on easy and i like the fragrance which gradually fades wife likes it too no staining on my shirts and it does prevent odor through a day of workouts and warm weather
5	husband i both use this product
5	i had to regrow my beard in preparation for this conditioner i usually only keep mine during the winter , but this was a good opportunity to try growing a tamer version in the summer i have many other proraso products and they 're all very excellent i expected to feel the same with this , and i was so my beard grew only about a little over an inch by the time i started using this usually my beard grows thick and curly in the summer , and this time it was thick and with a little curl forming at the ends i applied this as directed and was rushed by the pleasant smell i usually let it sit for an hour before the results fully kick in , and do they ever even at the less than inch beard i have i can tell that my hairs are far softer and less to the touch i can finally rub my beard against my wife 's face when going in for a without being told it 's scratchy i might even let my beard continue to grow despite the chicago summer weather
5	i absolutely love this lipstick lipgloss ! it 's strange it looks very , very light in color and goes on very smooth once it is on it becomes a pink color that looks very natural it 's amazing ! definitely fully recommend it
3	this cream blush is nothing to brag about but i am using it has to be applied often more as it melts into the skin quickly it is not drying , but maybe a little too creamy not awful , but not great
4	it feels a little heavy and clunky but aside of that it works really good it heats up quickly and has a temperature control which is really nice to have my hair is a little thick so i need to use it on a high heat , whereas my daughter has thinner hair and uses it on a medium heat i thought it might work to help dry my wet hair but it really did n't works great on dry hair , though this is a nice alternative to a typical hair straightener
4	this is cnd 's new product , one week duration nice not worrying about if nails or dry or not and chipping polish
2	well it feels nice \) but i have very sensitive skin and it made me break out right away first night i wish i could use it smells great , feels great but pimples \)
5	japonesque has the most beautiful cases for their makeup the eyeshadow i received in shade 03 , is a very light shimmering gold color i try a lot of beauty products and find that this brand is high quality this particular shade though is too light for me and i prefer more of a matte look recommended brand
4	good evening moisterizer
5	love it , no more words needed
3	was drying not moist as expected
5	after using this , my face felt really smooth and my pores did look smaller and smoother this really is less messy than a regular mud mask i just put my hair back and peeled the backing off of the bottom part of the mask and pressed it on my face once it was stuck , i peeled off the front cover of the mask , so it would be able to dry and so that i could better smooth the mask onto my face then i did the same thing with the top part of the mask the directions say to let it dry for about 10 minutes , and i assume the longer it dries the better the results would be i waited a bit over 10 minutes it was dry in some spots , but not in the places where the mask a bit and the mud was thicker still , i was impatient and peeled it off it is easy to peel off if you pull up a corner and get it started after which , i rinsed my face it really was easy and way less mess than a regular mud mask the results were pretty good too
4	i like this eye treatment it 's not greasy and does n't sting your eyes it feels like i'm treating the skin around my eyes well i try to remember to put it on my eye lids and under the eye every night it keeps my skin from looking older i think so far so good will report back after i 've used it several months
2	where else can you get a washcloth that will leave fuzz all over your face \? nope do not get this you would do better with plain cotton cloths you can buy on here in a 10 pack that are much cheaper and way more effective i hate this thing the size is awkward , it does n't get off mascara \( of any type \) or eyeliner , and despite washing it per the instructions , it me all over my face blech save money , honey
5	mom likes it
5	i have been using this product for over a year now , and i recommend it to anyone that has thin hair on the top of the head the color blends in well with my own haircolor , and it adds body and texture to my own thin strands i do try and add a side part using a thin comb or pick in order for a more natural look , otherwise it can sometimes look like a wig without a natural hairpart i am a young woman , and without this product i would go back to feeling very self conscience and uncomfortable in public note would probably not work as well on bald heads or severe hair loss
5	great as usual !
5	saw this color featured in several magazines , and was happy to see it available here the color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors stunning with grays , jewel tones , and a real pop with black i like essie because it stays on nicely without chipping essie always has the perfect updated colors this color will look great with whatever you wear this winter \( the lace is on \) also bought another 2013 color , vested interest this is a lovely matte color , a greenish gray , that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors love the slightly edgy vibe , but super wearable , and looks fabulous on short nails
4	this paste smells a lot like sweet pipe tobacco so it 's on the manly side it holds a woman 's short hair in place too but you will smell the tobacco scent everywhere you go i just got my hair cut nice and short and since is at work right now i thought i 'd give it a try it definitely will hold your hair in place with a minimal amount , but i sure can smell it i like the scent of pipe tobacco but after a while i may have to wash it out tried out the 18 21 pomade yesterday and it smells a lot like this paste so , either one will hold your hair pretty much all day but the scents are rather strong
5	good product !
5	excellent blowdryer very quiet and powerful but it is a bit heavy as others said in their reviews does n't bother me , it takes so much less time to dry my hair that it is worth the extra weight
5	i have really sensitive skin and can say for certain that this helps me remove make up and other grime off of my face without any irritation or breakouts or redness of any kind i'm really happy with this product
5	years ago i tried a dermablend concealer , but it was thick and cakey i did n't like it well , they have improved this product 100 and i just love it ! the color runs just a bit darker than expected , so i recommend purchasing a shade lighter than you usually might buy \( i have an extremely fair complexion , so i do n't know about the darker colors \) the wand applicator carries just enough product to dot along areas you wish to conceal after dotting , you tap the product in with your finger or a sponge the coverage is very good and the product does n't settle into fine lines , which i love ! after applying the concealer , just apply the rest of your makeup as usual , and it looks very natural good stuff ! five stars
5	it is useful as it described
5	love it , fast ship trust which is very great business relationship with customers buyers need to trust them and buy it because i have great positive feel with them
3	i got this for the wife and since i'm to most makeup , i had to rely on her judgement after 3 weeks , i did n't notice anything about her skin but she said it made it look better although i could n't see anything so i tried it myself for a week and did n't notice anything either a drop or two on the face did n't seem to make me look or feel any different a lot of the reviews had mentioned the odor i did n't detect much of an odor nor did the wife there 's a bit of one but it dissipates rather quickly there 's no lingering feel to the fingers when i applied it , so that 's an added benefit then there 's the price at nearly 100 certainly i wo n't you if you spend the money on this , but i ca n't see spending the money on something that does n't seem to improve the skin the wife 's response at finding out the price , other than shock , was to say that her normal moisturizers do the same at a lot less cost i do n't see our household ordering another one of these but ultimately if you like it and it makes you feel good , then i'm happy for you but for us it was average at best
3	as others have noted , this product does not come with instructions \( or warnings ! \) and you may find yourself twisting , twisting , twisting and what 's with this product , already \? until , when you least expect it , a whole lot of product comes out the first time you use very wasteful and easily avoided with some instructions other products that twist in this manner to release product that i 've used never let loose with so much product the first time the medium color worked well for my skin tone and would probably be the better choice over light , unless you have very light skin i found the liquid to be a bit heavy in texture and weight and you have to really use a lot less than may come out if you want to ensure that it 's easily blended and not looking like you 've applied a different color under your eye it concealed well , but , alas , as others have noted , seemed to highlight whatever wrinkles one has rather than concealing them at this price , it 's a very expensive product to cover blemishes , etc depending on your skin type and condition , you could find a product that worked as well for about a third of this price and was less heavy and wrinkle highlighting also , given how much comes out and how it seems as if you ca n't really control the amount that comes out \( regardless of number of twists and again , what does the company suggest \? even cheap products come with basic instructions \) and this could lead to a lot of waste if you use daily not a bad product , but for me , not worth the price for what it delivers \( fyi i do own a couple of pricey makeup products that i 've acquired over the years however , they work really well for their advertised features and are cost effective given how long they last and perform so do n't think i'm biased against a product just based on price i 've got an eye primer and a skin primer that both cost 30 when not on sale , but i love them \)
5	necessary for anyone with acne skin !
5	identical to the diffuser version , but much stronger one spritz immediately scents the room ! love this warm vanilla scent for every room in the house !
4	i like this self tanner product a lot because the ingredients are a lot better than other commercial tanners it has a very nice , mild smell that does n't linger while it does foam up using the pump , i would n't really describe it as a mousse i did n't have a tanning mitt to use so i just use my hands it went on well and dried fast as promised it does tend to build up around areas they recommend you avoid such as the knees of course overall , i really recommend it i'm happy with the color and coverage \( i have an olive or yellow undertone \) the color faded evenly over 5 6 days and there 's plenty left for more use
5	wife says really good product smooth in application and stays for about 3 4 hours i use it mainly for contouring and hiding spots on the face i do apply it in layers the very first time ensuring that the skin absorbs enough of it i do not have sensitive skin but products that are low quality tend to break out my skin it 's not the case with the dermablend foundation i apply it with a makeup buff , set it with dermablend face powder and spray face mist , which helps it set on my skin beautifully
5	just the color i wanted
4	fan shaped brush worked great quite big to store , but bristles are soft , and works exactly as promised
5	seriously a beautiful color ! a must have for polish lovers , and especially nude polish lovers !
5	jack black double shampoo plus conditioner i love this shampoo conditioner , as it feels as though it really made my hair clean , and it was easy to comb after i finished washing i also loved the smell it is sort of hard to explain , but it kind of reminded me of an old timey smell but the smell is not strong just enough to sort of remind me of that wonderful old timey smell i love old timey smells \( even though this is not that strong of a smell , just enough to know it 's there \) that 's one reason why i love going inside one of our natural stores it has the smells and the feelings of old timey because of the smell , the wonderful cleansing , and the manageability , i highly recommend this shampoo conditioner
1	i am a cosmetic and bath junkie , but also care about what ingredients are in my products i was concerned that petrolatum is the 2nd ingredient listed i googled petrolatum and what i read , confirmed my fears i just wish they 'd not use petrolatum as the 2nd ingredient after sugar \(
5	i love love love this color no matter what season , it always looks great and i get compliments on it
5	i'm a big fan of tizo sunscreens i have a severe sensitivity to the sun and the chemical sunscreens wo n't do it for me i need zinc the have all worked very well for me i particularly rely on this tinted one for my face note that the tint is n't nearly dense enough to serve as some kind of foundation makeup that 's not its purpose i think the tint is just to avoid that white undertone you sometimes get with zinc sunscreens , and this very well at avoiding that i put it on first and then go ahead and put whatever makeup or coverup i'm using right over it works great i have n't broken out or burned yet !
5	love this color !
5	like it
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	perfect for fall winter !
5	i prefer this dry shampoo over the oscar blandi spray the dry shampoo it can be placed precisely where needed , and with practice does n't leave any tell tale residue in the hair nobody seems to carry the 2 5 oz version anymore , so i 'll have to make do with the 1 oz size and purchase it more frequently until it 's no longer available in fact , i just purchased 3
5	i 've been using this for six months now , and wanted to wait that long to write a review to make sure that this works i originally splurged \( thanks to a great coupon on sephora \) on the regular sized device , along with the ele eye and lip enhancer and the laser , but only used them twice before returning the set and getting the nuface mini from amazon while i saw results when i used the regular nuface after each session , i decided to exchange it for the mini since i quickly realized that the mini would allow me to do almost everything that i had been hoping that the ele attachment would enable me to do as a bit of background , i'm a few months shy of 45 , and , while i think my skin looks decent overall because i 've been using retin a for about fifteen years , i do have some to my face and my feet have been getting more pronounced i do n't have any desire to get injections , so this seemed like a good alternative , and it has been so far while it has n't done any miracles on my face , my feet do seem improved , and my skin looks tighter it has n't made much of a difference in my folds , and i really had been hoping it would when i used it the first time , the ele left a huge indentation along my left hand smile line that took 48 hours \( ! ! ! \) to fully go away i was following along with the video when this happened , and have to say that it really me out even my husband noticed and asked me what was going on when i contacted the company , they said that they could n't really advise me what to do , but , as i said , it did go away after that , i decided to return the large nuface since using the ele attachment again made me nervous , and that 's when i bought this mini the way that this works is that you use it in sweeping motions and in certain held positions until it beeps at you after five seconds in the places where you sweep , you pass it over three areas , three times each , in a certain pattern because this was such a large expense for me , i read a ton of reviews on various websites before buying the regular nuface and then the mini , and here are some things to know before you buy realize that this does take a time commitment when you first get it , you 're supposed to use it six days a week for the first two months , and after that you can cut back to a few times a week you only need to use it five minutes a day , but you can add on a few extra holds in other areas of your face , which is what i have been doing since i got it back in november even doing that , a treatment session takes about fifteen minutes , which is much better for lazy me than the twenty to thirty minutes that using the two other attachments \( the ele and laser \) would take i know that im lazy about the extra commitment that using the ele and laser attachments would require , so , for me , the mini seemed like a better option i definitely taste a metallic taste after using this along my jawline and near my mouth it goes away after about an hour , but is still a bit unsettling at first other reviewers are correct that the gel that this comes with is pretty awful it dries right away , and if its not wet , youll have to keep applying it or you will feel a sting i ended up buying some aloe vera gel , but it did n't work that well and i had red marks on my face i decided to get some gel \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href spectra 360 gel parker laboratories 8 5 oz tube pack of 2 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 spectra 360 gel parker laboratories 8 5 oz tube \( pack of 2 \) a \) , and it works perfectly speaking of the sting , if you do notice this , use more gel and those stings will go away i also had some red streaks the first time i used this since i hadnt realized that i needed to re apply the gel since it dried up really quickly on my first pass of the device when you get the device , the instruction manual will include a link to a nuface site with some videos on how to use this device properly i followed along a few times , then i placed the printed out instructions in a sheet protector so i could keep it on hand for reference and not be worried about water dripping on it \( a lesson learned the hard way \) the company also has a free you can to your that will walk you through using it and also give you im on the smaller side with a long , narrow face , so the regular balls felt almost too large to get in smaller places like under my eyebrows and above my lips the mini glides along my face and is easier to use for me i had really wanted the light attachment , but it sends out constant pulses of light , and that made it a challenge for me to use since it hurt my eyes while using it i know you can wear goggles while using that attachment to avoid the annoyance , but the flashing light around my eyes would still be present when using it on those areas expect for your face to hurt a bit after you first start using this i have n't experienced any bruising , but the soreness i felt in my face is similar to that i feel after lifting , when the muscle feels that feeling lasted about two months , but i now no longer notice it overall , i'm pleased with this little device if you get into a regular habit of using it , it makes a difference , and it 's a nice way to make your skin look more refreshed and toned
4	i like this cream it has a bit of a stronger scent then the body lotion but it 's very pleasant it has good ingredients as well including shea butter , coconut oil , cocoa butter and olive oil all are good and rich ingredients for your skin what i do n't love is the price it seems pretty high i do like the cream it 's very hydrating and feels great on my aging skin recommended
5	i usually do not buy makeup by the higher of makeup manufacturers lancome , clinique , etc i use mostly maybelline or cover girl because they seem to work well and are so much less expensive i received this foundation which is pricier by a company i had never heard of japonesque i can see why it costs a little more i barely had to use any and it completely the need for a primary cover up stick and i had a luminous and flawless face i have a sun spot and acne scarring so for this product to be able to do that is pretty amazing i am actually very pleased with it and you get a bigger bottle than you do normally i am considering using this permanently because it just went on so easily and now without having to by a separate concealer it may be worth the price
5	the numerous pictures provided on the product page along with the ones others have posted provide an accurate run down of the contents of this sample box so i had a general idea what to expect and was not disappointed the main differences from what is presented are things like the flavor of the toothpaste sample and nail polish color , etc these are samples that are sometimes offered or available in high end department stores but instead of making multiple trips to the brick and mortar locations , all are here and the cost of the box is with a credit to be used on the purchase of selected items within this product class the julep nail polish color varies i received a gorgeous shade of blue \( it girl \) which is one i would have selected for purchase i have a couple of bottles of their polish and this is a full size container , not a sample , and it costs approximately 2 3 the price of the entire sample box alone , and that is over and above the credit toward a future purchase within the selected group so , for me this sample box idea is a win because even with items that may not initially be of interest , i rarely refuse a free sample since in the past i have discovered helpful items i did not know about and even switched brands after trying something new and , i can check for skin sensitivities with a sample before purchase so that the box is not customized is not a primary concern specific contents within the 20 samples i received include two mens cologne and a shaving cream sample but otherwise the contents are either generic , like the toothpaste , or are products marketed to women i received three cologne samples i was curious about , one which i liked enough that i plan to buy more the ahava product i received was a 1 3 ounce tube of their hand cream , something i wanted to try and was impressed overall very pleased
5	dj play that song is a vibrant purple magenta hue it goes on fantastically is as bright as the bottle there is more pink in the polish than i thought from viewing online , but i love the shade
5	i use this every day , but i also shower at night and no poo my baby fine hair every few days if you do not , then the fibers might get on your pillowcase with a new bottle , i peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker , then tape off 1 2 of the opening with blue painter 's tape otherwise too much will come out too fast you do not actually shake this on to your hair , but instead into your part lines part your hair , hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so , and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there you may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue if you have a lot of fibers on your forehead , you are tapping too much and too hard or you did n't seal off 50 of the shaker with painter 's tape it does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller , just a tap tap tap and them move on to the next area this would not work well for extensive baldness \( nothing does ! \) , but works well for the dreaded wide part problem dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light skinned person , as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair they have a really small travel size that i carry in my handbag , so you can try it without spending much you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one ! one suggestion for toppik company is to make the darn container transparent it is completely opaque , so there is no way to know when you are running out , except to shake it in the sink dumb , as people would order sooner , if they knew they were running low
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	pure hydrating water in a convenient spray helps calm cranky babies when you are outside and ca n't get indoors , or you are on an outside adventure most of the time it makes them laugh or at least distracted enough from their heat discomfort to allow the calming effects of the water spray to cool them for skin health , dermatologists recommend to hydrate the skin before your creams , etc , so that the rate is greater seems to work in that regard as well this is a clean , natural toner after cleansing and the minerals are good for the skin
2	first , amazon sent me the wrong size i ordered the 1 7 and received the 5 oz , 15ml version instead having used the small version , i ca n't tell if the larger one would provide better results over time the price of the 1 7 oz version , however , is very high and for that same price you could get a botox treatment , quite frankly it goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel nice and smooth , but i honestly ca n't say it shaved twenty years off my skin it feels very concentrated so you do n't need a lot , which is a relief given how pricey it is i think la mer has a better scent and makes my skin feel \( and look \) just as good , and looks like a bargain compared to this take away the price point , and it 's a decent but not extraordinary anti aging moisturizer

5	do n't leave home without it !
4	nice color , applied pretty evenly
5	this is a creamy , gradual self tanning lotion it softens and makes your skin look and feel moisturized , without feeling greasy i applied it over my tan and i thought my skin looked radiant and soft it does have a slight smell , but not anything like any other self tanner i 've used before i did have to allow for just a little more time , than with their mousse , but i just stood in front of my fan and that helped to dry it it contains over 6 ounces of product , so a little more product than what the mousse holds for the same price , and it moisturizers your skin here is what the manufacturer says a superbly hydrating lotion that applies clear for zero transfer onto clothing and then develops to a beautiful subtle glow that be with daily use formulated with aloe vera shea butter to soothe and moisturize
5	i love this rosewater and aloe facial spray i live in the high desert and my facial beauty regimen changes constantly even with a normal skin complexion my face feels fresh and clean during and after ever spritz and i love the light rose aroma this really helps keep my face balanced during the seasons
5	love how my feet feel after i put it on
5	i have been using the foaming cleanser from this line for a few years it was recommended by a cosmetic dermatologist this is a light cream that layers easily under makeup it is not greasy and it has no fragrance the chemistry behind the product is sound and it is a nice addition to my beauty routine it is recommended to apply this to face and neck to reduce the appearance of lines
5	this stuff is fabulous ! i started using it a few months ago and there will be no turning back love the product !
5	one of the best top coats out there ! dries fast and protects your manicure from chipping
4	smells amazing i think it works \? have n't really noticed , but i honestly just use it for the smell in my hair
4	i have very picky skin , pretty sensitive with adult onset acne typically i cannot tolerate benzoyl peroxide , but this is much more gentle than proactiv and kate , in my opinion i do not use this daily , but every other day , sometimes every third day and has done such wonders immediately my acne became less pronounced , the redness of my spots no longer looked as angry at this point i am considering this a must have and will update if anything changes !
5	very nice summer polish !
5	this is a top quality product it absorbs quickly , has excellent coverage , and does everything the product page description says it does when i'm using it , my skin looks clear and smooth , with an even color and a healthy luster there is a slight citrus scent to it , very mild , when i'm applying but it does not linger overall , a terrific product
4	i like the way this cream leaves my hands feeling soft and smooth it has a nice creamy texture that at first feels greasy but is quickly absorbed the only thing i do n't like is the strong floral scent when the lotion first leaves the tube however , it does fade after a few minutes and becomes tolerable
4	i'm really not sure if and how it 's different from my beloved out the door , topcoat , but surely it is i use this in with the cnd colors and sometimes get a week out of the polish
5	great for travel
5	great
4	i think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard i am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter , but going to give it a try i love the thickness of this foundation , it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles if you do n't like high coverage foundation , this is not for you if you need a highly pigmented , high coverage foundation , i recommend you try this one i am very happy with it , but i might need to try another shade i think this foundation might be enough to cover blemishes dark circles , and might not even need concealer i like eliminating steps in my make up routine
4	the best thing about this eye liner for me is that it lasts my other eye liner goes on more easily , thicker and more smoothly , but it does n't last as long i think it 's oilier or waxier which makes it go on very easily , but then come off easily this has a thinner line , but you can go over it again to make it appear thicker and darker it did n't irritate my eyes as some eyeliners do and it does n't collect in the corner of my eyes as other eyeliners do my only wish is that it sent on more smoothly , but then it might come off more easily so , that 's a trade off i have n't found an eyeliner which lasts as long as this one does , so if that 's what you 're looking for , this may be a 5 star product
5	wonderful quality and presentation the kit is quite pleasing , the cremes and lotions are wonderfully decadent and soothing i have no problem recommending this as a gift for a gentleman , young or old it was a joy to experience the art of shaving again i have become so to the quick and easy electric shave that i forgot how much more effective and satisfying a true shave actually is i did have a problem that is worth mentioning it turns out that i am allergic to badger hair who knew ! \? ! \? i developed allergies to cats and many years ago i have a more mild allergy to dogs even the hypoallergenic ones my advice is that you be cautious with the lovely badger hair brush if you have known allergies to other fur just a warning i certainly do n't blame the maker for my allergy to
5	very subtle , light scent seaberry does n't smell too much like berries , just lightly fruity i honestly do n't really smell it after my hair is dry , so it definitely does n't clash with perfume or any other scents the conditioning is a very good level for my very fine hair i have blonde hair , and anything too heavy also makes it seem dirty or appear to have buildup or oil faster that is n't a problem with this conditioner if my hair is especially or dry \( such as after swimming or a very windy day , i may mix it up and use a heavier conditioner \( like pantene smooth sleek \) , but the obliphica is awesome for everyday use it is very rich and thick as compared to other conditioners , it is definitely not watered down it is easy to spread just on the areas you want it , if you prefer to target your conditioner more towards the ends of your hair the bottle is compact , which actually makes it nice for carrying along on a trip or to the gym it also has a shorter , perfectly round , shape , which makes it not over and hit my foot \( a pet peeve ! \) the pump works very well , only problem is that it may take slightly longer if you use a lot of conditioner not because it clogs , just because it after a pump relatively slowly although , usually the ones that rise up quickly end up with large air pockets inside the bottle , so they 're not much faster in the long run overall , a very nice , rich feeling conditioner that makes my hair soft and well conditioned , but not weighed down not an overly fruity scent , but clean and light
5	this blower brush is fantastic especially for ladies with baby fine hair my me it gives it bounce and volume and shine it 's easy to use and you get very hair air which is something lacking in the other blower i had to return i recommend this product highly
4	i wanted a summer yellow , but one that was a bright as bicycle yellow this one fills the bill perfectly but , needed 3 or 4 coats the next time , i used white as my first coat and needed only two yellow coats
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	this is an interesting facial mask , different from any i 've used before it 's more of a gel that you use on your cleaned face after cleaning your face , apply a thin layer of vichy quenching mineral face mask , let it dry about 5 minutes , then wipe it away with a clean cloth or cotton pad after it dries , your skin might feel slightly tacky if that bothers you , then you 'll probably want to rinse the mask off however , leaving the mask on your face will provide about 24 hours of moisturization this gel mask provides vitamin b3 which helps soothe your skin vichy quenching mask leaves my skin feeling moisturized , but slightly sticky
5	so cute
5	so i bought something and got a free sample of this and i tried it out and it was amazing , since it 's a tinted moisturizer ! i just love it !
5	love it ! ! ! !
3	i really wanted to ignore the and love this but it 's so hard to get on that i never use it
5	still makes a great !
3	i 've been using this eye cream steadily for a few weeks and really like it for the most part it sinks in easily and is n't greasy , as promised it seems to brighten up the eye area and i look a little less tired the only thing i really do n't like is the fragrance while i do n't mind a little scent , this is overpoweringly strong and floral , i think lily of the valley while i like the smell of the actual flower , this was just too much to have on my face so while it seems beneficial as far as appearance , i would n't buy it again based on the fragrance
3	this is my first high quality shaving cream i 've been using goat 's milk shaving cream with a lather brush since it has very little ingredients in it when in a pinch i 'll use something cheap like barbasol , such as when i'm on a trip and just need a small can of something packaging i had to hunt for the english information as everything on this packaging is in french for the most part some instructions in four other languages once removing the metal tube from the box , there is one logo that tells you what it is and no instructions travel in usa speaking of trips when travelling in the usa this is too large \( exceeds the 3 4 oz size \) to take through security and may get checking out l'occitane store here on amazon , they do n't have a smaller size lather i did n't have any trouble lathering a dime sized amount in my palm or similar amount when using the lather brush the small amount lathered just fine and went on thick enough , though it required a little more massaging once on my face scent i'm use to sandlewood scent or something menthol with my cheap shaving cream options this scent i ca n't quite place , but it 's not unpleasant since i tend to finish off with a scented after shave any dislike for this scent will someone be rinsed off then masked with after shave shaving once i spent sufficient time lathering , i did n't get much of any shave burns it helped cut just fine and left my skin refreshed enough overall i'm a newbie when it comes to using different qualities of shaving products , so i admit i'm trying to judge this the best i can what will be the true test is if i get some highly rated shaving cream that cost about 50 of this one and see between the three price ranges \( goat 's milk , mid level and this one \) if i can really tell a difference i appreciate it 's concentrated , but time will tell how much i get out of the tube and if it 's cost effective for the experience i 'd get from shaving with it so far , it 's okay
4	good price for my favorite hair spray easy to comb out and holds well with some flexibility
4	v76 beard oil by vaughn is good oil it has a very light scent it is a spray on and that is why i rated it 4 instead of 5 stars it will drip very easily if you are not careful that being said it does condition skin and dry rough beard hair well it was used after a thorough beard wash , which makes your beard hold onto beard oil really well and soften it
4	this color took nearly three weeks to be delivered the color is hot orange and neon but it dries in matte finish not gloss i wish it was glossy because the matte finish always looks cheap it 's hard to find a neon nail polish that looks glossy and high def
5	i love this toner ! it is refreshing and makes my face feel soft and clean i use it with mb 's enzyme cleansing gel and have been using these products together for a couple of years now along with a couple of other changes to my skin care regimen , i have seen a huge improvement in break outs and cystic acne
3	i really noticed no difference after weeks of using this product i do n't really think it did anything for my skin it did n't cause any problems , or feel strange or anything , but it did n't do what it 's supposed to do i imagine results will vary from person to person , but it just was n't for me i would n't purchase it your results could be hit or miss
5	dave 's wife dave 's wife i had never bought pca on amazon before , so i was a little worried but the products was sealed and legitimate i 'll be buying again
4	the first thing to keep in mind before buying this is that an electric shaver can never be as close as a manual safety razor blade some come close but the shave will always be inferior to a real blade the real benefit of an electric razor is that it can be used practically anywhere and it does not require shaving cream or a great deal of care to prevent nicks or cuts if you are ok with this fact then the lumarx foil shaver is a decent choice it is very easy to use and comfortable the shave is close enough for general areas such as armpits but it wo n't wow you with skin that feels silky smooth most women will find this to be great for daily use but when you really need a close shave a manual is always the best choice positive points easy to charge on its included charging stand has a built in trimmer that is comfortable to use provides a fairly consistent shave that is reasonably close has a reasonable shave time of 30 minutes per charge has a nice carrying pouch and brush to help clean the razor negative points charge time is very long \( 20 hrs \) shaving foil works well in most areas but is a bit large for sensitive areas the instructions mention replacing the foil every 6 months which seems a little too frequent shaver must be dry before charging no display or indicator to let you know how much charge is left
5	my hair is naturally curly and fine , so no matter how hard i try , i ca n't get beach waves but ! oribe 's matte waves lotion does an amazing job of controlling my curls , which have a tendency to fly away in humidity , and it 's amazing for keeping braids smooth and in place it also holds very nicely when i take a braid out , leaving my hair with tight waves instead of my natural curls and on top of that , this product smells amazing it 's pricy , but i highly recommend it for keeping curly hair under control
5	fast service good product ! always love cnd nail shellac have been using it for a year now i am very satisfied
1	this arrived without any sort of seal , it was not even in any kind of box or protective wrapper , and the product is liquid
4	and does n't really deliver the foamy lather i was expecting and hoping for still , just a small amount of product cleans my face very well , leaving it smooth and soft i 'd still prefer more actual foam , but all things considered , this is a good cleanser
5	capital soleil , a new line of products from vichy , combines the attributes of a serious , broad spectrum sunscreen with that of advanced skin care these products are intended to be used year round \( not just at the beach \) and are appropriate for adults , and children over six months , with normal or sensitive skin this particular lotion goes on quickly and smoothly and dries without stickiness it provides excellent uva uvb protection while leaving the skin soft and moisturized i remember my parents drinking bottled vichy water , a highly bubbly water from the hot springs in vichy , france the minerals in the water were supposed to be good for the , especially after a heavy meal at the site of the hot springs in france were thermal spas where people would go for therapeutic treatments today , vichy laboratories uses the same naturally formed mineral waters in their line of skin care products the claim is that the waters contain 15 minerals and antioxidants that refresh and soothe skin , strengthening its natural defenses and increasing its ability to repair to me , the best part of this product is that you can wear sun screen without any of the telltale negative aspects strong coconut or other beach appropriate aroma , or shiny , sticky , heavy coated feel you apply this lotion , and you are the only one who knows it is a sunscreen
4	this seems like a great , refreshing toner it disperses nicely from the spray bottle and it feels good going on my skin a few spritzes go a long way it leaves my skin feeling soft and moist after application it has a rather unique fragrance , not unpleasant and not great neither fortunately for me , it does n't linger the toner is supposed to help refine and improve skin appearance due to aging however , the jury is still out i have n't seen any noticeable improvement yet at any rate , i 'll continue to use it since i like how refreshing it is other than the so so scent , it 's worth a try
2	very thin liquid and a lot of it comes out at once made my skin feel extremely dry and tight actually would hurt to smile because my skin was so dry i also use retin a and had read online that this cleanser would still be okay to use , but i found it extremely harsh for me also , it 's not really a gel it 's a very runny gel almost like a liquid a lot comes out at once and you actually need a lot for a lather i also bought lrp 's pigmentclar cleanser and you literally only need a quarter of a pea sized dollop in order to clean your entire face it 's amazing !
4	this review will be done from the perspective of a makeup artist i am going to explain how i find it is best to apply and use this foundation based upon the formula , and then how i think that this performs compared to other products that i have used over time what is this foundation like \? first of all , this is a very thick creme foundation this type of foundation is different in performance and application than lotion , powder , or mineral foundation more on that later the foundation comes in a clear jar with cap on it there is no scent , , and it is highly pigmented color \? i have compared this to a few colors i have access to at the moment and can tell you this color , medium beige chroma 2 1 2 is similar lightness to bare escentuals medium beige , but be is quite a bit yellower base lighter by two shades from mac nw25 studio tech formula which is similar to this it is the same tone range , however this color has a more pink base to it , but is not so pink that it looks strange like some foundations this is more suitable for cooler complexions , but not limited to how to apply first of all , make sure that your face is moisturized after cleaning it good moisturizing is key you can use a primer , if you like i happen to really like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href face glow primer hydrating 1 01 oz 30 ml dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \?

ie utf8 swanson hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz \( 29 6 ml \) serum a nbsp for more oily or normal and younger skin the way to apply this foundation is to take the jar , open it up and get yourself a beauty blender i prefer to stay with the name brand as i have tried many and still go back to the beauty blender for the best performance wet and squeeze out the beauty blender , so it is damp then dab the beauty blender into the dermablend and just get a small amount on the surface so that it looks like there is not much at all on there choose a quarter of your face area and begin to bounce the sponge all around that area it will look like you are not doing much of anything trust me , you are for under the eyes , take the tip of the beauty blender and from side to side , bounce the foundation from inner to outer corner of the eye again , it wo n't look like you are doing much at first keep going you wo n't have to get the surface of the sponge loaded more than four or five times in most cases you keep bouncing around and around the skin and suddenly you will see that the skin is covered , but still looks like skin that is what you are going for any other application method does not do this foundation justice and will not be as realistic flattering looking comments although i am not as fond of this as i am nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href graftobian hd creme foundation super palette neutral dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 graftobian hd creme foundation super palette neutral a , which is also available in individual colors , this is as close to it as i have come so far my problem with the dermablend is this it has sunscreen in it many times when wearing this level of foundation , there is a special occasion involved that usually means photos will be taken sunscreen makes for some pretty weird effects on film it will look white , or off color in certain light as well you can use this at home and think it looks perfect , but in some light it can look really off if this did not have sunscreen in it , i would like it better however , if you really love sunscreen and do n't plan to have photos taken in this foundation or do n't care if it looks off in photos or on video , then this is a nice foundation wear is pretty much all day , even in humid weather , although it does come off it there is a lot of sweating involved and might need to be reapplied in certain situations setting with powder helps a little bit but in really hot sweaty weather , that might not help the bottom line if applied as outlined in this review , this is an excellently performing foundation although the color turned out to be lighter than i expected , if applied as i outlined , it will blend well with skin that is not an exact match sunscreen in this will alter photos or look off in certain light , but if that does not bother you , then it still is a good choice great coverage and generally speaking excellent durability \( except extreme humidity and heat \) this foundation could be an excellent choice for more natural looking coverage that does not crease excessively or crack off if applied any other way , results will be different rating four stars because this has sunscreen in it i prefer to have no sunscreen in foundation if someone wants to have sunscreen , i prefer to add it separately if it did not have sunscreen , i would like it a bit better
5	absolutely a beautiful color you wo n't regret your purchase i was very pleased with how prompt the seller was in getting the merchandise out and it was as described
5	i am a woman and chose this for myself since i cannot resist a lip balm i liked it right away for the non waxy feel and the great lime scent since this is a product designed for men i asked my husband to try it i was n't sure how this would go over since he is strictly a haircut and bar soap kind of guy he tried it and loved it he of this tube so i was forced to buy my own he loved the feel , the scent and the moisturizing quality he also commented that it did n't feel greasy the slight sheen did n't bother him at all i am very prone to lip rash for products and am delighted with how well i tolerate this balm we love it and recommend it
4	i have been using a competitors bb cream , and i have liked the results these foundation creams seem to lie on top of the skin , masking wrinkles ordinary foundations seem to accentuate the wrinkles by sinking into them this particular bb cream has a higher spf , 25 that is good , because the suns rays can to wrinkle formation the only problem is that this foundation must be kept away from the eyes , because it does irritate eyes and burn this creates a problem for women like me , who apply foundation to the eyelids and under eye area , in order to create a more uniform canvas with which to work this cream does seem to nourish the skin , making it softer it blends easily , providing a light , glowing , healthy coverage it seems to last much of the day , and it is comfortable to wear and non drying
4	is larger than you think ! make sure you do n't just want a 1 5 inch iron before you order this it is lovely , works very well , and can be used to wave or straighten it is especially useful for my layers the thing is so big , though , that it is difficult to avoid it in the bathroom i 've already burned myself twice be careful ! !
5	great spring color
4	mineral water that you spray on your face \? ha i remember when this kind of thing became popular 20 years ago , the spa treatment i guess it stuck around and now its my turn to try it ! first it smells a bit earthy cannot explain how it smells at all , its not unpleasant ! second , its truly refreshing , wakes you up , leaves you feeling and perky i cannot use this all the time , because i wear make up that will bleed , but this is good for those times you cannot put on makeup and need a boost
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great gray if that 's what you are looking for more gray than silver but still cute
5	this is a standard that i will always have in my collection it 's trendy because it is darker but very professional in the office
4	i just bought this color and tried infinite shine for the first time i am blown away ! i had to come and leave a review pros it 's a thick polish that is very easy to manipulate it 's incredibly shiny i have been doing my own gel nails at home with a gel light for years and this polish looks the exact same as when i do my nails in gel it dries fast i painted my nails with the 3 steps and 30 min later it 's totally dry i also love the color it looks a lot like you dont know cons none yet ! i will check back in to see if it truly lasts the 7 10 days as advertised update 11 1 15 sadly , the product does not last that long i 've tried two separate colors and it only lasts about 3 days before it starts to chip definitely better than a regular top coat , not nearly as good as my gel nails at home
5	great product to use for circles under eyes or just to brighten areas blends easily and stays put , all while looking completely natural
5	i cannot stand filing out these and comments , but , i do love this product , both as a moisturizer and as a conductor for the nuface device i am starting to see some muscle memory in and firmness in the face hopefully this review will suffice and i will not have to respond to after every purchase i will this product again
5	verdict \? this product is great i was skeptical of this blush at first , thinking cream to powder meant it would go on like either foundation from a compact or lipstick , and then have to be rubbed in hard to distribute i was so wrong it goes on silky silky soft and subtle \( seriously i tried it on my lips and it was far more silky than any lipstick i 've ever tried , though it then settled to a gentle powder \) and when it said to apply over blush for a more dramatic look , i had images of 1980s blush streaks , but nothing could be further from the truth it goes on super super subtle and soft yes , you can push hard to get it a bit darker , but you 'd really have to work at it by default it goes on as gently as a typical powder blush and the color \( candid \) is a subtle subtle pinkish , so it will probably work with most skin tones as it 's too gentle to clash p and easy to distribute \( with just a fingertip \) for a moment or two after applying i tried it on my lips and it made almost no difference took a tiny bit of the color out of them , but was hardly noticeable it was super subtle on my eyelids as well i 'll probably just use it as blush i was a bit surprised at the shape of the container i think i must have been expecting something shaped like lipstick , because this was really short at just 2 \( lipstick is usually 3 4 \) , and wide \( 1 diameter whereas lipstick is normally 1 2 3 4 wide \) but that actually worked better for broad smooth application vs narrow streaks , so it makes sense note the jane iredale site has more pictures and details about colors if that would be helpful for you
4	i do like this creme rinse probably not enough to spend the reordering though
2	it seems i'm on a constant search for a quality under eye concealer i have very fair skin and constant dark circles i 've tried expensive products \( like smashbox \) and 10 and under drug store products \( cover girl , maybelline , etc \) i 'd say this product is comparable in quality to a drug store product with the price of an expensive brand the product does go on very smoothly , and i think it will last a long time a little bit goes a long way but as far as coverage goes , it does n't last through the day for the last several days , i 've applied my cover girl stick under one eye and the em cover up under the other eye the em has a more yellow tinge , but once i put my foundation over it , the yellow disappears by noon , the dark circles are completely back i 've come to expect it from a cheap product , but from a product that 's nearly 20 \? that 's unacceptable why would i pay twice the price to have the same result \? i had been very interested in trying michelle phan 's makeup line , but this product does not make me want to try any of her other products
5	so happy i purchased this ! smells so good ! its the real thing
5	this is a great firm hold hairspray i use it when i do an updo and i want no movement whatsoever the hold is very strong and it works no matter what the florida weather dishes out , it even works when the humidity this is my first can of shaper and i bought it at ulta a sale for 7 99 i figured i had nothing to lose because the price was so low but i was pleasantly surprised that it worked so well yes , it smells like a typical hairspray , but i'm not sensitive to it so it does n't bother me but the fragrance dissipates quickly in any case this hairspray holds all day and into the next without leaving nasty white flakes , even if i use it several days in a row if you want a hairspray that wo n't allow your hair to move , then this is the right formula for you however , when i wear my hair down i want natural looking hold that allows movement , so i use zero gravity instead it 's a flexible hold formula that has touchable , hold when i wear my hair down i want it to look as natural as possible and shaper is too strong for that purpose however , zero gravity is the perfect formula for this and now i have both formulas always on hand sebastian definitely makes good hairsprays these two formulas are all i need i definitely recommend shaper and zero gravity for all hair types shaper is strong and zero gravity is light a perfect duo
5	great product for my skin with acne
5	cnd creative nail designs shellac cake pop is a beautiful opaque neutral light pink not chalky looking as has a great shine the first time i wore it i received 2 compliments from people i did not know in a store great for summer cnd comes out with wonderful new colors every time will last longer than the darker ones , but i do love the dramatic look of their dark colors
4	great coverage i use it to conceal age spots and blemishes it works great it is easy to blend and covers well , without using the suggested setting powder since i do n't have it anyhow , it gets the job done
5	love it ! helps with oily skin and it smells like cinnamon
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	i plan on updating this in a few months of use but so far in my 3 week trial period i have noticed a softer complexion i am a redhead with fair skin and have typically dry skin this time of year \( fall winter \) within minutes , like most reviewers , i noticed the petal soft skin while i am still waiting for that miracle cream for eye bags \( yes , that 's a hint , vichy \) , i will say that my skin does feel and look softer and younger as the product promises there is a light floral scent involved , again roses comes to mind , and this is more of a very light lotion than a serum based competitor
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	mustela has been making skincare for babies and their since , and are committed to using natural products that are safe most of the ingredients they use are plant based this kit comes with 2 products one 150 ml squeeze tube of stretch mark prevention cream , and one 75 ml squeeze tube of bust firming serum they are both in easy to apply bottles with pop style tops they both have a strong fragrance that i find to be pleasant and feminine quite luxurious after a hot bath the stretch marks prevention cream is created to help prevent stretch marks during pregnancy and is made from 3 principle ingredients , avocado peptides , and shea butter the bust firming serum is made with 3 key ingredients which are centella asiatica , , and avocado peptides the ingredients are created by mustela labs , and again , are plant based , natural , and safe there are other ingredients in both products , like water and binding properties , but the key ingredients for skin softening are as listed above hypoallergenic , safe for breast mothers , and created with the environment in mind , i think this set makes a great baby shower gift the sooner a mother to be can begin applying the stretch mark prevention cream , the better \( of course , lots of people get stretch marks during growth spurts , so this cream can be used for anybody , you do n't have to be expecting \) the instructions on the box recommend starting the cream by the month of pregnancy just based on the ingredients , the reputation and longevity of the company , and the wonderful fragrance of the products , i like this set it would be ideal as part of a bridal shower gift basket as far as results , the mustela company had clinical studies that are quite favorable in their studies , 26 mothers used the stretch mark prevention cream and 96 of them developed no stretch marks those are positive results !
5	this is a fairly thick , cream conditioner and it has worked very well for me the ends of my hair tend to get dry and i 've been using this conditioner with each wash i 've noticed a big difference in how much less dry my ends are it goes on easily and the scent is mild and pleasant it takes slightly more rinsing than other conditioners i 've used , but perhaps that 's part of why it works so well it was easy to squeeze out of the tube when it was full , but it gets a little harder as the product is used up the 6 8 ounce size lasted a good amount of time since i used some just on the bottom third of my hair each time i would go through it quite quickly if i used it more overall , it makes my hair look healthy and i'm happy with this product
4	i have somewhat sensitive skin , but this cleanser did not cause any irritation it has a nice , clean scent , that is not overpowering , but pleasant it left my t zone clean and soft it says specifically that it is good on waterproof makeup and around eyes , but on my waterproof mascara , it did not take it all off
4	was n't familiar with the brand , but pleasantly surprised as others have noted the eye shadow material is a little powdery the neutral colors looked very good the glittery colors are a bit too glittery and only a very slight application of it is needed to achieve a full effect would consider this brand again
5	great shade ! very winter like
2	i was n't super impressed with this product the curve of the lipstick itself is unique , but i did n't find that to be an asset in application the packaging is cheap looking for such a high end product the color i received , shade 07 , is more brown than i anticipated and is just okay the color also wears off easily after eating drinking i will not purchase another one of these lipsticks
5	great they all are
2	i have a no frills hairstyle \( long , naturally straight and fine \) that can air dry and still look okay therefore , i have never been one to spend a lot of money on styling tools i bought this very basic , inexpensive hair dryer since i normally do n't have time for air drying it worked okay for the past 2 years it dried my hair in about 10 minutes but left lots of little frizzes on top that i would then have to smooth out with an iron it just met the bare minimum requirements for a hair dryer , nothing more i cleaned the lint filter regularly and only used it a few times a week i was therefore surprised when it shot out and smoke while using it yesterday morning i carefully it and of it i have always heard that with hairdryers , you actually do get what you pay for but i was n't too concerned with it however , since the performance of this hairdryer was nothing special and it did n't last very long , i guess it is time for at least a modest upgrade with my next hairdryer i am wishing now i had just bought a nicer one to begin with as i will be out the same amount of money , having to replace it so soon
5	this is a good color it looks somewhat darker on my nails than the product photo i do like the goth red i also find that it lasts pretty well , and does n't chip as much as other polishes sometimes do
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
4	you 'll have a hard time finding such a nice face cream like this one the only problem is the price at 50 , it 's a bit steep to spend for 1 7 ounces but after you use it , your face will feel quite soft and luxurious at the same time , do n't expect miracles
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	this is such a reliable eye shadow
4	i 've been using vichy liftactive retinol ha eyes for the past several days and though my fine facial lines have not disappeared \( yeah , dream on \) , they do seem to be somewhat fainter i have used it on the crow 's feet \( actually , i do n't have much of a problem with them yet \) , but also on some fine lines in the corners of my mouth those seem to have gotten fainter i do n't think this is a permanent thing , and would have to continue using this product or one like it to keep them at bay , but for review purposes i think it works at least a little bit you do n't get much only half of one fluid oz for 42 00 \( cost as of this review \) the delivery system is different but it seems to work o k if you do n't press it down too hard i did that once and lost my wrinkle cream to the sink it goes on smoothly and seems to last for several hours as far as the moisturizing properties are concerned and it has little to no smell which is a very good thing i hate smelling perfumed lotions all day that i have applied to my face because they make me nauseous after a while the vichy has no detectable scent
5	my wife provided the following review if you 're like me , you 've done facial masks before and did n't bother to read instructions however , after getting my hair out of my face and applying both mask pieces to my face , i realized that something was n't quite right because the mask did n't hug my face if you use a cheap mask , you can expect to not have the mask to your face requiring you to lie down face up although resting while having a face mask on is not a bad thing , you ca n't multi task after a few seconds of saying , this is n't right , i experimented with peeling the clear top layer and quickly discovered that the process is peel , apply , peel , smooth by the way , if you read the instructions , it will tell you the same exact thing i just wrote smoothing the mask onto the face is like paper eacute it 's easy once the mask is applied correctly , you 'll instantly feel a cool tingly feeling since the mask is not going to fall off , one could do household chores and such , but i recommend lying down and relaxing according to the package , the mask could be removed in 10 minutes , but can be kept on longer traditionally , mud masks should n't be kept on longer than 10 minutes due to the drying effect , but i'm a pusher and wanted to see what my face was like after 30 minutes after all , the package did say i could leave it on longer than 10 minutes peeling the mask off after 30 minutes was easy and left only a residual amount of mud which easily rinsed off results my face felt exceptionally refreshed and not dry which is what you 'd expect with a traditional mud mask additionally , i had a positive mental to continue my busy day i'm glad i took that break to feel even more pampered after the rinsing , i applied a luxurious spray toner , moisturizer , and sunscreen now i'm ready to face the world
4	when used with a foundation brush and \( or skunk brush \) , japonesque gives a flawless , airbrushed look that is so desirable right now the foundation is very smooth and light much creamier than most whipped brands the consistency is between a liquid and a powder one huge reason to apply this with a foundation brush and not fingers or a sponge you 'll want the brush to glide it on smoothly rather than it into the skin with a finger for best results after applying with a foundation brush , the coverage is excellent and smooth the stippling skunk brush , when lightly dabbed , then further smooths the makeup to bring out the powder portion and give that airbrushed feel stippling also easily removes any demarcation lines or application misses it 's a look you ca n't get with the 10 drug store foundations the feel is light and does n't coat or cake \( you wo n't have cracks with this foundation when you smile \) shade 05 is a medium darkness a light tanned caucasian , for example
5	great pressed mineral powder love it ! !
5	essie 's the lace is on is a beautiful color and has become one of my favorites nice cross between purple and magenta with some shimmer \( but not glitter \) that adds depth to it sophisticated color suitable for all ages
5	got tons of compliments on this polish i wear it on my toes and the 2 coats that i used has held up for 2 weeks beautifully i also paired with butter base coat and top coat i 've had multiple people comment that they think the color should be called , 's egg blue \)
5	dermablend quality in all colors the shade range in the product is amazing there 's something for everyone of all the is finding the proper one for you adjust for seasonal changes it has great coverage too
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	i love this shade ! and unlike many other cnd shellacs i 've purchased in the past , it has a better opacity after only 2 coats it 's so pretty , i get tons of compliments when i wear it
3	very expensive product but does n't feel like the same run of the mill sunscreen that you would purchase at your local drug store i have dry skin in some areas and combination t zone on the and apple of my cheeks it blends perfectly but when you hit the nose region i am shining for days ! you can also see it in my pores which are enlarged and black head prone i recommend using just a little bit to apply because it is thick and will feel very greasy at first once the product has been absorbed , it has a nice dewey finish except in my t zone area considering the cost of the product , i would recommend getting a sample before making the purchase as every individual skin will have a different reaction i believe that if you have combination skin and large pores this product may be too heavy as it is for my face recommend only if you sample before hand and for drier skin types
1	product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope however quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures nail polish is extremely watery , not at all glossy even after 3 coats it is not the quality i am used to when compared to other essie nail polishes
5	i ca n't yet speak to how effective the spf is , but the moisturizer is thick yet goes on light and is not oily it blends very well and does n't leave any film on your face i tend to break out from moisturizers , but have n't had that problem with this one
5	although you might have to apply multiple layers , it does not have the cake like or sticky feeling it blends well with your skin color as was expected it feels as if it moisturizes your skin enough that it does not feel dry after application it also blends well with your other makeup foundation nice product that will hide many imperfections and even some tattoos 5 stars
5	i bought a a few years ago and it came with this brush head they last up 2 3 months this particular brush head thoroughly cleans facial sin without causing redness or skin abrasion used with the , this brush is great
4	i ordered crepe erase intensive body repair treatment , along with the crepe erase body polish \( i 've reviewed the body polish separately \) i really like the thick emollient feeling of the intensive body repair product , and i love the incredible light citrusy smell it 's super thick thicker than body butter kind of a cross between coconut oil in a jar and body butter the kind of coconut oil that 's hardened at room temperature , not the oil that pours it does n't feel quite like either of those though , and the smell is wonderful ! the crepe erase intensive body repair treatment goes on so smoothly it feels a little greasy at first , but not sticky , and then is well absorbed into your skin it left my skin feeling softer and looking healthier it 's done a really good job of softening my rough elbows , knees , and feet , which get super dry during the cold dry winter months crepe erase is perfect for dry winter skin , but to be honest , it 's heavier that what i 'd use in the summer months because it would leave me feeling sweaty perhaps at night during the summer on those areas that are particularly dry like my knees and elbows when i ordered this product i did n't realize that it 's a guthy renker product i make it a personal policy not to order products from infomercials because i 've had problems with two products i ordered a long time ago which left me with a negative opinion of that ordering process since i can get if from amazon , i would order the intensive body repair treatment again next winter it 's the richest body cream i think i 've ever tried , which is great for my dry , sensitive skin i really liked the crepe erase intensive body repair treatment , and would definitely continue to use it during the winter months if it was n't so expensive i did n't care for the crepe erase body polish it did n't make my face feel clean , and left little scratches on my skin i 'll stay with the exfoliator i 've been using since my teens , st ives peach facial scrub update 8 4 2017 i still look for a cream as good as this and have yet to find it ! ! this one is a bit outside of my budget for now , otherwise i 'd a year 's supply at a time !
5	this essie is a really cool color and looks better on the nails and has cool white sparkles in it
3	i have used strivectin products before i have been very pleased in the past but whatever serum is in the product irritates by skin and after using it several days i had to stop i thinks this company makes great products and i wish this one would have worked for me but sometimes my skin can be sensitive
3	i really enjoy wearing many of the new complex masculine fragrances particularly as the weather turns colder i'm not talking about something that could be mistaken for a unisex scent , but rather colognes with heavy base notes of cedar , resin , leather and tobacco if you are familiar with the original classic eternity line \( for both men and women \) , you can probably figure out that i was never a huge fan even in warm weather i tend to avoid those beachy , scents that said , i was intrigued that the description of calvin klein 's eternity now for men included moroccan cedarwood so i thought i 'd give it a go unfortunately , it disappoints this is a very sweet , almost tropical , fragrance , with strong coconut and vanilla at the front if i did not know this was formulated specifically for men , i would categorize it as unisex i ca n't say i detected any woody notes either and , much like the classic eternity scents , it lacks the staying power of other high end fragrances and by the middle of the day , the spot i 'd applied it at my wrists smelled only vaguely talc like overall , it 's not a bad scent and i intend to put it aside for summer when it will be more appropriate but if you 're looking for a heady , masculine scent this is definitely not it
5	i have been a lancme user for many years now i have medium color skin \( lots of freckles \) i was willing to try the vincent longo ultra light canvas tinted moisturizer i really like the light feel , the color , the convenient tube with concealer , the ease of application and most of all , no skin irritation i have posted pictures to show you the similarities between the two products ! to test this product , i actually did a side by side test of my own face and even i could n't tell the difference in the picture , you will see this product shown next to a lancme product bisque is the color i truly enjoyed the product and am pleased to be able to continue using this !
5	great for toes
3	i have sensitive older skin and am always looking for facial cleansers that are targeted for this type of skin so as a vine reviewer , i thought it would be a good product to try , and compare with my usual product of choice first off , i found the scent very strong and it reminded me of the old ivory hand soap i used as a child on the plus side , a little goes a long way the first time i used it , i squeezed out a normal amount based on my usual high end facial cleanser and it was way too much so even though it is a high cost product , it is actually much less when you consider how little you need to use in terms of its ability to cleanse gently \( as advertised \) , i feel it does a good job , but it is more drying than i like however , it is more drying than my lancome facial cleanser \( lancome cleanser for face 6 7 oz \) and the price is higher than lancome \( although as i mentioned , you use less per washing and therefore about the same price \) but overall , i will stay with my lancome
4	ok
5	the actual polish is a little thicker than what i'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands i love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish ! you just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go do n't clump on a thick layer ! the polish itself does not peel or chip off easily it really adheres well to the nail bed and i'm very happy with the purchase
5	thus is great !
5	totally agree with the other , this stuff is wonderful it works so well , it cleans so thoroughly and yet does n't dry my skin out or clog my pores i tend to be a little on the dry side but i also get whiteheads and blackheads and cystic acne flareups this cleanser leaves my skin clean , smooth , but not dry and i never , ever break out best part of all \? it 's absolutely inexpensive , compared to the size of products that give you maybe 1 4th the product for three times the price for the price , this stuff is amazing , but even if it cost more , i 'd still buy it it 's that good
1	unfortunately this product did not make any difference in my oily skin i woke up everyday with different pimples i used this in conjunction with the k oh boy what a mess this left behind now i am using a product i found online , totally but mistake and is working wonderfully on my skin i wish the seller can read this maybe i still have time to return it i just threw in my junk drawer almost halfway full if this works for anyone , i would be happy to sell it to you half of the cost
5	i have used the product before and will continue to it makes my skin and helps to soften fine lines i am 48 with dry skin and spend a lot of time outdoors so this product is a keeper for me i use it morning and night it dries fast and has a pleasant smell
4	first off , i want to confirm that this is a clear glaze conditioner and does not have any color in it i was a little confused at first by the name and the bright color of the bottle and thought it might only be for also , this product can be used by anyone , not just those with color treated hair i have fine hair and was concerned that this might weigh it down , but that was not the case i did not apply it to my roots as soon as i applied the product in the shower i could feel that my hair was smoother and more slippery it washed out nicely and left my hair shiny and easy to comb i do n't think i would consider this a glaze such as those that you get at a salon , but it is a nice conditioner the scent is pleasant and i did n't notice it after my hair was dry it definitely helped control frizz even on rainy days this is a decent product , but i'm not sure that it 's necessarily worth the price
5	renewed hope is the moisturizer i 've always wanted with a thyroid condition that makes my skin sensitive to many lotions , finding a suitable after shave has been a challenge for me i 've tried too many to count many have burned my skin some have only made my face red and dry fortunately , renewed hope does exactly what i need it to do this great moisturizer nourishes my skin , smells great and helps my skin look its best believe me when i say how pleased i am that my search for an effective after shave lotion has ended ! i highly recommend renewed hope moisturizer to everyone
5	love zoya polish ! i use the base and top coat along with 2 coats of polish i can usually go 2 weeks without a chip and it is easy to remove the polish also knowing it is 5 free brings peace of mind !
1	too many large glitter pieces , just looks clumpy and cant smooth even with many top coats who wants nails \?
5	if i could give it 10 stars i would ! this is probably the best deal i have got on amazon in quite some time i love it ! for the price it cannot be beat ! just one of the items in the box alone was worth more than the cost of the box the other samples were very nice and well worth what it cost i hope that amazon will start doing this monthly or at least more often ! i am really happy with my purchase ! thanks amazon !
5	love this i 've bought this product multiple times only apply to pimple as it will dry out the rest of your skin however , i have put this on large areas of my face during summer months when my face has more oil than usual i 've had skin for a while and i consider this product necessary in my skin care regimen
2	first of all , this product has much more of an orange tint to it than is normal , much too orange for my fair skin , and even too orange for my sister who is a couple of shades darker than i am it does n't apply very easy , as far as spreading evenly and requires you to apply it in a more caked on fashion which is very unappealing both myself , and my sister could n't stand it , and it felt heavy on our face i would n't recommend !
5	my husband likes scent which is good , because i like it too it 's pretty potent when he first sprays it on and he only uses a single spritz at first i thought it might be too overwhelming but after about 10 minutes it calms down to a nice level this is definitely a manly scent , not one of those that i would borrow the scents that i pick out the most are the woodsy , sandalwood and cedar the lavender and mint are more subtle overall it has a warm and sophisticated fragrance , not one of the teen variety colognes i think this is targeted more to the or mature personality the bottle is elegant , very simple and understated it comes in a wine colored box and would make a nice gift
4	shaving with a blade can leave my skin irritated i use nivea lotions typically to try to moisturize and soothe my skin after shaving this jack black is a premium alternative it is very light and has little fragrance but it works i notice less redness , and my skin feels cooler and less raw with this product
5	it 's a great must have color for any collection it 's very classy
3	love shellac products ! this particular color i am not thrilled with its different so they are giving new color options but not a fan of light blue myself and have n't had anyone that has wanted this color yet i use it for painting on a tip line when doing glitter tips or foil tips since its getting covered up anyways
5	works great
5	i love this cleanser it does n't lather but cleanses well i have combo skin , so my t zone breaks out with this cleanser , my face feels smoother and less dry , w o it making my t zone greasy it removes makeup well and can also double as makeup remover and be wiped away i 've been using for weeks and my bottle is only a quarter empty great value for such an extraordinary product
1	never ever again in couple days of using this product my skin burning and red and i am in pain
4	the lipstick by vincent longo arrived in a pretty shade of red , but more of a pink red than i usually prefer it glides on beautifully and has a raspberry scent it is matte and i guess i prefer a little shine more than i thought i just add a little gloss after applying i hope there will be additional colors offered overall , very nice lipstick
5	my hair stylist rubbed a bit into my hair before styling and i knew had to get a bottle of my own i guess this has been around for a while why have i just recently discovered it \? ! \? it smells like heaven moisturizes , softens , shines hair does n't weigh hair down and does n't create build up i use a cleansing conditioner instead of regular shampoo conditioner combo since it is a lot milder and i have n't noticed any product build up at all my hair is smooth and shiny with volume and smells great
4	i like this of eye shadows from bliss they look well with my dark brown eyes but i think they would also look very well with hazel and perhaps green eyes , too there are 4 colors and all have a shimmer not enough to call frosted , imo the darkest color has quite a bit of copper and is not as dark as it looks when applied , although it 's still a dark brown the next darkest color is more of a shimmery khaki color the pink is quite pale and shimmery when applied and the lightest color is a very shimmery , pale champagne color these are more like a cream powder mix and glide on easily when applied i use a primer before applying eye shadow and i would suggest you do , too , as creamy type shadows have a tendency to settle in the crease of your eye without a primer it comes in a silver and white plastic case and has a mirror under the cover as others have mentioned , there is no applicator i always use my own brushes when applying any make up so this is no big deal to me but it may be to others i have no idea what the price will be so i cannot comment on that yet this is pretty eye shadow that looks good and performs well i tend to be cheap when it comes to make up so i 'll let you know when i find out the price if i will be buying it again
4	dermablend cover creme foundation is a very different kind of foundation than any i have used before i followed the directions carefully and rubbed a tiny bit of the cream against the back of my hand to soften it and it really does go on my face so smoothly i only use a bit during the day and it lasts all day i do touch it up again if i'm heading back out in the evening i have n't tried the translucent powder to set it yet , but i 'd like to it blends easily with fingers or a sponge and offers pretty good coverage the warm ivory is very light but i'm pretty pale so it works ok the warmer color works better for me than the pale ivory in the summer i 've used it daily for about a month and have only used a tiny bit i imagine this container will last at least six months , probably more my only complaint is that the makeup does settle into my tiny wrinkles and makes them appear more pronounced overall , i 've been very pleased with the makeup
4	i love to discover new scents , hence why i hound 's and tj maxx for their discounted perfumes i had never tried lacoste before , so i took the plunge , even though it said it had coconut and if there is one scent i 've grown to hate , it 's coconut but seriously , this perfume is a fantastic day to day perfume ! it 's light and subtle , a perfect balance between sweet and floral i do n't smell coconut at all , which is absolutely perfect ! this is definitely not a super strong perfume , but really , that 's good because those strong perfumes tend to get rather noxious \( and make me nauseous \) over time i really like the packaging very efficient with little waste same with the bottle while i do love my decorative bottles , i appreciate streamlined ones that fit into better overall , i do like the scent i find it very light and refreshing , more floral though than coconut if that sounds like something you want , head to your perfume counter and check it out ! brought to you by c s light
4	this is a sweet little contour palette with a mirror inside that says you 're so define and is compact enough to fit in a small cosmetic bag in my purse my makeup routine is so simple most days \( undereye concealer , foundation , blush , mascara and lipstick \) and i 've never used contour makeup , so i was n't sure what to expect as to texture , application or results the texture of this makeup is dry , but it has a velvety smooth feel like premium eye shadow i assume it 's best applied with a contour brush , but since i do n't have one i 've been using a small rounded blush brush that works fine for picking up product and blending it evenly into my skin as to results , i'm pleasantly surprised as this contour makeup is flattering as it really does the structure of my face i'm using a touch of the darkest shade \( which is quite dark compared to my fair skin \) blended with the medium shade in my cheek hollows and the lighter color on my cheekbones , and it creates the illusion that i have more defined , higher cheekbones plus , my face actually looks about 5 pounds thinner , and this makeup blends nicely for a natural look i really like this contour by bliss and definitely recommend giving it a try
5	this is definitely made for dry , irritated , very skin , and it does a very good job of correcting that my face gets somewhat red \( as it usually does \) when i apply it , but the redness goes away and it never stings a little goes a very long way , especially with how thick the cream is will definitely buy again
4	see pictures attached i thought that would be helpful to show the true color against skin it 's a nice product i did n't give it 5 starts b c i found it to be a bit thick and i really wanted something thinner and less heavy that being said it does work and it was the color i expected i am going to try it again tomorrow with a better foundation under it the packaging is nice though and it comes with a nice application tool under it it 's definitely a warm tone and would be great for highlight your cheeks as well
1	i was not all that impressed with this shampoo for the price i paid for it i like crew better for the quality and price
1	saw on dr oz so ordered it very disappointed though did not fill in at all made no difference would return if it was n't such a hassle
3	this is not worth the extra money it has a nice lather while brushing , but the ginger is totally undetectable , and the paste itself is not special enough to justify spending around ten dollars tom 's cinnamon and clove has my vote for a fun taste and good functionality sure , the packaging is pretty but it 's also not worth an extra 5 7 dollars per tube
4	4 1 2 stars gentle , non greasy toner feels cool and soothing on your face it is to be used after cleaning your face with your regular facial cleaner the toner is supposed to remove excess make up and deposits i did find on my cotton swab extra residue so it seems to be working i liked best that this toner did n't sting like other toners i 've used and is great for people with extra sensitive skin
5	i watched endless videos for feedback and comparisons of this eyeliner against other high end liners , and this one won every time it is black , did n't smudge on me i do n't have oily kids though people said it is not matte but it 's not shiny either it 's right in between matte and shiny just normal i do recommend it !
5	pleased
5	i really love essie and their colors ! ! this color is beautiful but if your looking for a neon this is not neon i do n't know why they call it neon collection i have two others but have n't used them
4	great colors does not last the week
5	it does an excellent job of improving completion and temporarily shrinking pores to slow oil production
5	good
4	love the color ! does n't wear as well as some other brands
4	very nice , that i ordered it again for my wife 's thinning hair
4	i did n't consider beard oil important , but was glad to have a chance to be proven wrong this oil has a woodsy masculine scent and does seem to make my beard more manageable
3	this is an eye cream that claims to both brighten and firm the under eye area it comes in a pump bottle which allows you to control the size of the pump to customize how much product you get out it has the very slightest of scents , more from the ingredients , i think , than any added fragrance you 'll only smell it if you have a really sensitive sense of smell honestly , i do n't think this eye cream is worth the hefty price tag it does okay with moisturizing it sinks in nicely and my undereye does feel soft and moisturized after using i'm not seeing any brightening effects , however , nor anything in the way of firming in fairness , i was not expecting much firming , but i was really hoping for some brightening
3	first , fellow that teeny tiny sample bottle is 12 oz while the real product here is 1 oz for 90 \( thank you for the person below who corrected me those numbers are very tiny ! i can understand 90 kind of for a 1 oz bottle not for a 12 oz one ! \) i definitely liked various things about is clinical , most of all that it feels very good on my skin , and is easy to apply \( i squeezed the e dropper on a finger then to my cheek there are no directions i just put a small dab , and it covered a lot more area than i expected \( about two worth \) it went on smooth and felt good , no stinging on the minus side , it 's obviously very , very expensive and , while it felt good , for me , it did n't perform any miracle unless money 's no object , i 'd think twice also , it 's tinted light blue for something on your skin , a lotion at this price , i would want to not have dyes and maybe it would n't look impressive if it were clear , but i know i would like it better
5	this is a light , smooth balm for the eye area since im in my 80s , the eye area tends to get dry , and regular moisturizer doesnt really do much to help this out i like this its very silky , and doesnt cause any problems with my eyes glad to have discovered it im not looking for miracles at this point with wrinkles and bags , but my eye area definitely looks better and feels better
5	absolutely love the smell of this product perfect amount of hold does not leave your hair feeling sticky stiff
4	this is an excellent dry shampoo that goes in well and looks great i have very fine and straight hair , and this product definitely adds a noticeable volume which is much appreciated the one thing i do n't like about this product is the way it feels when i touch my hair the texture is hard to describe , but is kinda chalky if that makes sense i 've been using it more and more lately , but that feel is the one thing holding it back from being a true 5 product in my book
5	my son has extremely sensitive skin that is on the drier side he is allergic to most products with any fragrance it is very hard finding a quality product that does n't give him any reaction or hives this mustela stelatopia cleansing cream is great it has worked great for him it literally has 0 fragrance and it does n't smell like anything it is creamy and it foams up and cleanses regardless of having no fragrance no parabens no phthalate no it is hypoallergenic as well this pump bottle comes with 6 76 ounces of cleansing cream it even works great for those sensitive little faces and sensitive enough for babies right out of the it is recommended to wash up in a lather , rinse and towel dry without rubbing to hard \( aka getting product off of skin \) ingredients aqua water eau , coco glucoside , cetearyl alcohol , disodium lauryl , hydroxypropyl guar , sodium cocoyl isethionate , zea mays \( corn \) starch , citric acid , glycine , glycerin , hydrogenated castor oil , sodium benzoate , polyquaternium 10 , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil unsaponifiables , titanium dioxide , sodium chloride , \( avocado \) fruit extract , sodium hydroxide
5	all is ok thanks
4	i would n't call this lightweight on the skin it 's quite thick , but the moisturizing aspects is undeniable my skin stayed soft for a while and the skin readily absorbed the moisturizer without being greasy unlike many suntan lotions , it does n't give off that chemical suntan lotion scent the smell is quite pleasant actually without it being too perfume like a bit on the expensive side , but the results seem to be very good after a couple of weeks of usage so far
5	this is my first time trying lotion from crabtree evelyn but i am thoroughly impressed the lotion comes in a pretty box and inside the lotion bottle comes with a pump the smell is very pleasant and i did n't find it overwhelming at all i know a couple people who are sensitive to stronger lotion smells and they were n't bothered by the smell of this lotion at all when i put the lotion on it went on smooth and when it dried , it did n't leave a greasy residue at all it 's winter in the midwest and my skin can get really dry but after using it for a few days , i can feel the difference my skin is already looking and feeling much better i would highly recommend giving this lotion a try you wo n't regret it !
4	i ca n't decide if i like the fragrance of this or not the first dab kind of reminds me of grandma but i think as it sits there it seems to start smelling better maybe more flowery i also kind of feel like it leaves my hands a little greasy in the beginning but then it feels almost silky as the time goes on i 've never been more wish about a product before i'm not 100 sold on this product although i enjoy the silky smooth feel i'm not sure i really enjoy the fragrance so i'm on the fence
5	this is a very effective moisture delivery system by skinmedica this hydrator leaves skin dewy and supple when used exactly as prescribed on the package it minimized many of the fine lines on my skin i use it just before my moisturizer both morning and evening i could tell a difference in the skin texture within 3 days my skin is very sensitive , and this product causes no irritation to my skin very little product is needed for an application , so this bottle will last me a long time
5	a squeezable tube for mascara so you can get every last bit ! i love how easy this mascara goes on , and i'm not sure how to explain it , but it dries differently than any other mascara i 've owned definite staying power , and it does n't smear ever love this stuff
5	i have many la roche posay products that i am very happy with , they work well and are worth the cost if you do n't know about vitamin c for skincare , in short , it 's excellent and produces results over time this is part of my am and pm regimen it feel great going on , a little goes a long way twice daily use get me several weeks from a tube the feeling is not greasy , but smooth and absorbs well even if you do n't use la roche posay products , vitamin c is an important part of skin care you will not see results in days or week in most cases , but you will see them
3	this is a very nice moisturizer for your eyes and lips , but i do n't feel it 's anything special i have used the product for over a week , and i see no significant improvement in lines , or firming it did reduce some puffiness around my eyes i think the product is over priced for what it can really do
5	this is a powder make up that can be used as foundation instead of using a liquid or cream this is the sort of thing that becomes a personal preference , but powder compact foundation is my favorite make up i find that it goes on very smooth and the coverage is more easily controlled i use a medium coverage for work , light coverage on the weekends , and a heavier coverage for events this foundation allows you to choose how much or how little foundation you want or need it has a matte finish and looks very smooth and natural without looking thick and heavy it comes in a compact with a sponge applicator it last all day and does not get splotchy or uneven this make up is made in the usa and i do not purchasing personal care products or anything i put on my skin outside of the us i love the look , application , and wear ability of this foundation
5	everything a person with acne prone skin would need in a box when i started using mario badescu , i forgot about any topical and no more excessive spending on dermatologist visits
3	i bought this product for the second time because the first one was so great \( 5 stars for sure \) , but this time there is something off i purchased 2 one for my boyfriend and one for myself and they both smell off almost moldy i am still using it , because the smell fades an it work well we tried it out and washing out the cap , but that did n't work i think it i in the product itself
4	very sheer coverage in this creme to powder foundation from vincent longo i usually use a liquid mineral powder , so this was the exact opposite for me the compact seals tightly and fits nicely into the palm of your hand a faint scent that is not too over powering i am very translucent and found this to be a good match for my skin in winter i do need to use a moisturizer underneath as it did cake a bit around my eyes because my skin is so dry this time of year i'm excited to try it in summer , where i'm sure the sheer coverage will be more welcome ! edited to add i used a standard make up sponge to apply and had no problem
5	great color long lasting
4	from the female of the family you can use this setting powder for a number of dermablend makeup products i got it to go with the company 's liquid leg makeup , as it was transferring to sandal straps , shorts , etc nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dermablend leg and body makeup liquid foundation with spf 25 for medium coverage all day hydration medium bronze 3 4 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dermablend leg and body makeup liquid foundation with spf 25 for medium coverage all day hydration , medium bronze , 3 4 fl oz a they say the powder will fix makeup and prevent transfer for up to 16 hrs \( i 've tried for about 8 at a stretch and it works \) however , there are two issues that made me knock off a star 1 \) applying it to two full legs , over makeup , is messy ! you could stand on an old towel i guess i have a large bathtub so i sit on one side with my legs over the tub and put it on when done , i can flush the of dropped powder down the drain using the shower nozzle 2 \) it 's kind of hard to get off ! my best bet is to get in the shower at the end of the day and scrub my legs with body wash on a brush , or rough it 's good for what it claims to do , and it would probably be a lot easier to apply and remove over face makeup recommended , with caveats
5	wonderful product
3	this is pleasant to use but not sure it is getting my face any cleaner it reminds one of a hard to this with its price tag easy charge , easy to clean an improvement over the clarisonic because the clarisonic was very difficult to keep clean this foreo brush is a nice to have rather than a must have
4	i liked calvin klein 's eternity for men it has a nice fragrance with undertones of citrus , and it has a clean smell with just a hint of spice my husband wore it and liked it too it 's not too strong and he received compliments it also lasts a long time
4	this is a really nice curling iron it 's so much sturdier in its build than the conair irons you get at walmart the interchangeable locking heads are well at least , the one that comes with this box \( 1 25 \) does at 85 a head , i have n't tried any others yet it feels well balanced in my hand and i suspect i 'll get use out of this for many years to come that said i was lucky enough to be able to get a review copy of this i have to ask myself if i were shopping for a curling iron , would this be worth the price \? i guess it depends on volume of use for someone like me , a curling iron is an occasional tool \( i already have wavy hair \) i think it is for most women i know i could n't justify myself buying this under normal circumstances as it is , the 1 25 head is n't the head i 'd prefer , but i do n't know that i will ever spring for the head i 'd use most \( the tousled waves wand \) this almost feels more like a professional 's tool someone who needs a workhorse to curl hair everyday
4	i 've never used a face primer before , although i have considered it i usually look washed out by 5pm and have to freshen up before i go anywhere again i use an eye primer regularly and do n't know why i 've never tried one for my face i looked forward to trying this product this product promises help makeup last longer provide smooth canvas for your makeup reduce appearance of wrinkles wear with or without makeup does it deliver \? i tested julep blank canvas several times over the course of a week , using different types of makeup and blush i applied julep blank canvas primer to one side of my face after using my normal moisturizer it felt a little strange , like a silicone gel it went on smoothly , but i had to apply more than i expected to for adequate coverage the side with the julep turned red and i felt a slight irritation , but it went away within three minutes i do n't believe my skin is sensitive , and this is the first time i 've experienced a reaction like this it was quick and mild enough that it did n't deter me from continuing use i applied my makeup \( foundation and blush \) as usual , then went about my day by 5pm , the primed side looked much better than the side ! it had more color , while the other side had washed away and faded i tried this several times using different foundations , and both powder and cream blush each time my face had equal results with more color remaining on the primed side i also felt that i looked less tired i wondered how my face would look with just primer and without makeup , since it was suggested on the package my face felt smoother when i touched it throughout the day , but i do n't believe it looked any different perhaps if i had oily or dry skin then i might have noticed a difference , but it had no impact on my normal skin was it supposed to plump up fine lines \? the product description indicated it would help reduce the appearance of wrinkles , so i assumed it would plump them a little i'm over 50 and have very fine wrinkles around my eyes and mouth i did n't notice any difference between the two sides of my face , or any full use day since i'm taking away a star for not living up to that claim for me did julep blank canvas live up to it 's promises \? my makeup definitely lasted much longer ! the smooth canvas helped my foundation glide on easily and more smoothly than without it did not impact the appearance of fine lines on my face works well with makeup , did n't look any fresher when worn alone without makeup i'm hooked ! i would definitely recommend julep blank canvas to my own friends and family
5	previously , my goto pomade was sticky rice by cibu i have slightly coarse , medium length hair the cibu was decent , although i thought the hold was a little weak enter baxter i have n't heard of this brand before , but i was impressed by the packaging the thick glass container felt nicely weighted and high quality the tight fitting screw on cap was nice too upon application , the pomade felt like a thicker vaseline hold grip were excellent , lasting throughout the day yet , the pomade did not feel greasy and washed away very easily in the shower i'm definitely interested in baxter 's other products now
5	i really like this very gentle cleaner it is a clear gel that smells delightfully of peppermint and tingles on your face i have acne and while it is not as strong or as fast acting as proactive does seem to help a little i have only been using it for a week but my acne is not as bad as it usually is it contains salicylic acid which is proven to help acne i like the feel of it on my face and that it does not completely dry out my skin this product is a great addition to my skin care product regime and one that i believe i will continue to use in the future if you have sensitivity and acne i think this would be a good product to try but the results may take a time to show
5	i was born blond and through the years my hair has darkened i have used this product and it has lightened my hair again not to what it used to be but it is a shade that i am much happier with i shampoo my hair , then spray this on while i finish my shower then rinse this off in 3 minutes its an easy product to use it will not make you peroxide blond but will lighten your hair nicely
3	i purchased the babyliss pro titanium plated flat iron a few years ago from a different online retailer it had great reviews , just as on amazon , so i thought it must be really good this flat iron has not been one of my favorites , unfortunately it pulls my hair with almost every pass the plates are nice and smooth though i find that the plates also do n't meet each other evenly from tip to the end this means parts of my hair are getting more heat than other parts it has a temperature setting which is always nice i wish it had been digital it is not a deal breaker for me but i do n't really know how hot a twenty five is maybe that means 250 degrees \? it also has one of the longest cords i have ever seen on a flat iron short cords was one problem i have had with other irons i hate when i accidentally step on the cord and the hot as fire flat iron right across my palm ouch ! i am happy that others have had luck with it but it was back to chi for me
4	bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do i had to use a high gloss top coat i also had to layer up to get the desired coverage i wanted i would describe the color as barbie pink and i love it
3	my main problem is dark circles , and i have not seen much change in that this is a nice rich night cream for under eyes though soaks in well and feels nice without being greasy tiny container box is bigger , then the glass container is smaller , and that is only like halfway full like of eye cream but a little goes a long way i just barely get a little on my fingernail and it 's enough for under both eyes
4	i like this essie color this was my favorite color for a long time ! i used the whole bottle !
4	i 've never used a creme gel eye liner before , but i have to say that i love this ! ! i 've also never used anything aside from black or dark brown liner and i was surprised by how much i liked this gold against my green eyes and a secret \? i am generally really horrible at applying liner \( pencil or liquid \) to my top lid , but it 's so much easier with a creme gel liner since it 's more blendable and easy to get right along the eyelash line plus , a little smudge looks good this also makes an awesome eyeshadow , but i think the gold is a little too for my taste also , i have pretty oily skin and found that it did n't last as long as i would like it to however , this is a problem i have with pretty much all creme gel eyeshadows , so nothing new here i will definitely continue to use this as a liner for a more fun look than my usual !
5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
4	by way of disclosure , i received a sample of this product for evaluation purposes this jack black nourishing oil is light and has a light , citrusy scent it 's good for various uses it can soften up dry skin or help give hair a little extra shine it is not heavy or sticky it goes on surprisingly light a little bit goes a long way a few drops , rubbed together on your palms , will let you apply enough to your hair to help down frizz my wife really liked it of course , it 's incredibly expensive maybe give it as a gift or pick up a bottle when you really need to spoil yourself
4	generally speaking , i like to use fruit scented products \( either garnier or vo5 or whatever i find on sale really \) , so i found this product to be a bit too perfumey for my taste if you like a scented shampoo and but you do n't want to smell like food , you will like this product it is not a leave in conditioner you merely mist it over your hair , leave it in for 3 minutes and then rinse it out i do n't know that i prefer a mist over just a gel or cream conditioner i find it to be a little messier in my case , since i do n't have great aim and tend to get more of it on the shower than on my hair it 's also a little boring to stand dripping in the shower for 3 long minutes before i can rinse out aside from that , i think it 's a good product i did n't see a radical difference in my hair 's radiance , but i 've only used it a few times since the last time i dyed my hair a few days ago
3	it is moisturizing but so are many other leave in creams that do n't cost nearly as much does n't do a better job than lower cost options
4	i'm not usually one for neutral nail colors , but has just enough sparkle and zip ! it wore off very quickly when i did n't use a base coat \( wonder if it 's my nails or just how rough i am on them \? ! \) butter london is great ! !
4	i have purchased several obagi products for my mom , she really likes the obagi products up until now , i have n't tried it for myself because i find these sunscreen lotion to be overpriced \( i am male \) the cool tint sun screen is nice , it blends in nicely to my wife 's skin which is lighter but also works on my skin which is on the darker side the lotion does n't feel heavy on the skin and the spf 50 is great for being outdoors and wanting to keeping healthy skin this is a great product , wife will use this , but not sure if she will repurchase as its a bit too pricey
5	living in a sunny state , i wear sunscreen daily as the manufacturer advises this is n't for your face , i only use this elsewhere because i wear it daily , i prefer sunscreens like this that do n't smell like coconut or other beach scents this sunscreen goes on smooth and absorbs quickly i expect this tube will last a while , as a little goes a long way it does n't leave me oily and is a great daily wear and great for the beach as well it 's higher priced , but for a and the many nice features make it worth it
5	i 've never used a cream blush and usually wear very little , if any , make up i decided to give this product a try though and am happy with the results my first try , i ended up putting way too much on and it looked like i had gotten a sun burn the next try , i used a just a small dab and it worked much better , giving me a little color without making me look sun burnt i like that the application is easy i ca n't use powder based make up because they typically contain corn products and i'm allergic to corn , so breathing in the little corn dust in powders is not good for me i do n't know if this product is comprised of corn , but since i ca n't breathe it in , i do n't get sick from using it i did a little research on the jane iredale company and was happy to learn that they are cruelty free and do n't allow their products to be sold in china any company that sells make up or food products in china is required to either test their products on animals themselves or pay for a chinese company to do the testing i wish more companies would take a stand against animal testing in this way
3	have n't used this product for the recommended time to see a difference
3	i was hoping that oxygen infusion night cream would be more nourishing and hydrating than skyn cloud cream , which is a decent moisturizer but inadequate for dry skin i was disappointed i have very sensitive skin almost completely lacking in barrier without my regular concoction of serums , my skin is painfully dry in the winter i was hopeful that oxygen infusion night cream would help maintain some hydration in my skin , but it doesnt do much in that department its not for dry skin it doesnt add any value to my serums this cream is lighter and than cloud cream it either contains more water or more air it goes on with almost no drag but it stings and even burns if my skin is broken i attribute this to the fragrance , which is floral and perfumey so oxygen infusion night cream is not for sensitive skin among its active ingredients in gosulin agave skyn iceland does not use silicone in its products this is the primary reason that ive been trying their products , as i cannot stand silicone on my skin , and its difficult to find a moisturizer without it gosulin agave is a extracted from the blue agave plant it is an alternative to silicone , as it mattifies and creates a velvety surface on the skin the texture is more natural than silicone it doesnt feel like plastic but i find that the agent \( probably gosulin agave mixed with oils and sugars in the formula \) balls up and leaves bits on the skin when applied cloud cream contains a retexturizer , but its not gosulin agave and doesnt have this problem neither cloud cream nor oxygen infusion night cream have appreciable moisturizing properties theyre for normal skin , not for someone who badly needs hydration cloud cream is thicker and has much more drag but , once theyve been applied , its difficult to tell them apart or it would be , if the oxygen infusion night cream were not shedding little bits of retexturizer because they both leave a skin surface they feel the same silky smooth skin and no way to tell if it is beneath the surface this is one of the many reasons that i dislike the trend to put in so many skin care products its impossible to discern the effects of the product but i am surprised that a moisturizer at this price point is so irritating and bits of itself the ingredient list currently posted on amazon is there was a formula change this product no longer contains retinol or dimethicone \( silicone \) cloud cream contains retinol ingredients water \( aqua \) , caprylic capric triglyceride , butylene glycol , glyceryl stearate , hydrogenated ethylhexyl olivate , squalane , peg 100 stearate , phenoxyethanol , saccharomyces extract , root extract , extract , extract , vulgaris \( thyme \) flower leaf extract , alba \( willow \) bark extract , agave leaf extract , callus culture extract , root water , \( cranberry \) seed oil , rubus \( \) seed oil , aloe barbadensis leaf extract , simmondsia chinensis \( jojoba \) seed oil , hydrolyzed rice bran protein , , sucrose palmitate , root ferment , ceramide np , glycerin , , , xanthan gum , sodium hydroxide , sodium , stearyl alcohol , acid , pentylene glycol , hydrogenated olive oil , unsaponifiables , perfluorodecalin , citrate , camellia sinensis leaf extract , citrus aurantium \( bergamot \) fruit extract , citrus aurantium dulcis \( orange \) fruit extract , lavandula angustifolia \( lavender \) flower leaf stem extract , pyrus malus \( apple \) fruit extract , alcohol , eucalyptus leaf extract , olea europaea \( olive \) leaf extract , \( sandalwood \) wood extract , zingiber officinale \( ginger \) root extract , carbomer , caprylyl glycol , rose extract , lecithin , potassium sorbate , sodium benzoate \( component of icelandic glacial water contains soy \)
5	great product wife wo n't buy any other kind
4	wife 's review i have straight , short lashes , and none of the many mascaras i 've ever used make them look long or full , including this one however , it truly stays put all day long it does n't run , looks exactly the same when i take it off at night as it did when i first applied it in the morning extremely waterproof does n't budge when i wash my face i have to use makeup remover to get it off i will probably buy it again when i run out
4	this is my first time trying a product like this i have pale skin that is somewhat blotchy and my cheeks are always a bit red if i have a blemish the redness last weeks even after the blemish is gone the concealer is really green and a little goes a long way so definitely blend this in thoroughly i found that it worked better for me if i used this under a medium to full coverage foundation most days i use a powder foundation due to it being quick and easy but found that the power i was using was too light and the green tint showed through too much for my i 've been using this when i wear full coverage liquid foundation for special occasions and it does n't look green but takes the red look out and covers well this product does help diminish the redness and give a more even complexion
5	simply amazing for those rub moments , smells lovely too
2	not as pretty as i had hoped
2	the dermablend smooth liquid camo , color camel is a great color match on my fair complexion i love the spf 25 protection however , im very disappointed that the medium coverage foundation coverage foundation did not work for me i followed the smooth liquid camo application instructions to a after a few hours of wear my face became irritated , started burning and felt itchy the liquid camo clings to dry areas appears caked and on my face it also made my pores appear larger than life by appearing more like white heads i'm glad this smooth liquid camo works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too
5	this is great so far ! it leaves a tightening feeling on your lips after application you do have to apply with your finger , and it is creamy , like a small jar of lotion when i woke the next morning i could feel more smoothness overall i will be applying at night , and i'm really enjoying the short term results of only 3 days very nice product
4	this foaming cleanser is not too thick and does n't overly dry my skin use in the shower to wash my face in the morning and it felt soft and clean , but not dry or tight gentle enough for my somewhat sensitive skin i'm normally a basic simple or cetaphil wash user , so not sure i 'd spring for this on a regular basis , but it is a good sized bottle that should last quite a while , and i like the foaming aspect
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	the reviews for this are extremely impressive so i keep thinking i'm doing something wrong but i find this very difficult to work with i have tried with and without primer , applied with a brush , a beautyblender , and my fingertips , but it takes forever to warm up and become easier to work with and it breaks up on my skin creating patches of skin here there i wanted to use this on days where i needed a stronger spf sunscreen but it is just too unnatural on me maybe i will try a different shade and see if i have different results
5	this was my son 's first cologne and i am sure it will be his last my family tends to stay with one scent forever , taking a few here and there , but always returning to the one that works best it has a clean light fragrance that is not heavy the spray on this bottle works perfectly everytime the girls really how he smells as well another note this size can travel with you in your baggie when you go through security i am still trying to find him a sample size when he travels for work i purchase this for him every year on his birthday and for christmas
4	nice , smooth , non glossy but not too matte longevity , wear is good and an improvement over my usual longer wearing lipstick from stila shade 07 is definitely not my shade i gave dark blonde hair and very pale but pink ruddy skin this is just too dark , as a lipstick in the tube it looks almost like black honey from clinique but as an opaque , matte it just does n't work for me i blotted it a bit and it was wearable but still very goth looking against my skin i will definitely try a different shade 07 also accentuates any yellow in your teeth \( mine are average white , and i do drink tea , but 07 made me reconsider which is never a good thing ! \)
5	love this product i have been using skin medica since the product hit the market i have very dry skin and i am very fair so how to look 10 years younger \? \? \? \? 1 stay out of the sun 2 use sunscreen everyday even in the winter 3 dont smoke i use this product along with several other product as my daily regimen 1 to treat hyperpigmentation 2 skin medica vit c 3 skin medica tns essential serum 4 neocutis bio restorative cream 5 sunscreen my new favorite it has a slight tint but glides so smoothly over your skin it acts like a primer for your makeup foundation ! 6 neocutis eye cream
5	although this is geared towards newborns , i am using it with my 2 1 2 year old granddaughter this stuff is amazing starting with the packaging it comes in a sturdy box that is perfect for gift giving next , it has such a pleasant smell not a traditional baby smell , yet very appropriate for a baby and it 's mild , not over powering the lotions and creams are thick so a little dab will do ya , so it will last a good while we have been using daily for over a week and can hardly tell any has been used this is a great baby gift set
5	great smelling mint scent makes your scalp tingle and lathers up really well with just a little bit biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until i got the abba moisture shampoo and conditioner especially for normal or fine hair , if you use the shampoo and conditioner , your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect \( with no weighed down residue feeling \) after a blow dry ! one note i will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent \( and expensive \) abba moisture scentsation shampoo it is only a little less potent you may have to use a bit more to get the same effect , but its worth the cost savings if you 're not rich if you are rich , get the older slightly better products here before they are gone they got discontinued from what i understand due to this product replacing it http www amazon com abba moisture scentsation shampoo conditioner dp ref sr 1 fkmr0 1 \? s beauty ie utf8 qid sr 1 1 fkmr0 keywords abba mint scentsation shampoo
4	i 've got the clarisonic aria and have used to regularly once or twice a week for years i 've found the condition of my skin much improved with regular use and rarely if ever have breakouts anymore this sensitive head is softer than most , but still seems to clean well , though leaves my skin a little less pink than normal good for use in the winter when skin is drier , tighter and more prone to breaking or after a summer sun
5	nice vibrant color ! a beautfully deep blue i love the quality of essie and how long it lasts worth ever penny ! !
2	this goes on white have to rub in good leaves skin shiny seems more like a straight sunscreen than a hydrating cream w sunscreen not very appealing for the face
2	i do not think that this is helpful for frizz i think that because it is solid and it felt more like a styling gel i attempted to use a small amount on my fingers and just lightly touch my hair with it it did not feel like there was anything applied i then grabbed a section of hair and smeared it on it was on there but it felt like it just stuck my hair together i did brush it out afterwards but did not feel a difference in my hair i will just deal with my frizz and fly away hair i received this item for my honest opinion and received no for this item
5	la roche posay are products that i really have great results with almost consistently the effaclar purifying foaming gel really foams up and makes my complexion squeaky clean there is no real scent which is a plus for me it helps my skin from being oily too i highly recommended this brand
5	love love love everything about my nuface this is my newest purchase love it relaxing too
5	this hand cream is true to its claims , it is fast absorbing and there 's no greasy residue after use i did n't have any problems opening doors or bottles etc after using this lotion it 's very gently scented \( if it does have any almond oil or any similar ingredient \) i ca n't detect it in the scent i like the fact that you can roll it down as you use it just like an oversized tube of toothpaste \( it is very generously portioned for a hand cream \) makes it more convenient to use plus i can squeeze it right to the point of where i need it to come out it does n't , it only dispenses pretty much exactly what you need that being said this hand cream is a little higher in price than what i normally pay for a hand cream but i wanted to try this brand i do like it , do n't know whether or not i 'll purchase it again at this price point when i can get something that does as good of a job at moisturizing my dry hands for a lot less definitely a luxury item
5	beautiful soft color !
5	if you have acne prone skin this is awesome ! love it
4	i have been using the elemis biotec skin energising , day cream , 1 0 fl oz on my face each morning after i take my shower and shave the ad on amazon tells us that elemis is scientifically proven to help increase cell energy this day cream the patent bio energy complex of encapsulated zinc and copper this lotion is supposed to energize , revive , and hydrate our skin im not sure what energize means , but the lotion does help to make the skin on my face feel revived and hydrated the product comes in a bottle with two tubes side by side with a white cream in one tube and a light greenish oil in the other when i press on the dispenser , a tiny amount of cream and oil is released onto the palm of my hand the directions call for two squeezes now that the lotion is in the palm of my hand i rub my hands together and apply the mixture to my face it goes on smoothly and evenly with a light and pleasant smell and is quickly absorbed by my skin it does feel good only a tiny amount of product comes out of the pump with the two squeezes so this bottle should last a long time earlier i mentioned that this lotion has zinc and copper in it additionally , the ad tells us that the product has a moisture complex containing , sodium pca , and cranberry seed oil a trio of acids , blended with a potent phyto and enriched with we need a dermatologist to evaluate the usefulness of these ingredients for the skin on our face this elemis day cream is expensive is it worth it \? each reader of this review must make that decision for himself or herself the only reservation i have in recommending this product is the cost otherwise , it does appear to work as advertised
5	super great product ! really does work if use other recommended product like hydration complex with it !
1	color is way lighter then posted
5	love this stuff works like a charm mario badescu has some great products and i love the drying lotion i have cystic acne that never goes away and this takes care of it i 've tried proactive , and loads of other things that could n't touch it , but this really works plus i have sensitive skin and this does n't bother it at all
5	this product gets a coveted 5 star rating those were looking for hair on a bald head should look elsewhere though you must have some hair in order for this to give the appearance of a thicker head of hair i have very fine hair and you can see my scalp through my hair this product does an incredible job of covering that it is very easy to apply and i strongly recommend you get the sprayer attachment if you have very thin hair this is definitely the product for you
5	best price around , beats the mall
5	i use this to wash off the makeup and grime at the end of the day my skin feels and looks fantastic do n't waste this product on your baby use it for yourself low lathering , very cleansing , washes off with a few splashes of water no real discernable scent my skin has never felt better not sure how mustela does it , but they make incredible products must be in the french soap making dna
3	the claims this product makes read like a snake oil made with technology , provides radiance , protection , toning and hydration for a glowing , youthful looking complexion it 's just a lot of words put together to make it sound like it really does something that said , it 's a mister the scent is nice i learned from my dad when i was a teenager that when you are sprayed in the face with water , you do indeed wake up you could probably buy a spray bottle and fill with water and a little something to give it scent and get the same results as this
3	i have another hot styler dryer and wanted a backup this is just ok it is quieter than my other one , and the harder bristles are fine for my thinner finer hair , but it does n't get very hot on either setting so it might be ok for touchups only it came packaged well from the seller and very quickly
3	i wish it were easier to find a color that works beyond that , this stick does n't cover well enough unless i cake it on , my dark spots show through for good coverage , i 've found that nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dermablend crme foundation makeup dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dermablend crme foundation makeup a nbsp works best
3	i have been fortunate to be able to test out many vichy products and have liked pretty much all of them i do like this mineral spray it cools off your face and gives your face some nice moisture which is really needed especially during the summer heat it sprays on in a really fine mist which is perfect for using to set your make up or refresh it also it has minerals in it also which i am sure is great for your skin although i do like this product i do n't know if i will purchase this again when the can runs out it is an item i can skip in my beauty routine without missing it
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
3	good foundation high coverage but be prepared to spend time blending and buffing to avoid cake face lasted the whole day on my normal to dry skin i did set it with powder the reason for 3 stars is because the color selection can be tricky i purchased yellow beige which was described as for light skin with yellow undertones , in my opinion this would be for medium skin the color range is not extensive and the difference between one shade to the next is quite a jump the ideal shade for a given individual would be a mix , which i think professionals do all the time im not so impressed that id purchase 2 shades to custom mix
4	while i really like this product overall , it 's not what you 'd call a heavy duty primer this primer by japonesque is mostly an illuminating base that can be worn under foundation or can also stand on it 's own as a product that brings out a healthy glow that said , it 's really only going to give a healthy glow for those with fair skin those with darker skin i think may find that this is really best only used under other makeup , as a primer it has a lightening effect , which i really like since i'm fair skinned , but others wo n't it smooths on nicely , and the bottle is a decently large size considering that a little goes a long way with this product it has a shimmery look which can help make dry skin like mine look fresh and dewy on the other hand , i'm not sure this is my favorite primer while it 's a nice fresh , illuminating base , it does n't have that silicone feel my other primers have had i 've also noticed this product does n't make makeup stay put the way my other primers have so if you 're looking for a good fresh base whether it is to stand alone or to go under makeup this is good , just do n't expect this to be one of those primers that makes your makeup throughout the day again , with this product a little goes a long way it is also scent free , which i like it has not caused any breakouts or rashes i would definitely try other products from this brand any questions \? leave a comment and i 'll do my best to answer !
4	the dermablend intense powder camo is an excellent quality powder foundation it gives what i would call light to medium coverage depending on how it is applied instructions say to apply with a dry sponge \( included \) for medium coverage and a damp sponge for full coverage i prefer using a damp sponge and was able to get good but not really full coverage the compact includes a sponge and mirror and is very nice quality it is perfect for around in a purse or when traveling the nude shade is a good neutral no hints of yellow or pink undertones while i prefer a cream foundation during the drier winter months , this powder foundation is perfect for the hot and humid mid summers
5	jb face moisturizer is expensive , but i finally found a post shave moisturizer that totally works for my skin type ! the moisturizer is absorbed quickly with no gunky feel or later breakouts i am completely happy with this and will reorder it meets the recommendations my barber and doctor both suggested in order to moisturize my face and care for the wrinkles ! reference age is early 60 's and i shave daily sensitive skin and tough beard jb products are proving to be very good for me
5	wow ! absolutely love it ! color is exquisite ! glided on like butter indeed no smearing or cleaning required after application and i m not a pro at this thing ! very long lasting ! shipping was fast !
3	i'm not sure about this product the consistency is like mousse i received mine in the latte shade , which is a little on the dark side it has a little sheen to it i put some on my face i have yellow undertones , but no tan if i had a tan i think this would look great but with a paler complexion i ca n't tell if my face looks kind of like i have dirt on it or darker spots it was easy to blend , so maybe a lighter shade would work better the price of 45 is way too expensive
3	this product is n't quite what i thought it would be it 's best to go online and google shellac nail swatches there 's a pinterest board that has tons of swatches to look at even then , it 's hard to match something you see on a computer to the actual color it 's a little too beige for me but i 'll still use it
1	this product touts itself as a replacement for botox , needles no more , and makes some pretty bold claims of instantly relaxes lines i do get botox , and not even botox works instantly \( takes about a week to set in \) the thing with botox , is that around 3 months it starts to wear off , and i schedule my appointments at about 5 months out so i'm always looking for skin care products that might help stretch out the results or even improve the results that said , i noticed absolutely nothing from this product i'm not even sure , reading the ingredients , what in it would be at all effective it has some moisturizing qualities , and also some acid peel type ingredients that said , i already moisturize and do acid peels , so this product is n't going to magically transform my skin the price of this is around 90 for 0 5 oz and will last you maybe 2 months i pay 250 for botox every 5 months so comparatively , this costs the same as botox , except botox actually does something for me , and this does nothing !
4	for starters this product definitely does everything everyone raves about it is an excellent light coverage on my skin \( which goes between fair and medium depending on how recently i self tanned \) and blends in it seems to soak in well an di 've never had problems with it running if i workout after applying the reason for the 1 star reduction is that i think it feels a bit chalky , almost like there is flour in it this does not seem to effect the appearance , and the feeling fades from my face after about half an hour , so it 's not the end of the world , it 's just not my favorite feeling
5	i am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked ! every product i 've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective with a great price ! i 've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out i'm a very happy customer this product is wonderful for my sometimes dry skin
4	love it , pretty color
4	silky , smooth feels light and goes on clear there is n't much of a fragrance , maybe slightly citrus it 's silky and feels like it could be similar to olive oil but not greasy it soaks in quick and works well before makeup too i noticed it felt smooth , but i did not notice any changes in my skin i did like the fact that this was organic , it made me feel better about using the product the serum comes out in measured amounts that is perfect ! overall , i am really happy with the product if i notice a change in the next few weeks i 'll update this post !
4	first off , i am loving all these reviews about burnt hair if you have n't used this before do n't start on the hottest setting ! try and start on the lowest and work your way up i have really long hair and curls normally do not stick well with any other curling iron i use the hottest setting on my hair and my curls hold all day and then some i do n't use any product and i normally just let my hair air dry because i 've been using this for years , i use it on the hottest setting and know how long to keep it in for the only reason i do not rate this 5 stars is i always have to replace mine every year or two it gets super squeaky in the spring and it hurts my ears , and it breaks really easily if you drop it \( i have tile floors \) but it works great
4	i am 70 years old and this is the first time that i have ever tried lip gloss ! it was very easy to apply and actually less messy than lipstick i do n't know if that is true of all lip glosses to my lack of experience i did n't smell anything when i applied it but that was a faint vanilla taste when it hit my lips it did n't bleed like lipstick sometimes does for me i would choose a different color because it almost matches my lips my lips are skinny so most of the time they look like a straight line i feel encouraged about how easy it was to , i am used to applying my lipstick over and over again throughout the day so it does n't bother me if it has to be applied several times a day my lips feel which is fun i need something to moisturize my lips so i am happy to try this lip gloss
5	i have been using this for about a month now before writing this review on first impression i wondered why this was so expensive it seemed simple enough of a product with albeit a somewhat strange look to it i was not familiar with this type of device now that i have had some time with it , i can say that i do appreciate what it can do it is one of those things that until you 've learned the , outs and details of it that you might just write it off as marketing hype there is a foreo following , a community of users that appreciate , refine and push the of what a good skin care regime can be i have not been an exfoliating user in the past the most i have done is an occasional olay regenerist 2 part facial cleanser there are quite a few bottles of partly used cleansing products on the bathroom closet shelf i do n't like the way most of them leave my skin feeling this foreo face brush has changed that i have found that it can turn an ordinary or sub par cleanser into a completely new experience cleaners that once did barely anything or left my skin feeling greasy , now leave it feeling clean , refreshed and tone there is a complex micro pulse technology to the vibrations that the luna 2 creates that makes it more than first impressions reveal after the first couple of uses i realized there is more to it after using for a while and trying out different cleansers i have found that i makes just about all of them work better i find it works best with the less abrasive ones you can over do it i have come to prefer a twice a week cleansing with it that works for me you can of course vary this if you press more lightly and for a shorter duration , you can even use it daily i would say my sessions tend to be on a medium scale of intensity for mid week and then the weekend session is a deep scrub i have only been referring to it as a cleaner so far , but the marketing for men is as a pre shave prep in this regard i do find most of the marketing to meet the claims i'm not sure that razor blades last up to twice as long , but it seems they do last longer perhaps they are n't having to cut thru as much dirt and whatever else is on our faces i'm not sure the reason for this i can say it does give a better feeling shave and with less irritation i'm tending to think this is because it really works the shave gel in and gets your skin hydrated well before the shave it and warm water really make the shaving experience so much the better you can use less shaving cream too i find that you can use non creams now as it tends to whip them to an airy consistency i keep it in the shower on a higher up shelf it is completely waterproof i think i have n't had any problems with it in that respect i find the usb rechargeable system to work very well everything is usb now a days and this works with my phone charger mine only came with a cord and no charger not a big deal as i am changing out one bathroom vanity to feature 2 built in usb charge on it it is the one of the so it is shock protected going to add a few more around the house too i have tried the massage feature a few times , although i must admit that i do n't really find the time for it if you are practicing a facial skin care program and are committed to it then i image it also has i would say that eating an diet and perhaps adding supplements would be a critical part of that as well do n't forget stress management too we are going thru an cold and flu season this year and i can say this really feels good on a face and sinus areas i have found the time to use it for that overall this really has turned out to be more than i first thought it was i am going to give it a 5 star rating because i really do n't have any negatives to say about it it is a bit pricey i would n't have purchased it unless a friend or professional had really convinced me of it all i can truly say is that everyone is different and results can vary i do want to be thankful for the opportunity to try and be introduced to this as i would not have known about it otherwise i guess my message would be that if you 're already looking into this then it may be worth a try i found it to not be just a gimmick or over marketing
5	such a bright cheery coral color ! i bought a few extras for my bridesmaids love the shimmer to it , actually matches the color in the bottle really well i 've had others in this shade \( in the bottle \) that look fire engine red on the nails this does n't do that love it on my toes !
5	this mitt works great with the st tanning mousse , which is a great dupe for st tropez this mitt smooths the mousse and makes for a streak free application it also keeps the mousse from staining my hands it does n't absorb too much of the product and it smooths out the mousse so i get very even coverage i like everything about it it was definitely worth the price and when this one wear out , i will repurchase another one i ca n't imagine that any other tanning mitt works better than xen tan i like everything about it and definitely recommend it highly
5	my whole family uses mario products
5	its a dark rich burgundy great for the fall or a night out it has really beautiful lights to it depth once again can apply thin does not streak
5	this is a very good top coat to use alone or on top of any color ! this shine is great and it does n't peel
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
4	good overall but is fairly heavy compared to my previous blow dryers
4	when first dispensing the formula to the brush i had to twist a lot more than 5 times then i tried twisting it the other way by the time i got it going , it was too much a big blob of color but at least i got to really go for it when testing it out the first time upon application to my bare skin , it had too much of a powdery finish i had brushed it on and it did n't get the desired coverage , yet it did highlight every of dry skin so round 2 i exfoliated and moisturized better then i patted it with my finger rather than brushing it on , then i got the desired coverage and look i would also recommend to match your skin tone well with these as the full coverage is pretty opaque when using it with a full makeup regimen , it seemed to work best \( exfoliate , moisturizer , cover up , foundation , powder \)
4	the 3 x 25 oz sampler works very well with nuface 's microcurrent devices i know this because my wife has been using one for the past almost one year and she continues to be very pleased with it if you are going to use them you will be making quite a commitment because you are expected to apply the nourisher and the smoother twice daily and the lifter once a day i have to admit that ms cthulhu is only using them before the microcurrent treatment and she 's only doing it twice a week because she 's in at this time and she 's very happy with the results her skin is above average sensitive but , so far , she is these quite well i am not a specialist and there are lots of ingredients in each of the three samples but the makers claim that the nourisher contains apple , grape and alpine rose stem cell extracts , the smoother has a long list of multi and difficult to pronounce ingredients and the lifter features vitamin c and hyaluronic acid to conclude , these are good skin treatments they seem to enhance the effects of the microcurrent nuface devices , do n't know if they should be tried without it also , best , the makers recommend that you use them together like most skin potions , the do n't work the same of different persons so , given the price , trying the sampler before making a more substantial commitment is probably the right thing to do
5	my skin loves this and it reduced the appearance of my expression line i am on my second bottle
2	i was not terribly impressed this product did not really do anything to enhance my curls , and it certainly did not help tame the frizz i think i would pass on this one

5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
2	this product is little more than olive oil and a few preservatives in a bottle with a mediocre applicator does it remove makeup \? sure , any oil will remove most makeup is it worth 20 \? absolutely not 2 , maybe if you 're looking for a much better portable makeup remover which actually has a precision applicator , i would recommend the elf makeup remover pen
5	i use this every day i'm outside all day and my skin has been super abused i think this is helping me
3	this is a popular product and i was glad for the opportunity to try it beautiful bottle \( 1 7oz 50ml \) with pump mist very nice packaging made in usa but , i was disappointed in the scent my wife likes it better than i do , but my findings flowery \( but not roses , perhaps the gardenia influence \) , sweet \( candy like \) , fruity \( citrus \) not offensive , if worn lightly , but definitely not a fragrance that i would consider a signature scent or something that makes me want to get closer to it certainly feminine , but it 's more like what i would consider an old lady perfume \( or , conversely , for a pre teen girl to use on her \) a couple of other reviewers commented that it smells like baby powder i did n't find that at all at first , but maybe over time it finally settled in to a little baby powder ish influence i think it would be more accurate to say that it settled into scent resembling my favorite gum which solves the of the curious name of this perfume sorry , i really wanted to give this a more positive review , but it 's just not for me
3	product works ! it 's fantastic sad because i ca n't take the smell unfortunately , i ca n't get past it \( that bad \) , so i wo n't be buying it again if you do n't mind the smell , it 's one of the best anti aging products i 've ever used
5	i just received this a week ago or so , but so far , i really like this product it 's very different than anything i 've tried before i use the serum first and use this on top and it seems like this product sort of locks the product into the skin i love how my skin looks and feels in the morning the aroma is n't wonderful , but it is n't bad , either just meh for this price i was hoping for the scent of and
5	this face brush is legit ! first , you need to put whatever moisturizer that you use , then wet the bristles a little bit , ok now you put this wonderful brush on your face turn it on and massage the cream into your skin ! the vibrations are n't so hard that it makes your face feel weird or give you a headache they also are n't so light that you cant even feel them they 're just right ! after using this massaging brush against my face , with my moisturizer , my face felt soooooo smooth omg i immediately wanted my hubby to rub cheeks with me i love it ! it comes with a charger and some replacement bristles the bristles brush are easy to clean cream does n't get off into them and a simple rinse off is all that 's needed i recommend this gentle , massaging face brush !
5	love love love ! stops breakouts in their tracks ! after day two of using the product my blemishes subsided , after a week 's use , my blemishes disappeared altogether while it 's an effective product for blemishes , it is also very effective for more stubborn acne as well i do find it to be drying so i do n't use it daily i usually pair it with an overnight moisturizer when used at night during the day , i 've used this layered with a moisturizer and makeup
5	i have been absolutely thrilled with this super serum elixer the name sounds like something from a science movie , but the effects are most definitely not ! after only a few applications , i actually did see \( in a 10x magnifying mirror \) a reduction of the appearance of those little wrinkles around my eyes i 've called them squint lines , but they are wrinkles just the same , and they have been getting deeper because of the quick reaction my skin had to this product , i have hope that it will continue to improve the appearance of my skin it was completely non irritating and feels like a very light oil after a bit of time , my skin drank it in the scent is very light and did not disturb me at all this serum is so ultra concentrated that it requires the smallest amount to get a full , light application i would not hesitate to recommend this to a friend or family member if you are tempted to treat yourself to a high end product for your skin , you would do well to try this one !
4	the color was too dark for my face but it looked good on my granddaughter \( 26 \) 's tanned face i was hoping for something that would take care of my brown spots and uneven skin tones , but i'm going to need a much lighter shade and that 's the tough part of ordering without testing it first the dark tones are very dark so my next order will be for one that 's very light !
4	i am really surprised to be writing anything less than a five star review from l'occitaine but i am i have to say that the scent is just far , far too strong for me to use this product on my face , so i only used it the once and i was fairly desperate to get it off my face as soon as possible this product did seem to do a good job on my face , but i just ca n't bear the overwhelming smell first thing in the morning i usually use the l'occitaine precious cleansing foam and i love that product so much it 's perfect however , i then used it to shave my legs and underarms , and it 's absolutely heavenly for that purpose my legs , who have been dry and neglected , are silky smooth and lovely right now it 's perfection as a shaving foam
2	not up yo it 's reputation
5	i would consider myself somewhat of a make up snob in that i only purchase quality department store foundations , lipsticks , and eye shadows i will pick up nail polish , body lotion , and occasional mascara from the drug store , but i am getting older and have found that the quality powders work best for my skin that being said , i was amazed at how well the la roche posay looked on my skin and how smooth it went on i have used liquid and powder foundations , but i have never used a cream foundation before i squeezed a little on my finger and it stayed in place until i put it on my face i really like that a lot it had medium coverage when i think of light coverage , i think of some skin showing through the make up and when i think of thick coverage , i think of all blemishes and dark spots completely covered this make up went on very creamy , good coverage , and looked smooth and nice on my skin i got the light beige color and found that it blended perfectly with my skin i have some yellow undertones in my skin and the pinks look horrible on me overall , i was pleasantly surprised and plan to purchase more
3	wife says i got this product for review and to be fair was not sure what to expect the perfume is to be sprayed on hair to get a desirable smell i liked the smell a lot my big concern , however , was the alcohol in the ingredient list , which may be an issue with people like me also , it is quite a pricey product , so need to be mindful of that
2	i was not impressed with this product it has all the right , paraben free , aluminum free , salt free , but the bottom line for me is that while it glides on smooth it has a tacky , sticky feel i cannot stand that in a deodorant i 've been pleased with other vichy products i 've tried , but i was very disappointed in this one i would not recommend it
4	i love the shellac system this is a nice addition to my collection of cnd shellac colors my daughter added a coat of silver vip status for a bit of glam
4	i bought this because i have very weak nails i mean they can bend backwards and with no issue whatsoever i had originally seen this item on pinterest and looked more into it on amazon i read all of the review prior to buying and made the decision to buy this matte version over the original as i do n't care for my nails to be too shiny i 've also never been one to wear nail polish on my fingernails i purchased this product a little over a month ago it arrived well packaged and in a timely fashion i followed the instructions to a t first night , 2 coats and then 1 coat every other evening i found it dried rather quickly and because it was clear , i did n't feel the need to hold up my hands away from away from everything for fear of smudges within a week , my nails were already looking and feeling better they did n't bend forward nearly as easily as prior to using and there was no way i could bend them backwards the tips of my fingernails though were weird at first , the whiteness started to disappear and then a few days later came back whiter than ever not sure why , but i'm not complaining as my co worker actually asked me the other day where i got my acrylics done so , this product worked quite well for me and i am a lifetime user now , the reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you basically have to use it forever for your nails to stay hard i decided after about 3 1 2 weeks of using this as directed to see what would happen if i stopped well , my nails grew as to be expected , but the hardness of them was gone they pretty much went right back to the way before i started using this product so , while it worked for me as stated , i will have to use it forever
4	i 've been using this for two weeks i have normal skin with some rosacea and fine lines i used this first with my nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href hyaluronic acid serum vitamin c and e hydrating anti aging for face and skin green tea jojoba oil witch hazel best natural and organic toner plus moisturizer 1 ounce by dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 hyaluronic acid serum vitamin c and e hydrating anti aging for face and skin green tea , jojoba oil , witch hazel best natural and organic toner plus moisturizer 1 ounce by a nbsp and then applied this my face was noticeably softer and looked refreshed but as i look at the price \( right now \) , i will not get another after this runs out it has the same effect as a good primer \( i recommend dhc velvet skin coat \) what i do n't see are cumulative results this does soften and fill some wrinkles but there 's no permanent results
5	essie cartel blue is a deep , rich navy blue it 's perfect for any time of the year
4	since the company that made the pomade my husband used to use stopped making it , we 've been trying to find the perfect pomade he 's got straight , very thick hair that he keeps in an old fashioned cut that needs thinning regularly to keep it from standing straight up he prefers having it back for his job , think family for style and it 's pretty close he likes pomades and creams because they can be combed through during the day to touch up this has a nice scent , and great texture it does add a nice bit of retro shine with a classic pomade look and feel where it falls down , literally , is when it 's nearly time for my husband to get his hair cut it does n't have enough hold to keep it styled when his hair is just a bit too long and thick it does n't have enough hold to pomp his hair either i think if you have medium thick hair with a texture a bit on the fine side , this would be perfect with thicker , heavier hair , it does n't hold a pomp , and wo n't keep hair slicked back without using so much you started resembling an 80s movie looking for an oil change on my hair , which is waist length and very straight , it 's perfect for sleek looks a small amount adds a wet shine and keeps flyaways under control i do like it , but because of the limitations , we are still seeking that perfect pomade
5	i used the fibers alone with no problem i just wanted to see if there was a difference if i added this product i do like the added the support of the hold but i could still use fibers alone
5	i have just used it for 4 5 days so can not judge its performance it does look like a superior product i love the lock function of its pump it will be great for travel as many bottles with pumps leak during travel ! it does not irritate the skin it is not greasy , jack black is a good reliable brand for men
5	i am very happy with the quality of the polish and the color is simply beautiful on my tanned feet
1	this will tear your face up
5	great product
5	this brand is one of the only i can use on my very sensitive skin it provides great moisture and a good foundation for makeup use it with their primer for a wonderful and natural look
4	this set up oils is a three step process you do three steps in the morning and two at night i did this consistently for a month , and still have approximately half of each little bottle left i have been a 20 year mary kay user , but as i hit my early 40s , i want to make sure i'm doing as much as i can to support my skin the idea of using oils to do that is appealing i ca n't say that i saw dramatic differences in my skin , but i like the way that my skin stayed hydrated and it did n't take more than a few drops of this product to cover my face a couple more drops for my neck
5	my cousin is an esthetician and recommends natural products rosewater being one of them i use it to cleanse my face at night i feel like my skin is cleaner and smoother it says it helps tone but have n't really seen the effects of that yet after about 3 weeks use
4	my daughter , a student in her late teens , is very meticulous about her complexion she has wanted to try a brush cleansing system , so i was pleased when this clarisonic smart profile , 4 speed sonic facial cleansing brush system showed up in my vine selection this particular system has additional settings over the other clarisonic brush systems , including deep cleanse and body smoothing , and offers better cleansing over washing with hands alone my daughter has been using this brush system for over a week now and absolutely loves it her skin is healthier looking her complexion is now pimple free and the dry flakey skin on her outer cheek area has disappeared note that she has continued to use her regular face cleansers \( vs the clarisonic cleanser \) the main of this system is its price in addition to the initial cost of the system , it is recommended to replace the brushes every three months because the bristles become less effective over time in addition , the clarisonic gel cleanser and skin polish are kind of expensive should you choose to use their products besides the cost , one other negative is that the set does not come with a stand , which would be nice to have had this not been available to us free of charge , we would have most likely purchased a less expensive brush system however , my daughter has been very impressed with the results and would recommend it
5	awesome color ! looking forward to using it
5	this stuff works ! ! has a little bit of a potent smell but it works fast 2 nights of application and your pimple is gone shrinks in one over night application
5	love ! ! ! ! pink with microglitter bought 2 bottles !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	i really love this mascara it makes my lashes huge and i do n't even have to curl them first ! the only reason i wo n't give 5 stars is because after a while it does start to irritate my eyes i do mean a while though like after hours or so it 's not really a big deal for like a regular work day but i wore this to disney world and had to rub it off part of the way through for an everyday use though i think it works great and makes your lashes really big
5	i have thick hair that tends to frizz and pouf up with humidity i prefer using a cream to sprays when styling but many creams leave a shiny gel like finish which i dislike i 've used this cream on wet and dry hair and it has performed well in both situations the obliphica gives you a gentle hold with a lot of bounce still left while it has a very light hold , it does make a big difference it adds a light sheen to your hair but does not look greasy by the end of the day it is lightly scented but it is not a strong fragrance and i did not find it bothersome the cream is , oddly enough , orange ! but it works well at reducing frizz , does not weigh down the hair or leave noticeable residue and so i am quite happy with it
5	love this colour , exactly as described wish i could give more stars since this was the fastest , cheapest shipping for any purchase i 've made on amazon , ever would definitely purchase from this seller again
5	works after a period of a few weeks , lashes clearly look longer and fuller of course with mascara applied , really a huge transformation , almost like extensions were being worn no complaints of irritation , but the product has consistently been applied carefully and with patience \( a thin line is applied daily near the base of the eyelash but not on the skin , thus as the eyelashes grow over time this stuff tends to accumulate along the length \) the end result is that it works clearly the price on this is rather expensive , but the application brush is fine and only a tiny bit is applied daily so just a little product truly does go a long way made in usa i note that the box is labeled , not available in california
5	this lovely quad contains colors that complement each other in order to make application a no brainer first there is a color called frost and found it 's a barely there peachy pink next comes tickle me pink , which is , of course , a girly pink it over is a brown taupe , time to is between burgundy and purple , yet looks more pinkish unless you build the color up all have shimmer the case is compact and chic , but the outside shows every fingerprint mirrored inner lid as is the case with many eyeshadows , these do n't have a lot of staying power \( especially on oily lids \) unless you use eyelid primer
4	this is a pretty muted purple pink with an iridescent purple running through it it has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque
3	i purchased this hoping it would give light coverage for everyday use although it did n't cause any breakouts , the coverage is not what i expected i used a sponge \( beauty blender \) to apply but it did not absorb or blend well onto my skin it seemed very noticeable that i was wearing make up and it looked like it was caked on \( i barely used any product \) the color seemed to match my fair yellowish skin tone unfortunately , this product is too thick and looked like caked on coverage the moisture aspect was good the matte look just looked bad on my acne scarred skin this product seems great for sensitive skin but it just did n't work for daytime use like i expected

5	i cannot say enough good things about the jack black brand i use the protein booster skin serum , the protein booster eye serum , the double duty face moisturizer , the dry erase nighttime moisturizer , and now this product jack black is all about making good men 's products that seem to combine both nature and science and i really appreciate that the scrub has a ton of very small , fine scrubbing particles so you do not need to use much or to press hard for the scrubbing action to be effective over your entire face also , the product smells very good , just a hint of menthol mint very masculine and subtle this scrub is good at making the skin feel very smooth and clean without using a large amount or pushing very hard at all which will help the tube to last quite some time
5	love this will never be without
5	this product is working well so far i have n't used it long enough to see a significant effect but will update after i have the cost is pricey and the results will determine whether it justifies that price i will start out by saying i am a prime candidate for this product i am seeing a few more of the little lines of late but what 's the worst are these dark circles under my eyes i remember looking at them last week and thinking i almost looked like i had a black eye on one side it was such a dark purple circle i like that this is a measured pump so it is very easy to get out without contaminating the rest of the product i have severe dry eye so my eyes are very easily irritated with creams and cosmetics i am pleased to say this cause no irritation at all it goes on easily and is not greasy i do n't wake with swollen looking eyes either , so i am very pleased so far i'm very happy but i need to see a noticeable change to justify the cost as i said after i 've been using this a while i will update
5	great
2	i had high expectations of this set , but found the colors difficult to pick up on brushes and difficult to blend not the one for me
2	too drying
3	the cnd shellac products always hold up to their name and value the color to me appears to be more of shimmery dusty rose shimmery gray color when i put it on it was a light brown color
5	i have purchased mario badescu before i like that it works well with sensitive skin this one is almost gel like and it gets absorbed quickly and deeply very hydrating thanks !
4	i love this sunscreen may be a little overkill , but i burn easy it is extremely smooth and almost melts into your skin , very easy to spread it feels light and airy it goes much further than other brands i often have allergic reactions to sunscreens if it is over spf 20 , but i do n't get a rash from vichy that 's probably the main reason i will continue to use this one it also does n't feel or look greasy , which is another pro smell is n't too strong oh , and i usually apply every 60 90 minutes , though they do suggest reapplying every i do n't like the price , but i ca n't argue that this is n't worth it
4	this curler performs much like the old fashioned curler it 's after i ca n't really tell a discernible difference when using the moisturizing pads on this device it curls exactly as well as the old models , with much the same results it 's good if you need a curler
5	i loved this nail polish , i had seen it around the blogosphere and was so excited to try it ! i ordered three different essie polishes , and they arrived before scheduled time ! highly recommended seller !
4	this product comes in an elegant , easy to open , jar a spoon comes with it , in order to easily remove the product from the jar the masque , itself , is a thick cream having the consistency of paste it is not greasy it has a light , somewhat floral scent the masque goes on easily i found that i did n't have to use a lot of the product either because of its consistency , it is easy to apply i divided my very long hair into sections to make it easier each strand needs to be covered , and using a thick comb to distribute it evenly is helpful now , for the results it did tame the frizzies , but it did n't get rid of them all together it did improve the quality of my hair it felt softer , stronger , easier to manage it seemed to be hydrated without feeling greasy the product contains essential fatty acids , jojoba oil and vitamin e , all ingredients that are vital for healthy hair
4	i have been looking for a good tinted moisturizer and this one came close unfortunately it was too dark and very shiny \( too dewy \) i did like the coverage and the feel of it , but i had to return it
5	beautiful , long lasting color what more can we ask for \? my very favorite color
5	i was dealing with problematic breakouts on my back and chest that were n't responding to my normal tea tree oil body soap decided to try this on the basis of a recommendation from a friend , and this has cleared things right up ! it 's also very gentle and smells good
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	first , i meant to order the 1 curling iron so i'm going to give you the circumference of the 3 4 one which is 2 7 8 when i hold the measuring tape up next to the barrel it measures 3 4 my hairdresser cut my layers a tad too short last time so my mistake worked in my favor i 'd be burning myself quite often if i was using the 1 size i have a 1 hot tool curing iron , just like this one , that i 've been using for over 6 years my husband replaced the plug once because i had to keep the cord plug to get everything in the proper place for the curling iron to stay on recently i began having problems with the cord again , but this time it 's where the cord attaches to the handle that is why i was ordering another curling iron this new design is supposed to prevent that problem only time will tell i will update my review if necessary these irons come with two extra springs i did n't have to use the extra springs with my old one , but i'm very happy the extras are included \( we 've had to replace the springs in other curling irons i 've owned through the years it was never easy to find a replacement spring \) the temperature settings numbers eventually wore off of my old one i'm expecting this one to do the same because they 're applied in the same manner i have a favorite setting i marked my old one with a silver permanent marker so i 'd know which setting to use although these curling irons get very , very hot i do not will not use the higher settings for goodness , my hair is n't made from fyi my hairdresser recently burned a section of my hair off when her curling iron was set too hot thankfully , it was in a hidden spot , i do n't have long layers , and i was able to cover the burned off hair until it grew back anyway , let that be a warning to you it can happen i 've used curling irons for years years years that was a first for me my hairdresser i use the 7 temperature it 's the first setting on the category my baby fine hair is extremely hard to curl if this curling iron lives up to its predecessor , i can expect many more useful years out of it and , soon , i will be placing an order for the 1 size great curling iron !
5	i used this as an extra top coat and i noticed it is better top coat than the salon top coat the ends of my nails , the color did not and flake off as quickly easy to apply , typical for most top coat not cheap , but there is a noticeable difference in keeping the color on longer time saver for me , who does not have enough time for weekly manicures
5	this product looks natural , stays in place , and works to cover the scalp and thicken my thin , fine , hair i use it everyday
5	this serum does a good job moisturizing it has excellent coverage two drops from the dropper are enough to completely treat my face , with a bit left over for my hands it absorbs quickly and does n't leave an oily residue very clean application it seems to have a slight effect on acne i have a chronic blemish that comes up on the side of my nose where my glasses rest , and after using this for a few days that has reduced considerably \( its not gone , but the reduction is ! \) over all its a decent product
5	the best
5	i was skeptical about this face wash there is literally nothing to it , it 's a clear slick gel the tiniest pea size amount will glide all over your face while you cleanse and massage giving yourself a but of a spa session it rinses off and my skin feels soft , not dry at all it feels like i am cleaning with a moisturizer but it is not oily at all and my sensitive skin is responding really well plus this bottle is going to last me forever !
4	i purchased this product because it is medical grade toner for oily and acne prone skin it has only 2 acid , but it feels much stronger i use this toner in the morning and at night after cleansing the skin it definitely controls oil production and keep skin blemish free i used to be devoted to obagi products , but ever since i finished my , i am finding myself drawn to try other medical grade products one of the biggest competitors in medical grade products with this line is neocutis and is clinical i love neocutis skin care and is sunscreen products obagi has unfortunate fallen down the list still good products , but when it comes to the price , i am convinced that there are others that are price competitive and superior in quality i will still buy obagi if i find a good deal , but unfortunately it is no longer my first choice i would still recommend products from this line to anyone
4	makes my brows seem to grow in thicker but not my lashes too irritating for use around the
3	nice clear and not sticky goes on smooth with all the yummy stuff on the label i expected a strong yummy scent but i could n't really smell any distinctive scent time will tell on the wrinkles part
5	the color is amazing perfect for fall as with most essie brand nail polishes , you 'll need to apply 2 coats and it only looks good for a few days max the color is awesome though
4	bought to cover bruises and spider veins from an injury on my leg i picked what i thought would be my color online , but it 's impossible to truly tell , and the color is darker than expected i would recommend matching this in person in a store somewhere before ordering online i put on two coats and it faded my bruises but did n't completely disappear i needed to build up a few more coats to achieve complete coverage , but then the coverup was obvious because it did n't match my skin tone so i settled on just fading the areas i was trying to cover i like that it comes in stick form and is easy to use i did n't know i would need setting powder and tried my regular facial powder , but it did n't work well so i'm trying to avoid rubbing off the coverage until i can order the dermablend powder
5	not as dark green as my screen showed so some disappointment there it 's more of a dark teal but that 's a monitor issue pretty color and i find that overall zoya dries quickly , lasts well and does n't chip easily
5	excelente
4	out of the trio , my absolute favorite was the milk and honey it was absolutely heavenly i would buy a truck of the stuff ! my next favorite was the lavender it had a lovely smell and lather my least favorite was the hibiscus i did n't really love the smell the bottles are a bit on the small size , they are not the usual club size barrels of product , so do set your expectations they lather well , especially if you have a jet tub or a i think , all things considered , that this would make a great gift for a teacher or the like zero skin irritation and perfect for shaving , too all in all a very solid offering from ahava , the dead sea company
5	unfortunately , this mascara was totally ruined by the time i received it as you can see in the photograph , it was damaged in transit not the fault of the manufacturer , or even of amazon , it seems that i live in an area where many packages simply get crushed anyway i had been so looking forward to testing this mascara and reviewing it , that i simply purchased a tube i'm glad i did , because this stuff is just fabulous they say a picture is worth a thousand words please look at the photographs of my eye with and without this mascara i did not use an eyelash curler , either not only does this mascara darken and lengthen lashes , but it has also curl them and kept them curled all day some lengthening mascaras will only lengthen and not thicken , but as you can see , it also thick into my lashes the photo shows only one coat of mascara , but this formulation is indeed buildable two or three coats really thicken lashes for a glamorous look
4	love pca products
5	people just keep giving me compliments , and i'm not going to lie i love it
4	i really like this but it dries out the skin just a little bit but it 's really neat to see how it affects your skin it actually changes colors a little bit on oily parts of the skin must be how it reacts with oil every time you use it you just have a nice clean healthy feeling
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	i have thick , coarse hair i 've been using this for a couple of weeks and i have noticed a huge difference already in the texture of my hair the biggest thing that i 've noticed since using this is how soft my hair is now i use one pump of the oil and apply it to the middle ends of my hair the first time i used it , i also applied it near my scalp , but i did n't work it in well and i had some flakiness later since then , i have only used it on the middle and ends and have n't had any issues with flaking the scent is a mild floral fruity smell it 's not overly oily or greasy in fact , when i am finished working it through my hair , i just rub my hands together and my hands are n't greasy at all if i do n't have to wash my hands to get the product off i have n't noticed any difference in the amount of time it takes to dry my hair it 's summer vacation , and i am letting it air dry most days in addition to softer hair , i can run my fingers through my hair without any difficulties my hair is also shiny and healthy looking since using this oil
5	boyfriend loved it i love it he smells great ca n't keep my hands off him
2	i could n't wait to get this lip butter after hearing so many people rave about how good they were i must say i was n't impressed , especially for the price ! i will stick to my nivea lip butters
4	this is a lovely bag they clearly put a lot of attention into how it 's put together , and little touches like the jouer name on the zipper pull the color is feminine without being too extreme , and the shape is just unusual enough to be interesting without being bizarre the leather itself is quite thin , which makes it very flexible and lovely , but also not exactly something i 'd want to toss into a gym bag then again , this seems like the kind of thing that 's designed to keep your most precious and expensive cosmetics safely together so that you can grab them all at once quite easily and they do n't look like a mess on your vanity it does n't really strike me as something that was designed with the idea that it would be going through anything that called for a particularly rugged bag it is large enough and pretty enough that i could see it as a handbag in a pinch , but that 's not something i 'd buy it for as a primary use the leather is thin and flexible enough that it 'd be easy for it to end up looking and a bit sloppy if you were n't very careful with what you packed
5	i love cnd vinylux works as promised does not damage my nails like gel does easy to apply and fast drying
5	great ! amazing ! !
3	i'm not sure about this i feel like ever since i started using it i became very congested all over my forehead i also do n't see dramatic instant results like it claims i was very disappointed by this i wo n't repurchase
5	this little julep green tea konjac sponge works miracle on my face i never thought this slippery sponge would do much , but after cleansing my face with it , it becomes unusually smooth it comes hydrated with a string for hanging , and a hook with a suction cup to hang it on the bathroom tie or mirror i recommend it
1	not authentic ! does not work like the real ones ! piece of junk
4	darker then i expected , but covers good and does n't run , really recommend it for a darker smooth skin look
5	i have never found a foundation no matter what that i was pleased with but i am on my third replacement and have wondered how i lived without it i do n't like make up this is very natural love the concept behind jane iredale products as well
5	this cleanser has become my new favorite for my sonic care face brush , although i use it every other day and use a more moisturizing soap in between , as this can your skin if used daily the ingredients list is basically a list of plants , which is always a good thing in my book , as plant based ingredients tend not to leave waxy residue , which can add to clogged pores
2	2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no !
5	most thickening shampoos mean a dry scalp , and what 's hotter than a guy who 's constantly scratching his scalp \? hot ! but this stuff does n't seem to result in dry , itchy scalp i use it daily with the conditioner , and my hair looks pretty good \( even for an old guy \)
5	having used this product for over a year , finding the larger size available on amazon is a huge money saver for me thank you ! however , an important fact to remember on the label , it states avoid if used extensively with each application , be sure to wear a dust mask the tiny fibers will irritate your nasal
5	love them own two plan on getting all blends into shadow perfectly i use them all the time cute packaging also
4	these cleansing cloths are nice ! you simply rub one together to start a bit of foaming action , then gently cleanse away your makeup really effective on waterproof mascara they say there is no need to rinse afterwards , but i do light fragrance , but not overpowering
5	i wanted my husband to try a new way to style his hair but we 're totally lost in the realm of what seems like endless varieties of pomade i'm glad i got this one it leaves his hair soft and not sticky , yet keeps the style nicely i will keep purchasing
5	great color ! goes on smooth , dries quickly and chips much less than similar brands !
4	so i love essie and the color was rich and beautiful , though the picture is not really what it looks like in person the color is more of a pink , then light coral it took almost three weeks to be delivered
5	this stuff seriously lasts a full two weeks with no chips or cracks but you better make sure you use sunscreen on your hands and feet before putting them under the light or you could end up with varicose veins !
5	love it ! great scent and smells wonderful on my wife ! ! !
5	any product i have bought from badescu has been really good this cleanser contains glycolic acid which is very good for your face it lathers really well with just a small amount
5	great gray if that 's what you are looking for more gray than silver but still cute
4	love butter polish this color was just a bit light for me has shimmer to it but is light even with 2 coats
4	i have never used any kind of blemish clearing serum before i never needed one before either when i saw this offered in my vine , i thought i 'd try it especially since i have been dealing with some blemishes due to the weather changing , age and stress i did n't have a lot of blemishes , but the few that i did have cleared up right away and my face actually felt better than it has in weeks i have sensitive skin , with the occasional reddening and this works like a charm it did n't leave my skin dried out it cleared up the blemishes and tightened my pores even i really enjoyed it and am willing to pay the price for it too i am not much for facial cleanser since i feel that they promise results that are not usually backed up by facts this one though has changed my mind and will definitely check out the rest of this collection i do like how it feels on my face and it also leaves my face feeling clean i do n't get that feeling with a lot of products
5	love this color and love essie products i have long natural nails and essie is my favorite reasonably priced polish for natural nails
5	we ca n't go wrong with ellie can we \? i love this and so will you
5	this stuff is really adding some moisture back around my eyes , in the time i need it the most winter ! it is a tiny little bottle of blue gel but it really does n't take much to go around your eyes i usually use a half of pump each time i have been putting it on before i go to bed and have noticed that my lines are less noticeable and some of the bags under my eyes are going away this a winner in my book !
5	got so many compliments with this color it is the perfect nude polish works great with the uv light and shellac system
3	average diaper rash cream it is not as thick as some of the maximum strength lines it is smooth and easy to apply and has a clean scent it has a flip top cap which is easy to open and closed one handed we have n't been able to see any better prevention healing of diaper rash with this cream versus any other brand we have used
4	bought number 1 smell is subtle it 's there but for the price , does n't justify it it 's a great smelling candle but i feel as if the box has a better aroma if you 're aiming for your pad to smell like the baxter barbershop in west hollywood , this candle is a good start
3	when i read that this bronzer gave a natural glow , i did not expect it to have bright sparkles in it i'm not of an age to do sparkly makeup and actually , even when i was at that age , i did n't go in for sparkles yes , i did look at the close up picture of the make up on this product page , but i just did not make the connection the inclusion of tiny sparkles in this bronzer is a disappointment to me neither the words natural , radiant , sun kissed glow , not the pictures , to me that it had so much sparkle the color is fairly well represented on this product page it may be a touch lighter than i expected , but barely it is easily picked up by my brush , and it applies effortlessly and smoothly i am enjoying the other bliss product that i have , exglowsion serum foundation , but this one is not for me
4	this is a lovely fragrance it is very feminine with a very floral base i tend to stay away from florals because they are often very sweet , but this one is just a very nice light fragrance it is well balanced and would be nice for every day wear the only downside is that the scent seemed to be very light and did not last as long as i would have expected but the scent is lovely !
3	this review is from the wife i ordered this based on all the great reviews about how well it curled how long the curls last i had a 4 revlon lash curler this one works exactly the same if i had known this ahead of time , i would have saved myself a few dollars would not order this again my lashes stayed curled about 30 mins after using it , but then flattened back out again i 've been using lash curlers for over 10 years now , so i doubt it is user error
5	very good product , fast shipping and have used it before , color is good for blondes , very good as far as using it to cover spots
4	the nail polish itself is great but i did not like the thin brush a bit difficult to apply
5	do the treatment , use the shampoo and this conditioner ! ! and you will see the difference in your hair ! ! you will be the next one to recommended !
3	after a little over 2 weeks of using this product morning and night , i have n't seen any benefits to my oily skin compared to using no products so , it has n't irritated my skin , but it has n't helped with blemishes , either it does leave a smooth finish and works well as a primer under makeup i like the fragrance although i generally avoid fragrance as a potential irritant i will look for products that do a better job keeping my skin clear as a lightweight moisturizer or primer , this is ok but other products might be better suited
5	so far i love it great coverage without looking cakey it does n't have a super matte finish , just perfect for natural looking i use it in my t zone and under eyes and it does n't sits in the lines and pores it does have soft focus finish great for touch ups \( i use fingers , blends fast and beautiful \) shade 2 is perfect for my 20 25 complexion , it brightens me up it has yellow undertone and it is lighter that in the package
5	this is the exact colour i wore on my wedding day and have been trying to track it down ever since i did three coats since it is a neutral colour colour is soft and beautiful
5	pricey but hydrates my dry skin with no acne or other side effects leaves my skin feeling soft and visibly brighter
5	i 've used this scrub on my face and elsewhere in the shower it leaves my skin feeling very fresh and smooth seems to take off a yucky layer of skin without being overly irritating or overdoing it the scent is really nice too masculine but subtle not over the top or too perfumed a nice product 5 stars
5	i actually came across this sort of accidentally see , i was removing some dark red nail polish from my fingernails , and it left behind this really awesome pinkish hue no , i did not use a base coat , and yes , i do realize the pinkish hue was a stain but this got me thinking i would pay for this look i had no idea if i could replicate it , and it was a little uneven so i thought , would n't it be great if there was a nail polish that could give me the same effect \? ! turns out , there is it 's essie 's pink glove service i ordered it a couple days ago , received it today , and put it on my nails are adorable they look so natural and feminine ! i would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic , elegant look for their natural nails \)
5	when i read that this smooth liquid foundation helps cover problem areas such as rosacea , which gives me a red nose , i was excited to try it the squeeze container helps the foundation to distribute easily , but there is still the potential to over squeeze the foundation applies easily and blends well despite the color being a shade darker than i need still , i'm impressed as it seems to do the job , which is to hide my reddish nose that said , my associated white spots could still use some extra shading dermablend suggests setting the foundation station with their powder , which might help any to things like my phone , but i have n't had any other issues with the foundation coming off or smearing , even when sweating i spent the day outside , very hot with decent cloud coverage , but i did n't notice any darkening in skin tone the next day , so i 'd say the spf works well all in all , i was impressed by this recommended
4	nice packaging on the box pull the bottle out and it looks elegant , but the stars that wrap around the bottle is like a collar and are plastic and they move , so it comes off a little cheap the smell at first , you may want to shake it , but it has a strong alcohol odor but spray on the skin and it has a different tone let it sit for a little and it picks up a sweet smell that is pleasing juicy couture fans will want to this up but the unassuming consumer may feel this is average or better than average smell
5	love
5	i am a huge dermablend fan having struggled with blemishes my whole life , and still buying acne stuff though i'm now on , i know my cover ups and concealers , and for my money , there is no better line than dermablend so many concealers fail to conceal so many do n't adhere if one 's skin is even slightly oily so many disappear as soon as one 's skin gets moist none of these things is true of this concealer it covers red places and other discoloration completely , regardless of how moist and or oily your skin is , and it stays there , continuing to conceal for hours i usually use a light powder over my foundations and concealers , so that may help it have staying power , but i do n't doubt it would be long lasting even without the powder five stars
5	my husband has been using this shaving gel for the past week , and he really likes it it 's gentle on his sensitive skin , and provides a nice , clean shave the pump dispenser works nicely , and dispenses just the right amount for a full shave of the face and neck
2	i love this brand but this product doesnt with my skin so sad i tried it three times and everytime out really badly after each use made my skin soft though
5	part of the new 2016 summer colors another great nude for a fast , fresh home manicure love it
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	this top coat does strengthen the base polish while my polish alone can go for four five days before chipping , adding this to polish lengthen it to a week this coat goes on well and evenly this is a great addition to the home manicurist
4	it seems to be working really well it is a bit pricey but have been keeping my nails from breaking so it is a win
5	the serum feels wonderful and tingly on a clean face as if it 's waking up your skin i 've used the somme line for a year , very good
2	color is ok , but absolutely no lip plumper ! doesnt stay on that long
5	wonder how you ever lived without it you will be wondering a lot , it 's big if you see the picture and think too expensive \( ok it is expensive \) , but it is also perfect and it will last because of the amount you will use , i 've had mine for 4 days now and my lips are better i use it along with palmers lip balm \( check it out too \) and you ca n't go wrong already ordered a limited edition set in red velvet that comes with the lip slip from sara happ as well and i know i will be buying this forever recommend 100
3	first impression of eternity now deodorant was good enough , it was nice scent , a clear stick that goes on clear the stick is circular and after using it i realize while others are shaped because those i can do one wipe up and down to get enough coverage , but with this circular shape i felt like i had to swipe four or five time to get complete coverage then i tried this on a sunday and but by the fourth quarter of the football game i noticed the scent starting to fade which is not good for a big brand name deodorant when some cheap general store bought brand usually last until bedtime i guess this is fine to put on before a dinner party \( it would probably go well with some calvin klein cologne too \) but it is not very good if you are putting in a long days work , or even a lazy sunday in front of the television
5	i love their products ! so easy to use and it does last for a minimum of 2 weeks , if you apply it the way it , though , sometimes , i do change color once a week , not because it has chipped , but because i want a different color it really does go on as easily a regular polish and it soaks off in about 8 minutes just follow the directions and you ca n't go wrong !
5	great
5	excellent dry shampoo ! great scent does the job effectively without showing unlike baby powder or you use very very little so this lasts a long time perfect for those days when you just do n't have the time for a real shampoo
5	love this bronzer perfect shade summer glow my favorite ! ! !
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great color if you are fond of the new green colors shipment fast and i am satisfied with this seller
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
3	i love the pure white look of this candle and the simple branding that does n't overwhelm the fragrance is nice not overly powerful , but noticeable , but is a little too patchouli and oak based for me to love it i tend to enjoy more fruity and dessert based candles , which is probably why this one was n't my thing of course , this is pretty pricey for a candle , too , though you can definitely also consider it a little piece of decor \( which you ca n't say about every candle and every brand \) it would look great in a pad , too !
4	the color was darker than i expected , but it turned out to be a very good match i am normally the 2nd lightest foundation color and this foundation was no exception , the color worked for me it is easy to apply and glides on like a dry silicon mousse \( best description i can come up with \) its not wet or oily , its silky smooth the final appearance is definitely an amazing matte coverage the foundation is also heavy on pigment which allows for applying less product to get good coverage i break out easily and this foundation did not cause me to have any issues what i did n't like is that is seems to sit on my skin and if my collar or clothing brushes against my neck or face the foundation comes off onto the fabric no matter how long its been on my face
5	this is a really good hand cream if you like lily of the valley macadamia nut oil , avocado and shea butter make it really moisturizing the scent is citrus with floral , lily of the valley , tiny hint of jasmine rose it 's very clean , fresh feminine smelling to my nose reminds me of spring you have to like fragrance in your hand cream to wear this since it does have a noticeable scent that lingers it is a heavy cream but it does not feel too greasy and it melts in to my skin quickly this is a small tube which is perfect for keeping in your purse or for travel
5	once again , the balm themselves i am so happy with this brand this highlighter is perfect for any special event you might have it lasts a long time and has great shimmer this will definitely become my go to highlighter for all my clients i have n't tried it yet as an eyeshadow , but i bet this can used as an eye shadow too
5	great color ! i love it too bad it 's discontinued
5	so cute
5	usually i lol at the directions for the bliss products , like do 50 after putting lotion on thighs it kind of reminds us old people of little liver pills the directions to take with 8 glasses of water \? however , this time i was n't messing around or laughing at directions i have noticed that my 53 year old skin is a little wrinkly in some places \( we shall never speak of this again \) it is n't that it is wrinkly but it looks dry and drinks up lotion like water in sand my skin sucked up this lotion while it was changing right in front of my eyes i am running off to see what other places i can put this
5	this product goes on easily when applied with a mitt that can be purchased separately that provide easy streak free application because i was testing this product , i applied it to one leg from thigh to ankle there was an immediate change in color once my leg dried as promised , this tanning product had a nice scent , did not come off on sheets or clothing , and provided a nice tan without being too extreme the tan does fade slightly after a few days which recommends re treatment once a week since the color is neither orangey or too dark , i will probably use this on my face , neck , and arms for an overall tan this is a nice and easy to use product and substantially better than other self tanners i have used
4	i really like the way this makes my skin feel soft and supple , without being greasy i use it under my makeup and it has no negative impact on the longevity of my makeup wear all in all i am pretty happy with this product !
2	i had heard of dermablend makeup , but never tried it until i saw it available in the amazon vine program dermablend is makeup that helps hide imperfections , major and minor i was interested to try it because i am getting dark spots on my face from past sun exposure my daughter also wanted to try it to cover the few pimples she gets from time to time we also had an opportunity to try the dermablend intense powdercamo based on description and reviews and cost my daughter and i hoped the dermablend smooth liquid concealer makeup would do a better job of hiding our flaws than our usual concealers however , we both found this not to be the case we had the same disappointing results with the dermablend intense powdercamo obviously , skin types and imperfections vary by individual , and some people may find dermablend makeup effective on their skin however , based on its price and our personal results , my daughter and i will not be buying dermablend products
3	the color is a bit darker than what i expected and i feel like it is a fake essie bottle , because it is different from what i bought in cvs
5	16 hour coverage with no flaking , wo n't settle into creases , and if i make sure to use my murad matte primer , then i wo n't get an oily face either
1	this made my chest and back acne worse than i 've seen it in a long time granted , maybe my body had already planned to freak out in acne before i started using this however , it did nothing to help the situation i also made the mistake of using this on my lady parts which proved quite irritating ps the smell was not good
5	this is a very good brand of gel i recently bought this whole line , my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails !
5	a sun screen that delivers what it claims to do ! it 's clear , has no fragrance \( which is important to me as i dislike any product which interferes with my perfume \) and goes on easily the fact that it is a broad spectrum sunscreen gives my skin great protection and hopefully will discourage any more wrinkles all in all , a very good product which i'm enjoying using
4	so far , a pretty good dryer the cord is long but it 's not professional quality like the that i own the controls are a bit odd too many heat choices , but easy enough to figure out once you find what works not a lot of info on the but at w , it will dry quickly , which is the point of a good blowdryer love the cool blast button for professional styling
4	i love almost of mustela 's products because they work so well so this is n't the first of their products that i have tried , and it certainly wo n't be the last their products are n't organic , but they are at least paraben and phthalate free and hypoallergenic actually , that is one of the big reasons why i use their products not only for little , but for myself i have terrible dermatitis and psoriasis on my hands , and mustela products are one of the very few that do n't make either worse even natural products like california baby have caused reactions , so finding one that does n't make cause any reactions or flare ups is rare this baby skin freshener is no exception to the mustela products i have come to love it works great to clean off dirty little hands and faces \( spray a cloth or napkin first , of course , not the kiddo directly in the face \) it cleans without drying or leaving a film on skin , and the scent might be a bit strong at first but it is n't unpleasant and it fades very quickly the spray also works well for adult hands and faces , as well as for use as an after using the bathroom spray the spray does a great job at getting off sweat , grime , sticky foods , milk mustaches , dog , huge diaper , , light makeup , and more the downside to this spray is the cost holy wow 30 \? i love this spray , but is it worth 30 \? , no i have no idea why it 's being sold for 30 here as it is only 9 on the mustela website , even cheaper on others maybe the price will come down here , which would be great , but right now it 's that they are charging this much the stuff is good , but
5	my hair is long and color treated it 's also wavy curly and can really frizz up when the humidity kicks in i applied it to the bottom six inches or so of my hair the most heavily , and only slightly to the rest i was quite pleased with the results my hair was only slightly damp , so when it dried i saw the actual results the comb slid right through my hair it was soft , but not limp it really felt nice i used a flat iron to achieve my regular style , and my hair had amazing shine when i ran my hands through my hair , it was not full of static , but looked fresh , with no greasy look this product is certainly pricey , but just the slightest amount goes a very long way i can well imagine that it could last me for months ! as expensive as it is , i would invest in it again , considering the price per application is affordable i 'd recommend oribe to anyone looking for a high quality product with excellent results
5	skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil is a very nice cleansing oil even though my skin tends towards oily all on its own , it is very sensitive and harsher cleansers designed to remove oils end up sending my skin into oil production causing hideous breakouts cleansing oils , like skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil , because they are so gentle on my skin , cause zero breakouts skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil is a very gentle cleansing oil with no discernable fragrance that i could detect like most cleansing oils , it works best massaged into dry skin \( the bottle recommends a cotton ball \) and rinsed off with very warm water this cleansing oil works great as a make up remover , especially around the sensitive eye area it is also very moisturizing this product is probably best for those with dry or sensitive skin other people with oily skin may find it to be too oily , but for my sensitive skin , it has been just what i needed to leave my skin feeling and looking calm , clean , and soft i love it !
4	this vitamin c packed product is gentle in the face and smells fairly neutral i'm not sure it is a miracle cure though the main reason i reduced it by 1 star was because 20 for one fluid ounce is a bit steep in my book however , if your face is really worth it , go for it
5	i have to admit , before i even tried this stuff i was writing the review in my head about how it works fine , but come on can it really be better than the stuff that 's 1 3 the price \? i have to admit that i'm kind of shocked it is a really great moisturizer , and much to my surprise , the little crow 's feet around my eyes are less noticeable after only a week of use that 's got to be worth something ! i'm just not sure if it 's worth the price of this moisturizer
5	great color
4	used this on an unsightly pimple near my hairline it did n't dry my skin and was easy to use under makeup i 've found that to be true of other salicylic treatments what i liked about this was the precision of the applicator i appreciated that it 's non porous aluminum and can be wiped clean with a tissue or cotton ball when i'm done
5	best facial cleanser i 've ever used i have extremely oily skin and have noticed a significant difference with oiliness throughout the day it does n't over dry either a little goes a long way !
4	for my type of hair , the hold was not very strong however , it did say you could use it as a base for your other styling products still , at that price point , it 's an expensive product having said all that , i did like it if your hair is not as curly as mine , you 'll probably like it more it did n't really hold the curls , but i wet my hands with water and lightly touched the ends of my hair , which made them curl up nicely it also made my hair feel quite soft , not hard as occurs with other styling products the scent is a light scent , and the product feels light in your hands this product is best for people who have moderately curly or wavy hair
5	this is the only lotion i use it is super lightweight but effective the scent is subtle and smells so good i buy this lotion for gifts as well
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i'm blessed with the combination of aging skin and acne , so i 've become pretty fussy about my toners i stay away from most of the regular drugstore selections , because they dry out my skin and some of them cause flaking and irritation my go to choices have been some of the line i'm very happy to report that this effaclar clarifying solution has found a place in my regular routine i 've been using this regularly for a couple weeks now i felt i had to give it a good trial to make sure it was n't going to irritate my skin or cause breakouts it has n't done either in fact it 's helped to clear my skin , which was in the of breaking out when i started using the i actually use it to remove my \( light \) makeup at the end of the day after a couple cotton pads of this stuff , my skin is clean and toned , and treated with salicylic acid \( and some glycolic acid as well , a skin renewing treatment i have used in my treatments with excellent success \) i ca n't conclude this review without mentioning one more thing i liked about this toner the packaging the look is very clean and medicinal , as you would expect from a high end , unscented acne aging treatment it 's all business , no around and i love the dispenser top it 's such a small thing , but so many cosmetics have and or annoying dispensers this is a simple flip top that dispenses in easy to control quantities , a drop at a time \( unless you squeeze firmly \) that 's a helpful thing with a toner like this , which is both powerful and costly you do n't want to out huge , wasteful quantities overall , this is a very well thought out toner that 's far higher quality than most of what you 'll find on a typical drugstore shelf highly recommended as a brightener and anti breakout treatment for folks like me , who are still suffering from acne even as our skin begins to show its age
2	this product did nothing to control my frizz i live in florida where the humidity is off the and this product was an epic fail for me yes , it does n't contain silicone , and that 's great for those who are silicone sensitive however , silicone is the only that works for me when the humidity to 90 this balm does smell wonderful and goes on smoothly , and it did make my dry , frizz prone hair smooth but once i stepped outside my air conditioned house , all hell broke loose within an hour , the frizz was back with a and i was right back where i started , as if i had not applied any product or made any effort at styling my hair at all so i ca n't exactly understand the good reviews for this product i purchased it at ulta , so i know it is authentic i also purchased phyto 7 leave in conditioner , which is nice however , this product is promptly going back to the store years ago , this was a cult favorite , but that was before silicone serums started appearing on the market as far as the florida humidity goes , only silicone is strong enough to eliminate florida frizz i recommend a few products that have worked well for me for drugstore , got2b shine serum is pure silicone and works as well as much more expensive serums moroccan oil treatment and macadamia professional serum are both good options apply these to clean damp hair i use about a nickel size dollop for my below shoulder length hair be careful not to apply these products to the roots i apply them to the and ends and then , without adding any more product , i smooth what 's left on my hands over the top layer of my hair , avoiding the part also good , is bumble and bumble invisible oil primer , which hydrates , provides thermal protection \( as do the serums \) , adds shine and eliminates frizz completely it 's a 10 miracle leave in is also good spray these on clean damp hair before styling products these products are holy grail products for me and work much better than phyto but if you 're on a no silicone kick , by all means give this product a try however , if the humidity where you live is high , you 'd be better off with one of the serums or sprays i 've mentioned i definitely do n't recommend this product
5	good
5	this is my new favorite for styling my short hair the flat iron is a bit to maneuver for me , and since i have to get very close to my scalp \( i have a short , maybe 3 4 inches long \) , it is tricky to get the comb in to ensure the strands are n't in a mess when i get the iron on them , but i do n't have much wiggle room for both the comb and the iron meanwhile , a hair dryer can only do so much for frizzy curly bits enter this little gadget ! there are several heat settings , which is great , since thickness , texture , and desired style all affect how much you need the grip is comfortable , and it is easy to use i did burn myself a bit by touching the outside edges of the comb part a couple of times , but my face and head never got burned , so all in all , it was a win in that department i was trying to straighten some spots , and it did pretty well not quite as effective as the iron or blow dryer , but less of a hassle at the end of the day , i'm low maintenance , so i got what i wanted
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	the jack black conditioner is wonderful my hair is so dry that i after i shampoo and rinse , it feels like straw in my hands the jack black was working as i was running my fingers through my hair , i could feel my hair soften and the texture become smoother right in the shower i like that this is also a scalp conditioner with the tea tree oil a lot of conditioners tell you to only put it on the ends of your hair , because it will weigh down around the scalp the jack black is light and rinses out easily afterwards my hair was shiny and smooth , even the ends which desperately need a trim
4	if you are old enough to remember polo by ralph lauren from the 90s well , this smells a lot like that it smells masculine lemony it reminds me of loud parties , intense physical chemistry , daring if you want in a cologne , move on if you want an on the floor experience , this just might be the cologne for you
5	all mario products are great , but this was a nice little luxury to add on top
4	my wife likes this glaze to extend her hair color she said it 's a little like conditioner which makes the hair feel more and heavy and she is careful about over using this as a regular shampoo she switches between her normal shampoo and use this once a week to have that in the hair
5	nice top coat for a smooth shiny finish seems to last well i got it a little on amazon then at the department store
5	love the color
4	it is tricky to get hair to behave and still be soft , but this pomade pulls it off well it goes on like a thick gel , and is shiny or matte if you apply it when your hair is wet or dry , respectively i have found that using a little gives my hair some motion and sheen , while applying more \( but still not much \) allows me to go full and clean cut it works very well and surprisingly does not make my hair feel crunchy my only critique is that as the magic wears off over the day and the hair is out of place , it leaves the texture looking on the greasy and clumpy side however , it is easy to wash out with warm water and start over if needed
5	i knew ahava was a good brand , but i really did n't appreciate it until an lost my luggage and i needed to buy some toiletries that they were willing to pay for i bought a kit that included this and was really impressed it makes my hand feel really smooth and does n't wear off right away like cheaper brands i just bought a bunch more on my own dime , and as someone who travels frequently and normally just uses hotel provided lotions , that says a lot definitely worth the price and highly recommended now i just have to keep the rest of the family thinking the cheap stuff is good so they do n't take my ahava
5	1 in skincare
3	it 's a nice product , but a little to light for me polish stays on well
4	i have coarse , frizzy hair and have similar products for years all the products that i liked the best have had similar ingredients and create that same silky feel to my hair that the obliphica professional seaberry shine mist has i like that the mist comes in a spray bottle , i can spray it directly to my hair or spray it in my hair and rub it in my hair with my hands it also adds shine which is beautiful it is n't a product that you would want to use if you have oily hair but dry and coarse hair like mine just soaks it up the scent is the same that ive had in other obliphica products which is a nice , warm , spicy scent i really like the product but i have had very similar products at a much cheaper price point
4	i have sensitive skin and usually break out in a rash in my cheek area to the sides of my nose under eye area whenever i try a new cream with the vichy cream , i did not ! that was rather amazing i would n't really call this a cream , it has a different texture more of a cream gel mix kind of the consistency of an instant pudding before it thickens ! you do not need a lot of cream , and it is not real heavy on your skin , it seems to absorb well rather confusing is that it 's called a night cream , yet the instructions say to use at night and morning if you do use it in the morning , there is no sunscreen in the product i have seen results , my skin seems more smooth , and softer i took away a star for the scent , it is rather strong , a sweet floral scent , and i 'd rather use unscented products on my face other than that , i really like the product , hopefully they 'll offer an unscented version for future purchases
5	this lip sunscreen goes on nice and smooth with lots of moisture although the lip protection is tinted , i did n't have any problems with color staining skin or clothing the tint goes on very and my boyfriend was able to use it as well without worrying he looked like he had lip gloss on i like that it has a higher spf than most lip sunscreens \( 45 vs 15 or 30 \) because it 's so smooth creamy , you do feel like it might wear off quicker than the 80 minutes it says before reapplying , but i spent the entire afternoon in the sun with a single application and did n't feel like i was close to getting burned on my lips what 's best is that there is no bad smell or taste to the lip protection you do n't feel like you 're eating sunscreen !
5	i 've waited a bit to write this review i 've got a good size bald thinning spot on the crown of my head a couple of months ago i decided to try toppik after my barber recommended it it has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right i 've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is i never told anyone what i was doing people kept asking me if i had just gotten a haircut they knew something had , but could n't figure out what it was yesterday i was out for a walk my partner of 30 years and a friend while i was walking in front of them my partner said what did you do to your hair \? i cringed i thought that he had noticed that i had put something on it and it showed i him what he meant he said that my bald spot was gone he then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair he could not tell what i had done , but my bald spot was gone my friend touched it and said that it was soft if i could fool them i could fool anyone even looking for it they could n't tell like i said , it took a bit to get the application down just right this should not discourage you , you just need a little practice i wash my hair , blow dry it and apply the toppik , using a hand mirror to see the back i use the toppik until i get good coverage , brush it and then use a light spray of hairspray it kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place , but it is not stiff most days this is just a minute or so you do n't need to if you just let your hair dry naturally , but do n't use the toppik on wet hair i think that it would clump also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps give it a try !
5	the best handcream in the world as a nurse , washing my hands 100 timed a day , it has saved my hands the scent is soft and lovely , and softens dry , cracked skin
4	la roche posay is one of the few skin care lines that never irritates my sensitive skin , or cause it to break out it is pricey , but worth it i had never before tried their makeup line , so i was curious to see how it worked pros no scent non irritating feels good on the skin no breakouts went on smoothly cons a little drying in non oily areas like my cheeks caked and flaked a bit a couple of hours after application conclusion i think this product might work well for those with sensitive skin , but it definitely needs to be applied over a moisturizer
5	aaa
3	my hair is fine and my scalp is dry which regular deep conditioning i liked the aroma of this conditioner and how silky my hair was after using it although it is for coarser hair than mine , it did n't weigh down my hair the negatives are that it did n't impart much shininess to my hair i also find that it is much more expensive than other brands of conditioners that provide a better finish to my hair
5	makes my nail polish last a lot longer , nothing more to say about it
4	scent is a personal preference i really like the burberry body tender scent and have been complimented on it it 's described as being the youthful twist on the burberry body line it still smells grown up , but not too musky this lotion is not meant to moisturize your skin it is can be worn on it 's own so you just get a light scent you can wear it with the body tender perfume on top to make the scent last longer or you can use it as a base for layering a different body perfume on top for your own scent the body tender milk is very light and goes on smoothly it pumps out only a small amount at a time which allows you to control how much you put on a little at a time it comes in the same bottle design as all the other body products if you already love the body tender perfume , i would recommend the body tender milk it is great to wear on it 's own or for layering scents
5	this is a great product it goes on smoothly and blends well i use this to hide skin discoloration from old bites on my legs it lasts well in humid weather and does n't run or cake it has no aroma or causes irritation
5	i love the aroma and how gently it glides and slides on my skin this is a good product that as other u s reviewers have noted , does work well with related products in addition to of natural products , it makes my skin feel good
4	good quality brush , super soft , and blends well the knock from 5 to 4 stars is the lack of a protective cover for the bristles , or a mechanism which would the bristles into the handle even a slip cover or sleeve would improve the life of this brush
5	if i can give it 10 stars , i would i 've never had a shampoo conditioner so good the moment that thing hits your hair and scalp , you can feel it 's 100 natural ingredients and not artificial the texture , the aroma , the way it cleans , is simply phenomenal the pump came with a seal cap preventing leak during shipping the pump does n't over pump and it generally takes me 2 pumps to get the amount i need this is also sold in nordstrom at a higher price i love this after use , the scalp feels really clean and not heavy the hair is moisturized but not oily or tangled rich aroma with many of the scents you can smell natural coconut , kelp , etc but no strong artificial scent like candy or berry or citrus scents it 's not overpowering and not irritating to scalp or skin it 's very gentle to hair i am not sure about how well it keeps colors if you have color treatment but i am definitely switching to jack black from generic brands from now on
5	my stylist just did my hair with it and i look amazing , now i just have to learn to do it
5	i was n't sure about this color but the minute i tried it on i was in love ! the color has a bit of shimmer and its more of a pinkish coral color
2	i 've been on the hunt for a good eye makeup remove for a while so far all of the brands that have been recommended to me either are n't very good at all \( clinique \) or contain aloe \( neutrogena \) some of the products i 've wanted to try \( like l'oreal \) had scary reviews i had hoped that this product from vichy would be different the amazon product page gives the description of the product as a highly effective , yet gentle eye make up remover to hydrates , soothe and help reduce the appearance of fatigue the product is supposed to effectively remove eye makeup while soothing the under eye area i will say that the product is rather soothing it does n't irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes , nor has it caused any irritation or dryness or anything like that it also does n't sting if it gets into my eyes during use however , it does n't do much toward removing my eye makeup , either no matter how careful i am , no matter how much i put on the cotton pad nor how much time i take the eye area , i still have product come off onto my towel when i dry my face i cleanse my face again before bed every night , and yet i still wake up with black smudges under my eyes every morning i confess , i do wear a lot of eye makeup every day , i wear shadow , liner , and mascara before i ever swab with eye makeup remove , i use cold cream and a warm washcloth to remove most of the makeup it does n't get it all obviously \( i wear contacts and you do n't want to risk getting cold cream in your eye , and you also do n't want to scrub too much in that area \) but it gets a lot the fact that this product ca n't remove what 's left is a big disappointment perhaps it would work better for someone who wears less makeup but i can say i wo n't be spending 17 00 for another bottle
5	works beautifully no white residue
5	wonderful product
4	overall this is a nice , creamy moisturizer it does a good job of locking in moisture and is light on the skin there 's a light floral scent that i do n't care for as i prefer no scent in moisturizers , but that is a personal preference there is an ever so slight plumpness that this product gives to the skin which visually is nice and youthful , and it seems to last a few hours i do n't know if the anti fatigue part really does as much as you 'd think , but i will say that my under eyes seem a bit less puffy these days but about as dark as usual i have olive skin that is pretty thick , so this product might be better for lighter , thinner skin people
4	i am a new lover of this brand , it 's way too light for me , but the other items i did try i loved
4	this is a nice tanner but is definitely dark you 'll want the associated mitt , as it will stain palms and not come off it was a little too dark for my pale skin , even after using the lighter version of this lotion
5	i have used this product for at least a decade it 's comparable to more expensive brands on the market brand is
4	the good it works i 've only been using this for a week and i 've already noticed a significant difference with the skin on my neck now , i'm only just starting to show the signs of aging skin , so your mileage may vary , but the crepe texture i get when i stretch my neck is all but gone it 's pleasant to use i like how light and gentle both creams are the exfoliating body polish uses beads versus harsher sand like crystals in other exfoliants i 've tried the intensive body repair cream is also less invasive than other products that promise skin rejuvenation the bad i find the duo somewhat sized i'm through the exfoliating body polish and barely putting a dent in the body repair cream expensive while this product is working for me , it is definitely expensive to try and its 3oz version is n't priced either
4	from my daughter nice makeup for a reasonable price the color was n't a match , but i still tried out the powder on my face and it went on nice and smooth and had a good amount of coverage i also like that there is n't any fragrance and it did n't irritate my skin at all
5	first , it 's embedded in really sturdy glass , so even if this over the table on which i 've set it i'm not afraid if it shattering we keep it in our living room and light it when people come over the smell is n't strong and wafts down the into the room and kitchen we live in a single level apartment , but it 's a very wide , so i was surprised to find the smell all the way in the opposite side of the house but the living room \( again , where this candle is \) does n't have such a strong smell as to be on the senses yes , the smell is obviously stronger , but not unpleasant in the way some candles can be it 's a warm woodsy smell , and everyone who has come in has commented on how nice it smells we used to use , but they can get quite expensive if you do n't find them on , and they would often leave a very strong smell in the beginning then suddenly fade away , even if there was half of the liquid still in the cartridge candles are a better alternative , though may not be as strong as something like which is completely fine for me it may seem a bit expensive , but when you stack up the prices for electric replacements , the candles are certainly a better deal in the long run
5	i already owned a black hair dryer for over a decade never had a problem with it a friend of mine needed a hair dryer and i gave her a non one i had in my guest bathroom then i saw that this was offered on amazon and ordered it in white it 's identical to the one from , which is now in my guest bathroom for all my guests to use the newer model has a tad more power and is both attractive , easy to use , not loaded with unnecessary features it is as exactly described and dries my very thick long hair to perfection very quickly there is a cold switch if you need to have your temperature a little lower , medium as well as high for heat also three variables for speed it 's made in italy what more can i say \? this is the best hair dryer you can spend your money on and a worthy investment enjoy !
5	really works helps getting polish off easier
5	this is a wonderful product if does as it promises refines your pores for less clogging , keeping your skin in cleaner and simply prettier condition i experienced no sensitivity issues the product goes on nicely , causing no redness or irritation and the scent is mild this has become a go to for me will very happily continue to use
5	light and creamy
3	tried the moisturizer this morning was disappointed that you are supposed to keep away from the eyes and that 's what gets super dry on my face still looking for the ultimate eye cream this one is also not supposed to be used on breakouts so we 'll see if the other products resolve the skin issues and then we 'll let the teens try the moisturizer
3	there are so many face lotions out there , and so many of them flow on smoothly , moisturize , and bring brightness and tone to my face why , then , what i want to wear one that smells like hawaiian tropic sun lotion \? this has a very powerful coconut sunscreen scent to it i do like that scent , but it 's not necessarily what i would consider sophisticated if you really like the scent of sunscreen , this might be the ideal face lotion for you it has a great medium consistency that flows on smoothly without sticking , and does n't leave your face looking greasy i am confident that it is moisturizing as advertised if you prefer a more elegant or subtle scent to your face lotions , i would keep looking i get sent a whole lot of face lotions to review , and this one does not stand out
3	i love jane iredale products and the concept here is interesting with the concealer and highlighting colors it matched well with my skin tone \( medium fair with cool to neutral undertones \) and was easy to apply correctly after watching an online tutorial however , unfortunately , this product is extremely drying it settles in fine lines and kind of sits on top of the skin instead of blending into it , which creates the opposite of a youthful effect i always have to apply moisturizer on top of it to get it to disappear into the skin \( even though i have also moisturized before applying any makeup ! \) i was excited to find a mineral concealer that looked so promising but i am now going to continue looking for a more moisture rich product
5	great serum for skin , not only it fights with zits , but also works for better appearance overall it burns a bit because has a menthol in it , but i spray my face with spring water and use less serum work great under sunscreen and make up
5	it is light , very gentle and effective in removing makeup without leaving any kind of residue that could irritate my skin i can skip putting moisturizer on after using it because my skin does not feel dry after it it has very non smell my skin is very sensitive and tends to react to a lot of products , but not to this one
4	updated review i have used this product multiple times since receiving my uv lamp the color indicated on the bottle is very close to the color within it i was not shocked there was a slight difference there is a learning curve when switching from regular nail polish to the gel color system the objective of the gel color system is to make each layer as thin as possible if you fail to do that , you will notice wrinkling and when you begin to cure the color another trick that you will want to use is to get as close the the cuticle as possible without letting the product actually touch the cuticle it takes some time to perfect it , but after a couple of tries you will get the hang of it i watched a lot of youtube video on the best ways to go about it the color looks great and will go perfectly with even the most professional work environment i am now a believer and of the gel color system the color truly last for 14 days , i can even where the color longer if my nails did n't grow so fast i consider myself an educated consumer , and thoroughly researched each system before i purchased anything this is definitely a great buy ! ! ! you ca n't go wrong i'm looking forward to my next purchase i just received my cnd shellac gel color today i ordered it sat and received on wed not bad for free shipping i'm still waiting for uv lamp and my cnd shellac base and top coat to come in once they do , i will update my review it came in its original packaging , and i ca n't wait to use it ! ! ! !
5	my dad used to travel to france for business when i was little and we would have new alligator every time ! i was very pleased to see the new cloth alligator on this beautiful bottle of perfume the top is sturdy and the spray very misty and the smell is wonderful i am very pleased
4	this body cream has a pleasant , earthy scent it might be ideal for someone who enjoys the fragrance of essential oils it 's not overly floral or feminine in fragrance and would be a nice option for both men and women the cream absorbs in nicely without leaving a greasy residue the smell reminds me a little bit of the spa the packaging is attractive as well
2	other reviewers commented that this product was very thick and they did not mean that in a good way i'm not sure i 'd call it very thick it seemed more sticky than thick to me very hard to massage into the skin seemed almost as if the components were not well mixed i did not like it i might try to add some water and or other moisturizer and see if that improves the situation , rather than throw the tube away , but i do n't think i 'd recommend it to others
5	i love opi polish never have complaints there this polish has more of a mauve tone to it
4	this color took nearly three weeks to be delivered the color is hot orange and neon but it dries in matte finish not gloss i wish it was glossy because the matte finish always looks cheap it 's hard to find a neon nail polish that looks glossy and high def
4	i was when they stopped making the extreme 50 because it literally kept my oily , acne prone skin clear and reduced the size of my pores i tried this on a whim and really like it so far i'm assuming the secret ingredient here is the because it was in extreme too it does n't make my skin look as as perfect but it 's still a really nice daily moisturizer that makes my skin look better wish it had more spf , however update way too greasy for summer wear , especially under foundation i 'll save for colder weather
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	love it came fast to will buy more
2	polish chips very easily love the color
3	just did my nails two days ago and i now have a big chip in the middle of my index finger this polish is n't very durable at all it 's not even as sturdy as essie polishes this is a beautiful sea green color that i thought would be perfect for spring summer it goes on a little dark , but is still pretty it 's too bad it does n't stand up to even the slightest wear it went on a little streaky , but once the second coat was on , it was fine this is the first zoya polish i 've tried before now , i have n't been impressed by the color selection , but this nice green color spoke to me when i was in ulta \( and there was a sale to boot , lol ! \) i do n't like having chips and usually do my polish as soon as they start to appear but i definitely do n't like it when i 've my manicure and a huge appears in the middle of my nail ! not cool at all i have n't used one of the 5 free formulas before and so far , i do n't like it at all give me the chemicals that make nail polish last a week please ! i guess i 'll go repair my chipped nail now , and hopefully that 'll be it for a while i recommend this polish only if you 're sensitive to the chemicals in nail polish otherwise , try whim , butter london , dior or even essie all of which last longer than this zoya polish
4	pretty color
5	i love this color the cnd shellac technology is great and yes , you must this type of nail color polish with a uv light but it is totally worth the added cost and effort it does not chip and it stays shiny \( with the required top coat \) it takes about 5 minutes to remove and does not damage the nail this color is a very dark brown with a hint of maroon i use it on my fingernails and it enough with essie 's wicked color it is a fab color for the winter months i think it may be a bit too much for summer and spring
5	i got this to go with my dermablend intense powder camo makeup in natural , and the light shade was about one click darker than i usually go but works well for me in the summer i use it under my eyes , and it 's so hard to find a product with spf for eye area usage and this being in the dermablend line made it was hard to contain myself from buying it before i settled on a shade i went to a local store that had open , then i left to buy it online for the better price i figured out what shades will work well for me in the summer vs the winter so i was happy to have used the it is very creamy , so much so that i may have to change to a more waterproof eyeliner because it makes it run a bit also i was used to needing to use more product , i can use less with this , really just a few dots here and there an and then blend it in for me it does have enough pigment to use it like that i'm very happy with this product and fully intend to keep on using it i would also recommend it to anyone
5	this is unique nail polish because it actually lets your fingernails breathe ! wo knew that nails need to breathe \? well , if you wear polish , you 'll notice the difference right away it just feels lighter
5	i find the deep pore and radiance brushes are the ones i actually use but i like all four brushes the key for me is to not press hard on my face these brush heads certainly exfoliate the skin although i personally do n't think they make acne scars go away , could be wrong about that though one of the biggest to learn about using the clarisonic is to replace the brush heads on time instructions say once every three months , i'm sure there are reasons why the timing may vary but it 's important to at least take them off to clean the device before it gets moldy the brushes are good and necessary if one uses the device often
4	i never thought of using juice as a blemish treatment but juice beauty blemish clearing serum changed my mind i had planned to use this strictly on my face when i got blemishes that plan changed when i had breakout blemishes on my upper chest area that showed when wearing a dress or shirt that was open at the neck revealing ! i then used juice beauty for about ten days and this blemish breakout was gone i very much like the dropper that allows dispensing of the product without mess i also like the clean light fragrance of the product nothing perfumey or loud easy to uses with placing on hands and lather up and massage into the area i would recommend this to women who have routine blemish breakouts especially with hormonal changes i do think you will be pleased this product came from amazon
5	this is a great product i have used it in place of my standard moisturizer and it more than does the job it is a clear gel with bits of green apple in it it has a pleasant fruity scent it is a nice , light texture and absorbs quickly i have been using this for 2 weeks and my skin has been clearer and smoother than normal and my pores seem to have shrunk i will definitely purchase again !
5	i have used this herbal toner for three weeks so far and it works great my skin feels rejuvenated and looks good
3	this body cream is thick and rich and scent free , so it wo n't clash with fragrance all plusses given its price it 's practically on par with solid gold i have strictly limited its use to most spots neck , chest , back of arms , knees it hydrates my skin well , but i cannot honestly say it the effects of aging had i not received this product through the amazon vine program , i would n't have been willing to spent this amount of money on an intensive body repair treatment also , talk about unfortunate branding who wants to have a product around that the word crepe \? it 's a
3	i found this sunscreen cover creme to be a little too thick for my taste i could n't get the of applying it perfectly you need very little for coverage also , it is recommended that you reapply it every few hours when out in the sun it may be that i should have chosen a somewhat darker shade to match my skin color , which is not as pale in the summertime summer is , of course , the ideal time of year to use this product , as it is thick and , as mentioned , contains sunscreen if you have blemishes , redness , or , this creme may be ideal for your face the coverage is even and complete just be sure to go with the exact shade you want for your face i have found that the creme is nice to have for less noticeable areas of my body after a mild sunburn the creme helps protect the area from further sun damage
5	this is a light grey goes on opaque with 2 coats tip wear is n't as as with darker colors product needs a uv lamp to cure
4	ever since proactiv , every facewash comes in a 1 2 3 kit these days the three products usually wash , toner and moisturizer are supposed to combine to fight off acne and make your skin glow in this case , i would say the baxter 1 2 3 kit is more of a bundle of various skin products which have been around forever , but do work for example the face wash a slightly cetaphil the toner a slightly gentler sea breeze the moisturizer also very similar to the cetaphil moisturizer the good news is that , even if these baxter brand items were by similar items already on the market , it does seem like they have been able to improve them as it turns out , i 've always for a gentle cetaphil cleanser that was slightly and here it is ! i enjoy sea breeze , but it 's too strong for my sensitive skin ! a slightly gentler sea breeze the moisturizer is pretty generic , but i'm happy that it is fragrance free , oil free , and does n't make my face look like a sticky mess it 's a little strange that this 1 2 3 kit does n't have a fragrance free toner , since the wash and moisturizer are fragrance free , but that 's okay i guess overall while this baxter line of skin care products does n't offer anything revolutionary , i really like the facial cleanser because it is fragrance free , very gentle , leaves the skin feeling moist , but does a more thorough clean than the comparable cetaphil brand the toner makes my face shiny , so i 've avoided using it regularly , but it has a fun minty feel to it that is fine as long as your skin is n't sensitive to it the moisturizer is good enough , i use small doses of it the price may seem fairly high , but if you compare it to cetaphil again , it 's about the same price for a cleanser and moisturizer i give it an above average recommendation !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	if you have hormonal acne which is stubborn buy this ! ! ! any kind of acne , really i 've not seen a product like this nor have i seen this fast of a result
5	i have been wearing this shade for years it 's terrific !
5	i initially bought the 2 version , but as soon as i took a look at it i knew it was too big , so i sent it back for the 1 1 2 and the size is perfect for getting nice big , soft mermaid waves i love that it gets really hot , really fast i 've had problems in the past with other curling and flat irons not getting really hot or only for a couple weeks of use , but that 's not the case here this gets my thick coarse hair smooth and shiny as silk , and never sticks or i would definitely buy it again
3	the dermablend natural beige is a great color match on my fair complexion i love the moisturizing feel on my face while adding spf 30 protection im very disappointed the high color coverage foundation did not work for me i followed the color cream application instructions with a primer and setting powder after a few hours it clings to dry areas and appears caked and on my face fine lines became visible i have a few lines in my eye area , but nothing like this ! ive never met a person who wanted to accent facial fine lines it also made my pores appear larger than life by appearing more like white heads i'm glad this cover cream works for so many other people and wished it worked for me too
1	not authentic ! does not work like the real ones ! piece of junk
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	i did n't know that henckels made grooming products we have their five inch kitchen knife that is my wife 's favorite and we have had it for more than five years so , i was expecting the same quality this came in a nice box with an outer sleeve the steel set itself is nicely contained in a leather pouch design wise , the set does not disappoint , it is sleek and smooth , specially the nail clipper , that keeps flat it 's compact size and nice leather case makes it great for travel functionally , the nail clipper is weak i was scared i would almost break it upon using it on my thumbnail i had to just clip a very little at a time for it to bite and clip easily i did not proceed with the rest of my fingernails , it just took too long the file worked well , my loved the size and it was easy to hold the tweezers were good as well , it held hair as i pulled instead of breaking it each piece is has a good weight to it and is beautifully finished my wife could use this set better than i can but i can see having this as a quick kit to take with you daily , when you are out on the go when you need to clip a fingernail quickly , hair that you missed , etc overall , still a quality set , but not for my man
5	i loooove essie polishes they wear great , do n't chip , and have dozens and dozens of colors you ca n't find anywhere else this color is vibrant and has the tiniest and i mean tiny amount of sparkle to it it is a great go to color for when you ca n't decide at the salon for all ages ! \) i highly recommend this one , ladies \)
4	this shampoo is green , thick and pearl like it smells great while in the shower and lathers nicely \( although the smell is gone after rinsing \) the smell gives the impression of wholesome , earthy products \( aloe and eucalyptus \) but the ingredients make clear it is not organic not a big deal because most are n't , but just do n't be fooled by the smell \( or name \) i tend to have hair on the oily side by the end of the day it has an oily this shampoo seems to help that , and also gives my hair a soft and shiny appearance i did n't use the same brand conditioner and i am not sure if that makes a difference i used garnier conditioner in sum , i do like this product better than my normal shampoo \( garnier \) however , i will need to think about whether i will buy it because 20 for a bottle of shampoo seems expensive i deducted one star because of this factor
5	i love the smell of this product and a little goes a long way if you use to much , your hair looks greasy i use some before i blow dry and a little after i iron my hair
5	i ca n't recall when i first found this color , but i 'll keep ordering it online since essie has discontinued it it 's the best summer time pedi color
4	i almost hate to say it , but i really like this stuff it has no fragrance that i can notice , so if you 're hoping to spring breeze or powder fresh or berry delight , you will need to seek a different product i live where it gets hot in the spring and very hot in the summer i even sweat and stink in the fall and winter i'm not generally super active , but i do many children around every day i 've noticed that i do n't smell bad , and i do n't sweat terribly it 's not perfect , but at the end of the day i am not offensive at all the product comes as a white cream in a squeeze tube that can be applied directly to your underarms it also does n't take a whole lot of product it does seem to take a while to dry completely under your arms , and it can transfer while still wet i have n't noticed white spots after it dries
5	does a fantastic job at lining the inner rim to make eyes seem bigger and more awake lasts long considering the inner rim is always prone to fade
3	3 5 stars i used it on my 2nd pregnancy hoping to reduce the effects of stretch marks it helps with the itching on my skin as it , however , i do n't think it had much effect on the stretch marks at all i found the scent to be too strong for me i was really sensitive to scents earlier on in my pregnancy and this lotion used to make me nauseous it got better as i became less sensitive to the smell in the third i would have preferred all pregnancy products to be unscented also had a problem with the tube design the cap always caused the lotion when opened
5	blending is as important to makeup application as it is to cooking and baking this kabuki brush is superb the domed bristles are silky soft and smooth and the handle provides adequate grip the handle is short which enhances precision in application it is superb at applying mineral or liquid foundation , shimmer and bronzer as well as blending blush and powders it is lightweight and easy to transport there are no directions as to cleaning i know this brand has its own brush cleaner nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href japonesque waterless brush cleanser 0 15 lb dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 japonesque waterless brush cleanser , 0 15 lb a nbsp but washing in a mixture of water and gentle shampoo , rinsing and air drying is equally effective i do like this brush and it has quickly become a makeup bag essential
5	i use a face moisturizer every day , mostly because of dry skin , and the fact that i live in south florida where the sun is a constant companion this moisturizer lived up to my expectations and then some while many moisturizers are greasy , or leave a residue on your hands this one was absorbed into my skin quickly with almost no residue whatsoever the other aspect of this product that i really liked was that it was not scented , and did n't leave a strange smell on my face after use \( especially when combined with cologne this can be a problem \) i used the product primarily during the day , and not at night as recommended \( when i normally apply moisturizer \) but i found that the product kept my skin soft all day i'm not sure that it would erase wrinkles \( can anything do that \? \) but i certainly found it superior to my normal face moisturizer i think you will be very pleased with this product
5	this is a perfect color for spring ! you need at least 2 coats if not 3 to bring it up to it 's richest color very eye catching , fun color
5	no stinging or flaking with this superior eye treatment the odorless white cream goes on smoothly makeup is easy to apply over it after a few minutes
3	i like the nice feel of this pillowcase but have not noticed a difference in my fine lines i am in my late 30 's and have fine lines around my eyes after using this pillowcase exclusively for a month i have not noticed any difference in my skin i do not use any other type of wrinkle products so maybe if i layered products and used this pillow with something else it might work but does not seem to do anything on its own
5	love this stuff what a difference ! and i got it pretty quickly
5	every time i order this product it perfect fast delivery will continue to order
5	i love nail polish \( what girl does n't \) and this pretty , girly color stays on fabulously i 'll definitely be ordering more in other colors
4	went to get my nails done and chose this color i love it so many people have asked me about who made it i would have given it a 5 star rating but sometimes , you 'll need 3 coats instead of 2 to get the true color
1	i guess i should have read the reviews before i ordered , this polish has absolutely no shine ! it looks terrible , hate it ! ! !
4	nice color , applied pretty evenly
5	eternity by calvin klein is a timeless perfume i 've liked it since i was in my late teens and still like it in my mid 30 's as i look back through the reviews , i see some comments about the bottle people received from amazon not being genuine or not being high quality the bottle i received is perfect , looks right , smells right , feels right the same as i 'd at my local department store so either amazon must have had a bad batch , or people purchased from a third party seller counterfeit i only love this bottle and will be ordering more when this one runs out i recommend that you ensure that you are purchasing directly from amazon to avoid the risk of product , like some of the previous reviewers seemed to experience also , at the time of this review the product is less expensive at 's , so you may want to compare the pricing at local stores
3	i got this product for my wife and her review is as follows i'm in my early thirties , but my two kids are sucking the pretty out of me , so i thought i would try adding some kind of anti aging product to my skin care regime i have been using this serum daily , sometimes twice daily , for the last couple of weeks it feels just like a moisturizer or something going on , but perhaps lighter at such a high price , i ca n't imagine putting this all over your neck and everyday but i guess if you have wrinkles there , it might be worth it i can feel it doing something to my skin after i apply it just a slight warmth on my skin that goes away quickly i follow this serum with some moisturizer of a different brand i ca n't say that i'm noticing any results as of yet and at 75 an ounce i was hoping for more my skin might look a little more luminous and maybe it feels a little better , but i still look like i need a nap most of the time \( which i do \) maybe some of the little wrinkles are looking less deep i 'll continue using it as perhaps the improvements are yet to come and if that happens i will update my review accordingly i definitely like the idea of organic and natural ingredients in a product like this , so i think this is certainly a better choice than a chemical facial cream and it is mostly likely just as effective as a less natural product i am skeptical of the anti aging products , so i 'll be pleasantly surprised if it actually does something good for my skin so far , it sure is n't doing any harm , but i'm not looking much more luminous or young
5	excellent product i love every product ive used from this brand
5	love the color !
5	i really like this mascara , it does n't seem to make my lashes brittle and break , its different , natural type product , but really gives you the lashes ! its a bit tricky to build on tho , seems like you just make sure you got the section done well , before you move on , reapplying , makes them , stick together a little i think its like that tubes type mascara in application
5	i was n't aware of how dirty my makeup brushes really were until i used this product i laid my brush on a paper towel , applied the remover and gently began wiping away the makeup it took several times to get 1 brush clean , but what a difference ! dried quickly and the scent was barely noticeable a tad pricey , but works well
4	product feels nice on skin and has a nice lemony scent hard to tell if it really tightened as much as it claims , but skin does look moisturized didnt experience any negative side effects
5	i love essie because of it 's staying power it lasts for more than one week and this color was rockin' i received many compliments on the color
5	it 's true , i do look younger ! \( insert happy face here \) my wrinkles look plumped up and less noticeable and the deep lines that my mouth are almost gone for someone over 55 , that 's pretty awesome i will definitely buy this again
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	truly have never met a la roche posay product that did n't work as stated i have acne , oily skin and this works great i see the improvement in my skin after using it for just a week !
4	at first i was reluctant to use retinol , but i have discovered over the years , that retinol is a product that is helpful to the skin you cannot just choose any brand , please look for a brand with a good reputation and excellent reviews my skin is used to retinol so i do not need to watch , but if i change brands , i apply the retinol carefully and watch for any changes my skin feels soft and pliable , and this is an excellent brand recommended prisrob 05 05 18
5	i am 51 years old and have never found a cleaner that i love well i think i finally did ! i would never have thought that cleansing with oil would be so awesome even though there is no lather whatsoever , you can visibly see this cleanser lifting impurities from your skin i place a small amount of the cleanser on my index and middle fingers and gently rub into my skin in a circular motion i then dampen a cotton round and remove the cleaner and the impurities it has removed from my skin the cleanser leaves a slight oily residue which is quickly absorbed into my skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth the cleanser is not drying , yet does not feel greasy it has a very light fragrance which is extremely pleasant i have not had any adverse reactions , and the camellia oil has not caused any blemishes the cleanser is paraben free , soap free , alcohol free , colorant free , and ph balanced at 4 2 ounces , i believe this bottle will last me at least six months at 18 , i believe this is an excellent value based on the quality of the product cosmetics and cleansers are a very personal choice but this one is just about perfect for me !
5	love it ! ! ! ! !
5	love this lotion best ever great smell no burning
5	lots of in wet shaving preferences a certain blade works great for one , but just will not work on another gent 's face same goes for soap and creams keep in mind your mileage may vary i love this soap lathers easily and is very , very slick more slick than proraso green \( which is a glorious product \) making for an easier shave light , pleasant , clean scent this soap really conditions your skin , too your skin feels soft all day the proraso green is great , but sometimes you need a break from the menthol blast barbershop scent i like to finish my shave with a wet alum block , cold water rinse , and a healthy handful of original or bay rum aftershave splash enjoy !
5	love zoya polish ! i use the base and top coat along with 2 coats of polish i can usually go 2 weeks without a chip and it is easy to remove the polish also knowing it is 5 free brings peace of mind !
5	i love this creamy foundation that covers my freckles , age spots and large , ugly pores use just a teeny , tiny amount of water to blend , but do n't apply too heavy as it will look cake like and show every wrinkle it lasts all day but check in the mirror from time to time as it settles in the lines and needs smoothing out overall , i highly recommend !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	vichy idealia skin sleep night recovery is a lightweight lotion with a light , pleasant fragrance that will be a welcome addition to any bedtime skin care regimen one thing i really like about this product is that vichy has cut down on what ends up in the by their packaging the instructions for use are printed on the inside of the box rather than on a leaflet that 's tucked into the box the box comes apart easily so you can read the instructions , but is n't so flimsy that it comes apart in shipping the instructions , when followed , enhance the experience of using the product by you through a light massage of your head and neck the product itself , leaves my skin feeling nice and dewy when i retire and i wake up with soft feeling skin
5	beautiful color !
4	this stuff is a miracle in a jar it 's a bit heavy for my skin every night but it works wonders when i get dry patches or need my skin to look dewy the next day
4	i 've never had a product that claimed to make my hair thicker actually work well , i guess some of them did , but only because they felt yucky and you could n't even run your fingers through your hair if you wanted to because they coated your hair with so much crap i ca n't say this does n't have any residue whatsoever , but it is so minimal that i will absolutely use it again i am a \( google it \) so i was worried that it would leave or build up , but it rinsed right out sometimes a girl just wants to put product in her hair even if she 's not supposed to ! as an added bonus , this brand has way less and than most others out there
1	it 's meant to help make my hair lustrous but i ca n't put this on because it smells so bad ! just yuck !
3	the texture was like no moisturizer i have used before it is a gel , and while slimy is the wrong word , it was then pure aloe vera the scent was fine , just on the strong side and luckily it subsided after 30 minutes or so
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
5	i do n't often use something after i shave since i only shave a few times a week and my face usually does fine without it at first i was using the shave tonic sparingly , spraying on my hands or something else and wiping off , now i just spray directly on , and it 's great maybe not as moisturizing as lotion or something of that nature , but it smells really nice , gives an instant cooling feeling , and my skin feels nice and smooth soft after
5	would buy again like the large iron worth the money \( a good deal \) and came recommended by our stylist we ordered it for a christmas gift thru amazon
3	back in my twenties , i was a loyal dermablend customer because i had quite a few dark blotches from old blemishes in the 1980 's , the formula options were strictly limited to a pot of dense foundation that had the consistency of concealer if i'm not mistaken , they did n't offer either liquid or powder foundations back then while my skin issues are pretty well resolved now that i 've hit middle age , i am starting to see a bit of hyper pigmentation along the jawline so i thought it was time to give dermablend another look they 're now owned by l'oral and have a more comprehensive product line this particular formula reminds me of the bare minerals solid foundation in that it applies like a powder but turns somewhat creamier as it sets the compact comes with a flat sponge applicator that makes it easy to control the intensity of coverage i received the beige shade which was a fairly good match for my fair skin with yellow undertones the coverage is buildable but it takes a bit of practice to achieve the correct application , particularly if , like me , you do n't want to look too made up if you need to hide blemishes or discolorations , this stuff does a superior job however , i felt that even the lightest application gave my skin a slightly shiny , taut appearance that was aging the verdict \? i think this would be an amazing foundation for someone who wants heavy coverage and it would work best on someone with firm , youthful skin for someone my age , sometimes less is more
3	feels and smells like unscented hair conditioner i wonder if some of the negative comments did n't understand that you must rinse it off having said that , i like that it has fewer chemicals and usually in these kinds of products but it still has too many irritants alcohol is the 3rd ingredient , and just a bad idea it dries out the skin obviously do n't be alarmed by sodium lauryl \( \) on the label , it 's different than sodium lauryl sulfate \( which you 've probably heard about , a horrible ingredient that should be avoided \) by contrast , is derived from coconut and palm oils , and is generally considered gentle and safe the hydroxypropyl guar is what gives conditioners the filmy stickiness , but they could have completely ! this ingredient is why you need to rinse 2 or 3 times to get it off , unnecessary and a potential irritant no single product is going to work with every child , skin problems are reaching proportions these days but it seems to help a little bit with our children , who have just minor skin issues \( grass allergies , cradle cap , dry skin \) at this point , though , i still have mixed feelings and whether i would reorder we have found nothing beats straight coconut oil on the skin most soaps strip us of the protective oils on our skin , so we have been using more oils bio oil is great for repairing damage we mix up our own concoction in a spray bottle , and periodically throughout the day spray it on itchy and dry skin a base of aloe juice , with oils added \( palmers coco butter oil , bio oil , a couple drops of lavender \)
5	great summer color
4	this is a great product for erasing the shine on your face if you want to get rid of an oily buildup , definitely this product it 's great to use over a liquid coverup , if you desire katiebabs
4	very creamy and easy to apply makes her skin feel very soft it may be too early to say it has helped with wrinkles but she says she does see a slight difference
5	i used this after i shaved and it felt very good it goes on light , and non greasy it does n't have any scent to me , and felt like i was applying a delicate face wash i do n't have a lot of facial hair , but i occasionally break out when i shave this has n't caused any break outs after using it , and my skin felt smooth where it was applied it only takes a tiny bit to cover a decent amount of area so this bottle should last i liked this product , and would continue using it
3	my daughter has severe acne this product worked on my own random blemishes but is n't the best for more difficult skin issues
4	really pleased with toppik hair building fibers i would prefer to have a thick head of hair but since that is not the case i am very thankful for this product it gives me the confidence to go out and feel comfortable without worrying that people are staring at my thinning hair
4	skincare is one of my i was excited to try strivectinlabs extreme cream since i 'd been happy with the few strivectin products i 'd used in the past at 89 ounce , the extreme cream is among the pricier moisturizers it 's supposed to encourage cell renewal and collagen production to fight the onset of wrinkles i have n't seen this yet , but it 's a rich and non greasy cream it went on easily on my skin and left my face feeling soft , dewy and well hydrated i have very sensitive skin and had no sensitivity with extreme cream
4	i have had much better luck with dermablend 's powder \( s \) than with its foundations what seems to work well as a summer facial protection make up strategy is to first put on a moisturizer with good sunscreen , then put on a primer \( i like l'oreal primers best \) , and then pat a bit of this powder on , removing the excess with a kabuki brush
5	it 's a flat neon magenta beautiful with a glossy top coat excellent price full size bottle
5	this oil transformed my wife 's skin at night , it provided serious moisture and during the day , provided a great pre makeup primer you only need a couple of drops \( dont waste it its a little pricey \) , but your skin will thank you it does have an aroma , but it is lovely fresh , botanical and not overwhelming it states its for mature skin , but i think any skin could benefit from it you will love this !
5	i ordered the dermablend professional cover creme in both toasted brown golden brown both are nice , but the toasted brown is a little lighter works well with my skin tone when i'm tan it goes on well , it 's easy to apply dermablend makes good quality products , this one , like much of their other products , a little goes a long way i have not had any issues with breakouts or irritation from any of their products , so i 'd recommend if you have sensitive skin all of the dermablend products have provided excellent coverage the hardest thing for me has been selecting the right color it 's often hard for me to do in the store , so online looking at the chart is even worse i 'd recommend if you are like me have trouble selecting colors , check your local store first for color you need , then look on amazon their prices are often better then that way you do n't have to worry about choosing a color that is n't perfect for you \)
5	i drooled over this color when it arrived ! i bought it as favors for a bachelorette party and so did not want to give it away ! it has a really pretty subtle shimmer
4	i ordered this cream hoping it might improve my dcolletage , which is chronically red and bumpy to the point that i did n't feel comfortable wearing low cut dresses and after using it on my neck , jawline , and chest for about 3 weeks , i have some tiny red bumps on my chest , despite this minor reaction , there was an overall marked improvement \( though probably not enough to justify the price \) the consistency of the cream is like a thick school paste , and it does n't emulsify much when warmed in the hands \( not that one wants to use it as a hand cream \) it 's too thick and plasticky to get out of the jar with fingers fortunately , i had a cosmetic spoon from another product that i pressed into service , but at this price , they really should have included a little plastic scoop or spoon my dcolletage , though still and uneven , is much better , and my neck also looks smoother and lighter
5	great barrel size
5	rituals body scrub comes in a pretty containers the color is unique and the texture is surprising it feels very rough to the touch , yet i was shocked that it did n't hurt when you applied it to your body it leaves your skin feelings smooth and refreshed love that it is make with natural products a huge plus product information product description nourishing body scrub based on pure purifying sea salt with warming ginger and refreshing eucalyptus exfoliates and gives your skin a wonderful tingling feeling brand story rituals helps you slow down , to find happiness in the smallest of things it is our passion to turn everyday routines into more meaningful rituals description nourishing body scrub based on pure purifying sea salt with warming ginger and refreshing eucalyptus exfoliates and gives your skin a wonderful tingling feeling benefits made with pure , purifying sea salt , warming ginger and refreshing eucalyptus suggested use apply the scrub to damp skin or over the ritual of black soap and exfoliate with circular
4	it is a little brighter than i expected it to be but that is only a personal preference wish they had the same color but slightly softer
5	i am african american and have been a fan for quite a while i use black for my thin edges i recommended it to a church member who has some thinning issues she reported that she loves it as well i also use the spray applicator and holding spray which works well however , i can just shake the powder on and go without the accessories and it stays all day non one can tell a thing
4	this is very nice nightly lotion it has a good , clean , floral scent it goes on smooth and leaves a nice , soft feel i have very sensitive skin and this did n't irritate it at all i also have large pores on my nose , and this seemed to help a little bit with them , making them slightly smaller after about 7 nights of use it did n't really do anything to help with my dark circles under my eyes overall , it works pretty well , but does n't work on dark spots
5	highly recommend the mitt when it comes to applying the st tropez self tanner unless you want brown hands !
5	i'm often disappointed with other expensive brands claiming to help with age lines and skin problems , but this cream is fantastic ! i immediately felt and saw results within a week ! the little lines near my eyes have filled out giving back 5 years to my face ! i would absolutely save up and repurchase this miracle cream
5	use this product after my colorado esthetician recommended it for my skin as she uses this line read up about the ingredients and like dermalogica uses top quality is a heavy moisturizer and great for dry , aging post menopausal skin types
5	i have used what seems to be every shampoo on the market from the cheap stuff you can buy at the local store to the exclusive expensive salon exclusives when i first researched premium shampoos this came up on every search , and as always i was skeptical to purchase as i did not want it to go to the shampoo graveyard under my sink i have very thick and long hair that is frizzy and unmanageable if i let my hair air dry normally it will look like a huge fluff ball when i received this shampoo i was excited to try it immediately first use was like day and night , my hair was soft , not frizzy for the first time ever upon air drying smell is excellent and you only need a small amount i have had this shampoo for about 3 months and use it 2 3 times a week with over a half bottle left a little really does go a long way i have paired this with the oribe hair care conditioner for beautiful color , 6 8 fl oz and oribe hair care split end seal beautiful color treatment , 1 7 fl oz now my hair is so easy to manage and looks like i received a blowout every time i use it my color has stayed in for 10 weeks while using this so far i am so impressed with the shampoo and other oribe products that i have thrown away everything under the sink ! these products are well worth every penny and even more ! excellent and a must try for anyone
5	i like a subtle look and this is perfect i use very little on the apples of cheeks it can be layered for deeper look \( or i add a darker version of the same cream for a more glam evening look \) i like using the stila cheek cream over stila tinted moisturizer \( i use bare for my fair skin , and sometimes also add a little bit of warm for a light look \) stila products offer a natural , but polished look and the products are terrific for my sensitive skin
4	im really liking this brown body wash it smells great and can smell it throughout the day my only complaint is the price as much as i like the product , im not sure i'm willing to repurchase due to its price
5	i am a big fan of mario badescu 's products and was eager to try this moisturizer it seemed very heavy but was light on my face and left me glowing without feeling greasy it keeps my skin moisturized all day this is a small bottle but will probably last a month considering the drop i need to use daily i ca n't wait to see how it works during winter when i usually develop dry patches on my cheeks and chin hopefully , this will take care of it i will make sure to update then
5	i have a child suffering from and will say that this stuff has been a life saver we are able to avoid the need of a wig thanks to this product i'm not saying it is a perfect product because it can be scratched off or easily removed by water so it is n't an option for swimming , but i'm thrilled with it because my child is able to go to school without a wig which is very big deal for us
2	the smell of this blend is awful it dissipates fairly quickly but really is unpleasant i used the product twice a day on the back of one hand for two weeks and i have seen no difference this is a smooth cream that is not greasy or oily but oh the smell !
5	just started using this product again have used this in the past and it works wonders my skin feels tighter and has a smoother appearance after 1 bottle i have used 3x and 10x strength and i recommend starting at a lower concentration and working your way up if you do not have sensitive skin you may want to start at this is a great product and you only have to apply it at nighttime the smell is quite pleasant also in my opinion
3	i much prefer the scent of eternity now versus eternity it 's lighter , fresher , and not as overpowering the lotion is not overly thick and not too thin or in consistency for me , i soon as i put it on my skin , perhaps because of my body 's chemical reaction , it smelled overwhelmingly like detergent it stayed like that for most of the morning however , by the end of the day , it smelled perfect just like the perfume the scent does stay on for a very long time , even until the next morning perhaps others will have a different experience than i , as it is dependent upon what other products one uses and body chemistry
4	i like the way my skin looks and feels after several uses being in a jar , it is a pain to use
5	i'm a fan of hot tools products my dog ate the cord on my last one and i ran up to the local beauty supply store to get another one it was really expensive at the store so i looked up this product on amazon and it was 10 cheaper got it and it works great it heats up fast i have really long hair and this can make a great curl even w my long hair
5	i have medium length , thick , color treated hair and love the feel the chi silk infusion gives it just use a very sparing amount my hair feels soft and silky after use this has a very pleasant scent and a little goes a long way i'm quite pleased with the results
4	this polish is hard to get despite its popularity for the last 3 4 years that is why a purchase two bottles in case this color will be discontinue \( which i hope not \) its the real essie polish no problems with the delivery and the package was secure amazon did it once again
5	love this i do my own nails and use this for a natural pink color great product
5	i really love this product and , even though , i'm a guy with a beard , this has become part of my every other day shaving routine \( shaping and shaving the neck \) it smells awesome manly and and provides a great cooling experience and i notice a difference in how my skin my feels after just a few days tighter and smoother i use a lot of baxter products \( facial scrubs , shampoo , moisturizer \) and have never been disappointed in the quality which makes them a great value , despite the slightly premium price
4	i like the hydration and that this is easy to apply a little works well , is n't greasy and the tan develops slowly perhaps for darker skin the concerns are less , but for fair skinned like me , you worry that it will look fake , yellow or orange this self tanner looks natural especially as i tried one application and had a healthier look but not particularly tanned , then applied a second time \( again , lightly \) it gives a natural look , at least if you do n't take it too dark for a light skin it lasted a little over a week after the second application even though it hydrates and i'm not sure the color is particularly good for the skin \( though better for it than a real tan or burn \) , so i pretty much use it only for occasions where i particularly o n't want to look pasty
4	this is the second vichy product that i 've tried this vichy purete thermale 3 in 1 product is a cleansing water , a soothing toner , and an eye makeup remover , all in one product i ca n't speak on how well this product works as an eye makeup remover , because i do n't wear eye makeup at all due to very bad allergies , and rubbing my eyes years ago a friend decided to make me up , including eye makeup , and i developed a on my eye i have to say i looked better with makeup on than without it i do wear lipstick or lip gloss daily that 's it ! this product does do a good job as far as a cleansing water and toner i put a little onto a cotton round and wiped it all over my face and neck , then repeated it with another cotton round it left my skin feeling clean and refreshed , soft and not over dry this product is suitable for sensitive skin and eyes , and contains no parabens
5	perfect !
5	good product have used this for a long time
5	excellent product for thin hair , i have been using it for several years and never want to be without it
3	i had this treatment done in the salon and took the bottle home with me my hair looked and felt great so when i ran out , ordered some here not sure if it was the same product it as not as thick and had a different smell when i would comb thru my hair , more hair come hair not sure i would purchase again
5	i 've been using mario badescu products for several years but am to this moisturizer it is quickly absorbed and left my skin feeling soft , hydrated it did n't leaving my face feeling tacky or oily the moisturizer comes in a simple squeezable plastic bottle
5	best price around , beats the mall
3	this seems like nice blush it 's very bright you can see in the photo that it is brighter and darker than the color on the package the package shows a more mellow and warm pink however , the actual product is darker and cooler the packaging is beautiful , but i try not to be by packaging because you do n't leave the house with the package on your face but the cosmetics inside another reviewer said it was a warm pink , but i disagree because i think it 's more neutral than warm it 's bright on my fair skin so i need to go very light with petal pink blush so i do n't look like a clown i 've been using this and really like it because it 's quite natural looking https www amazon com neutrogena healthy blends sheer highlighting dp ref sr 1 6 s it \? s beauty ie utf8 qid sr 1 6 keywords neutrogena blush
5	good product , easy to apply , cream to powder finish medium to full coverage will buy again
5	love it , fast ship trust which is very great business relationship with customers buyers need to trust them and buy it because i have great positive feel with them
5	i 've been shaving with a double edge safety razor for some time now , and i 've always been a of using a real brush and soap \( or , cream \) i 've never been able to get the same protection from an instant product using foam from the can just does n't cut it for a real shave , and pre whipped products like the baxter have never been good enough either until now pros instant just smear it on your face , done awesome protection as good as a very good brush and soap , might not be the very best quality you can get with an experienced hand , but considering the time saving it 's very much worth it cons the formula this product uses to prevent itself from drying out also makes it gunk up a razor like mad , which required some really hot water and a good shake or even taking a razor apart to clean it mid shave since i have a butterfly shaver that 's easy for me , but for someone with a cheaper three piece that might not be so simple bottom line cleaning between strokes is a bit harder and that 's about it a perfect shave instantly , but it 'll be harder to clean your razor for me that 's worth it
5	this is a great face sunscreen for most skin types i like the easy to dispense mini , so it is very compact for anyone on the go the scent is very subtle and not intrusive your face instantly gets moisturized as it gets protection from harmful uv rays and yet it does not feel greasy nor weighs you down i'm pretty sure that men can use this product as well as sun does not if you use a small dab amounts , it should last you for some time however , be sure to check under the bottle for the expiration date , as mine had about a 6 month date until expiration
1	i bought this liquid foundation because my dermatologist recommended it i bought this item because the other 2 liquid foundations i have bought from do n't match my skin color either but i like the coverage so now i mix them together and so far am more satisfied with the mixture than any of the 3 individual tubes
3	ive been using this 2 months now it feels nice , and makes my skin soft , but i have n't noticed any diminishing of fine lines given the price lack of results , would not get this again
5	shipment was normal , arrived in small package so my put it in the mailbox did my nails yesterday and the color is fabulous did it with base coat , two coats of this color and top coat i could do one coat but was afraid that may bubble during drying time i love the color too early to tell how long will last but i would be happy with week to 10 days update polish lasted for 14 days had many compliments on the color until the last day was shiny as the first day
5	this is a great straightener it heats up fast and is easy to use the plates glide along the hair and the addition of the cool mist keeps my hair from getting frizzy the tank is a little tricky to fill \( comes with two tubes of conditioner and recommends using that or distilled water \) but works well once it 's back into the rod there are several temperatures to choose from for straightening i love the style of this too this is the straightener i 've been looking for
5	when i bought this product , i did not read the description thoroughly it is formulated for men in case anyone is wondering that said , my husband and i both really like it it has a very light scent which is both subdued and pleasant it does a good job of exfoliating and rinses off well the 4 oz tube seems to be going quite far even with twice a week usage , as recommended one of the reasons i am giving this product a 5 star rating is because my highly allergic skin did not react adversely to it so despite being a bit pricey , if one is plagued with sensitive skin this product would be worth considering here is a list of the ingredients water \( aqua \) zea mays \( corn \) kernel meal \( walnut \) shell powder dea butylene glycol aloe barbadensis leaf juice carbomer \( \) flower extract disodium edta \( witch hazel \) extract honey \( \) angustifolia \( lavender \) extract propylene glycol officinalis \( rosemary \) leaf extract sodium pca , sodium laureth sulfate sodium 16 vulgaris \( thyme \) extract triethanolamine iodopropynyl butylcarbamate methylparaben propylparaben fragrance \( parfum \) titanium dioxide \( ci 77891 \)
5	exactly as expected
5	i 'd been dying for this color from the day i saw it on the essie site , and for anyone who 's been on there you 'll know it 's been sold out for months ! finally i found it on amazon and i nearly cried it 's the most perfect pink and definitely a must have nail polish color no matter the season , hot pink is always in style , and it 's absolutely perfect for nights out ! it makes me feel ten times hotter when i'm shaking it in the club and my glowing pink tipped nails catch the flashing lights definitely buy this color ! ! ! you need it i swear
4	i just totally the bliss bronzer , but this is a nice product the contour cream is easy to blend i 've been using the lancome double ended contour stick this is like that with one more color i like the two lightest colors , and the darker one is one i'm not sure i will need \( unless i can use it on my hips \? \) they blend well and do n't look like stripes the colors are soft too , you could actually use these as a shadow if you were in a hurry completely natural looking also , no odor or greasy feel big like
5	t3 is a great brand and i love their straightening iron so i was really excited to try their convertible curling iron it heats super fast and has 5 heat settings the unique part about this iron that while this one comes with a 1 25 barrel , you can actually purchase a different size t3 barrel \( sold separately \) and use it with this you simply click the barrel and twist to lock in place you clamp a small section of hair , twist it around the iron and voila you will have gorgeous , soft curls the one con in my opinion is that the whole iron is mostly all white including the barrel and you may accidentally put your hand on the barrel thinking it is safe to touch like the handle other than that , this is a great iron and being convertible , you can get different looks with the same iron by purchasing the different size barrels
4	this is quite easy to apply one can get a mitt separately , but it goes on nicely and smoothly with one 's hands just wash your hands afterwards this is good for maintaining a healthy looking tan through the winter months this also has a more pleasant scent than many tanning lotions definitely recommended
5	although expensive , m g menthol shave cream will help you to a damned fine shave icy cool and minty the best menthol shave cream anywhere is noxzema menthol in the light blue can , but proctor gamble has made this flavor unavailable to the us market since 1997 98 it 's only available now to the united kingdom market and the italian market so , with noxzema menthol effectively gone for americans , m g is a worthy substitute plus , i should add this important note m g offers as close and invigorating a shave as the famous kiehl 's white eagle cream , but m g has one clear advantage it rinses much easier and cleaner from the razor
2	some background i have been doing a korean 10 step beauty routine , or some iteration of it , for the last six months or so , and prior to that i was using facial cleanser , serum , and either a moisturizer or a moisturizing facial oil for some time , so i'm familiar with using oils and some of the for making them work for example , if i'm having a hormonal day where i feel like i might break out , i apply the oil onto my wet hands and rub it around first before applying to my face to kind of dilute the oil and keep me from breaking out other times when i need more moisture , i rubbed the oil onto my dry hands and apply directly i have tried a variety of beauty oils for the face , and i usually like ones with the most natural ingredients , though i do them with using a regular moisturizer just because i find a lot of the oils sit on my face and do n't sink in quite as effectively as i might hope that said , they provide a great barrier of protection for those days when i have to be outside more , because i work as a there are a lot of days when i am in the elements this oil falls short in the ingredients department into really notable ways first , the artificial fragrance is absolutely awful on first sniff , it 's not too bad , however i'm not used to having a facial oil be fragranced given that fragrance is one of the primary skin irritants , and given the fact that people usually use facial oils when they have delicate , sensitive , or aging skin , why in the world would they up a premium product by adding such a common irritant that many people do n't like \? i can tell you that if i want to smell the fragrance on my skin all day , it wo n't be something like this i would instead carefully select a fragranced lotion or perfume i do n't look to my facial oil to provide a fragrant to my day then , later in the ingredients it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil i do n't know about you , but when i cook with vegetable oil , it tends to break me out i do n't see any at all for putting hydrogenated vegetable oil in such an expensive facial oil product there are wonderful facial oils on the market that are fairly inexpensive in comparison to this definitely less than half of the retail price , that do not contain any of this junk in addition , you can find ones for cheaper that have or organic ingredients just here locally , i have a number of vendors blending up beautiful , simple facial oil blends with truly high end ingredients and they do not charge so much money for them i ca n't speak to the long term effects of using this oil because i could n't tolerate it in fact , on the first day of using , i had to wash my face multiple times to try to get the fragrance off , because it was making my face well and making me need to sneeze the fragrance is not that bad , i am just extremely sensitive to fragrance on my skin care products however , i use a number of korean beauty products and even though a few of them do have fragrance , the vast majority do n't have anything like this i 've also used a lot of lush facial products , all of which do have some natural essential oil fragrance , and those do n't bother me either this really smells like a drugstore shampoo , and why in the world they would put it on a facial oil , i really ca n't tell you there is some good stuff in here , but the fact that it 's by an overbearing fragrance and a few questionable ingredients , plus a lack of organic or oils , makes me think that the price tag is just due to cindy crawford 's name and not due to the ingredients it 's a shame from reading the ingredients i had higher hopes
5	aaa
5	it smells like leather and tobacco i do n't smoke but love the smell of tobacco unlike many modern male scents , this is for men only i would n't be surprised if wears this
5	i had already fallen in love the crabtree evelyn 's honey coriander scent from using their ultra moisturizing hand therapy \( which is also fantastic ! \) this lotion has the same wonderful scent but in a formula that is thinner and easier to massage into your body wherever you need it , it 's great for soothing the dry winter itch that i get on my legs every year it absorbs fairly quickly without feeling greasy , and does a really good job of moisturizing this is definitely something i will be getting more of when it 's gone while the scent does seem a bit strong at first it does fade quite a bit after a while , but it does linger for a long time so if you are overly sensitive to scents and perfumes than crabtree evelyn 's products are probably not the best choice for you
5	strong , works well , i use it once in awhile , if my skin is breaking out , or
4	great color , a good summer go to shade
5	works surprisingly well
5	very pretty color rich and goes with any season
5	first , my profile 52 , white female , aging sun damaged skin , semi fit , about 12 over ideal weight because fat does matter , especially when considering facial products and results i am genuinely amazed that this device actually produced such significant results for me and literally , almost immediately ! i used the nuface device for about 10 minutes , every day for 6 consecutive days then stopped using it for 4 days to test the length of my results manufacturer suggests using it 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks , then go to 2 3 days a week to maintain results the nuface trainer , literally lifted up my jowl and cheeks in just the first 2 treatments i have never been able to my aging jaw line , other than with my hands to hold them up in front of a mirror , and have been the past few years about eventually having to to a because no skincare product alone could every reverse sag due to genetics , gravity , and little too much facial fat until now i am blown away this little machine has some type of micro current that when placed upon face with slight pressure and a gliding motion it has lifted and toned my face like nothing i thought ever possible without surgery it really is revolutionary for beauty and skincare age reversal i do n't work for the company or get any benefits , other than my own personal results from the product , it has just flat worked miracles for me ! now , the downside could be that in order to retain the lift , we have to consistently use the device ! it does n't take long , in as little as 5 minutes , but i have really focused extended treatments on my upper neck , jowls , lower and upper cheeks , for about a total of 10 12 minutes each use when i stopped using the product so i could review it here , i did notice since i had only been using it for one week , results began to after the third day of not using the trainer daily as required i started back last night and intend to follow the directions of use for 60 days , then start the maintenance schedule of 3x a week i also have briefly used the wrinkle reducer led attachment , and love the feel of it , but have only used it twice , so i ca n't comment further until i know more also , the gel primer that comes with the nuface trainer is a must ! it provides glide and allows the microcurrent of the device to penetrate the skin i do use quite a bit , so re ordering the gel primer will be necessary , about every 30 days , depending on usage it feels great , and no objections to the primer , other than the cost to re order as needed but with the results i have experienced , it will be worth 20 a month to continue using the nuface device !
3	i gave this to my wife , and here 's what she had to say this product feels like most night creams on my middle aged skin slightly thick , creamy it goes on smooth and leaves my face feeling hydrated unfortunately for replenix , i also recently tried l'oreal age perfect cell renewal night cream which is much thicker , much smoother and makes my skin feel amazing i can still feel the of that other product the next morning , and it is much , much cheaper sorry , replenix
5	i did a ton of research before selecting this hot tools curling iron i considered purchasing this same item at ulta , but after finding it here on amazon it was a no brainer i have curling wands which i prefer to use and work well , but i wanted a larger barrel curling iron with a clamp to quickly and easily do my front bangs with this works perfectly for that i even find that i reach for this to do my regular curls , whereas i 'd normally switch to a curling wand i like this curling iron because my hair does n't get stuck on the barrel , and the clamp is easy to use and does n't seem to stick i did a lot of testing at ulta and compared how different barrels and worked on my hair type , and this one was a winner for me ! i have n't \( yet ! \) had any problems with the black enamel flaking off , but i do n't use it everyday i use it maybe 2 or 3 times per week , and it seems to be fine for me
5	i had never heard of this brand before but it is really a quality product it smells wonderful i like the definition and bouncy curls without stiffness it does n't weigh my hair down this is a winner
5	nia 24 was recommended by my derm for sun damage it works so well i bought other products from the same line the brown spots have disappeared to only a shadow and im sure they will continue to fade out also used on my hands with the same results
4	it is a beautiful lipstick and i love how it glides on my lips it is soft and long lasting i love how it does n't make my lips look old it does hydrate my lips and the color stays on for a long time i love lipstick and lip glosses and this is the first time i have ever tried jouer and so far , i like this brand i normally do n't spend this much on lipstick as a mom of , i just do n't have the time to even swipe on lipstick before rushing out the door i might reconsider that decision now that i have tried this brand the only problem i have with this is that vine gave me this shade , which is a lot brighter and a lot pinker than what it seems on the screen of my computer i am not a bright pink lipstick kind of lady i am more into the roses and mauves so fair warning , this shade is a bit brighter than what it seems on the computer screen other than that , i am pleased with this product who knows \? maybe the bright pink will grow on me 4 23 14
1	it left the stain on my nails after removed
5	is a deep , multi layered scent that takes a few minutes to develop and manages to last all day long ! perfume is really an individual taste and there is really no way to review a scent since it will smell different on different people this is definitely not a run of the mill scent it does not resemble the standard cool water , ck one and other milder perfumes that tend to lack a distinct personality stands out , just like the pink desert city it is named for the bottle i got was very definitely the real thing it lasted all day and the scent is very appealing to me
1	i guess i should have read the reviews before i ordered , this polish has absolutely no shine ! it looks terrible , hate it ! ! !
5	calvin klein eternity eau de parfum has a product description white flowers and creamy woods topnotes freesia , mandarin , sage , white lily , marigold , basenotes sandalwood , patchouli , amber upon initial application , i can smell the floral topnotes along with just a passing hint of sage that dissipates within a few minutes , revealing that are floral but without being either cloying or overwhelming with the of 30 minutes or so , the basenotes with an enticing mixture of sandalwood , amber and patchouli the basenotes will linger , making them eternity 's signature aroma and for which it will be best remembered very pleasing in all , everyone that i introduced to eternity eau de parfum enjoyed its subtle mixture of floral , wood and spice elements a single application lasts for 3 4 hours this is a subtle and elegant perfume
5	i am a loyal customer and user of elizabeth arden 's red door eau de parfume for years like i reviewed the red door edp eau de parfume it seems that where ever i go when people \( men as well as ladies \) smell it on me they absolutely have to ask me what are you wearing you smell so good ! because of the constant compliments of how great i smell i decided that i would always buy and wear this perfume when i wear any other perfume i do n't get any compliments so why buy and wear anything else \? after getting this perfume years ago and receiving so many fantastic compliments i decided to buy all the other products of red door i do wear this deodorant and all the other products from red door daily i love using this cream deodorant and it lasts such a long time too ! another favorite of mine is the red door perfumed body lotion and the dusting powder they all just compliment the perfume i wish they would come out with other products as well such as a liquid hand soap my husband and daughter know that if they ever want to give me the perfect gift they ca n't go wrong with red door !
5	works very good
4	this powder goes on easy , and covers well it has light coverage , but stays on like a liquid it is a heavier powder , so it does n't brush away when applied the compact has a mirror , and it is a high quality compact i like the of the powder , and the compact is really nice i ca n't tell how much you actually get , because the powder is set into the compact , so i do n't know how much you get for the price time will tell if you are willing to spend a decent chunk of money to find out , go for it if you are looking for a powder that stays in place like a liquid , then give this a try i like it , but i am going to stay with my usual nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href tarte amazonian clay 12 hour full coverage foundation spf 15 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 tarte amazonian clay 12 hour full coverage foundation spf 15 a
4	pretty color , but not as opaque as i 'd hoped even with 3 coats , the white of my nails is visible
5	so happy i purchased this ! smells so good ! its the real thing
3	i tried this with my mac makeup and also with some other cheaper stuff \( a mix of revlon and max factor \) it does make a difference when you 're wearing the cheaper stuff i did n't notice a difference with my mac this is not expensive if used correctly even everyday it 's a 3 oz liquid for 29 , i'm not sure why people think they 'd get a huge bottle for that price i'm not a fan of the alcohol in it
4	the color was a lot darker than i had expected it reminds me of sally hasen 's brick wall , which i already have
5	love this glitter polish , it is perfect ! very fine light glitter it 's great for an accent color on top
4	i love the purple color it 's not in your face purple , but almost a little more pink and soft looking the one thing that i'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen it 's not really matte and not shiny i have n't decided how i feel about that
5	my home smells like a posh place without ! , like spraying a room with a perfume made for it love it ! and all my guests have given me many , many compliments on how wonderful my home is smelling these days a great find !
5	performs as advertised
5	great product ! !
5	la roche posay body lotion daily repair moisturizing 400 ml 13 52 fl oz , spreads smoothly , gets absorbed quickly , moisturizes well , and is not greasy the best , most effective applications are taking it after shower bath , on daily basis before sleeping , for deep moisturizing especially in dry environments \( dry climate , winter , or air conditioned heated rooms spaces quarters \) , and against dry skin in general after the use , the dry skin hydration increases resulting in a visible improvement in the skin smoothness and softness nevertheless , the wrinkles somewhat lost their depth and without any doubts however , the lotion made the skin more delicate that might have been an byproduct of its increased softness for the same reason , the skin became min more sensitive to touch and prone to scratch , but at the same time faster healing for its increased moist , as under a band aid it is mid priced obviously , it does not contain triclosan , which finally was found toxic \( see 5 things to know about triclosan fda \) and a candidate for a by the food and drug \( fda \) in the usa \( see toxic triclosan banned from soap but lingers in consumer products \)
3	this worked well as a scrub i felt like it exfoliated my skin well i still needed to apply moisturizer after my shower but i have very dry skin so it might be moisturizing enough by itself for some people the fragrance was way to strong when my husband came home from work several hours after my shower , he thought i had cleaned the house because the whole house smelled like the scrub ! it stayed on my skin until the next day and my shower smelled like it for days i like a more subtle smell to my beauty products !
5	i have sensitive skin and a sensitive nose and because of that i do n't like most fragrances and have to stay clear of anything oily or fruity \( talking to you garnier \) when it came to this vichy serum i did n't know what to expect but i really like it it has virtually no smell and it is very light on your skin hard to tell it 's there at all i ca n't tell you how long the moisturizing lasts because i do wash my face ever day and my regimen is to put it on in the morning and at night mostly because with the onset of the beginning of fall my skin has suddenly gone exceedingly , ridiculously dry the consistency is not a lotion it 's definitely a serum , clear and white both and very liquid when you use it do n't push the pump all the way down a little goes a long way a partial pump covers my entire face one thing i will note is that when i began using this serum my face was a winter disaster already at the point where lotions irritated it and this serum was no exception it did n't my skin or cause breakouts , but it did burn a little bit this was n't because of the product though but because of the state of my dry , irritated skin after using this for a couple days that stopped happening basically because my skin had caught up on moisture worth trying
4	this is my first time to use la roche posey mascara brand i chose black color because i love my eyelashes to be pronounced sometimes just wearing mascara and a little bit of eyeliner can give my eyes the pop with some brands of mascara i experienced allergy in the past but luckily my eye did not complain about this brand i put the mascara on in the morning and it lasts fine without any irritation while i am in the office mascara does not smudge and eyelashes do not look clumped together all in all , mascara gives nice , clean look to the eyes this mascara is waterproof it is easy to remove with the make up removed \( i use shiseido make up remover at the moment and have no issues taking mascara off \)
5	i used la roche posay for years , but mostly their sun block products , because i have sun sensative skin and could n't be outside without it i started using their skin care line and it works really well too , but this product just amazed me after 7 days of use , my redness went way down , my pores are smaller and wrinkles are way remember , you have to keep this water in refrigerator
5	love this color it just might be my new summer color it has just enough sparkle with a beautiful pale pink
1	online this looked ok but in real life it is awful most colors are pretty true to form from the website but this one was awful
1	will not charge and the company will not refund your money buyer beware
5	best toner exfoliater for cystic acne
5	this mineral tinted crme is not only a pleasure to use but it is a very important product first of all , it looks gorgeous on my skin it provides lovely coverage and my skin looks fresh , not mask y like so many foundations and creams it looks like i do n't even have anything on yet it covers my brown spot ! secondly , having had a on my face a few years ago i swear by all products that provide good quality sunscreen so what more we want than a fabulous beauty product and sun protection \? ! !
5	some good classic sandalwood with long lasting protection and use
4	overall , i like this eau de parfum , but am definitely not in the love it category there are many scents happening at the same time , which may appeal to some , and to which others may be adverse it is not a light fragrance , and that said , my 17 year old daughter does n't like it as difficult as it is to describe a fragrance in words , especially given that it 's all totally subjective , i would say that this fragrance is one of those that women will immediately like or dislike as it 's not one of those beat around the bush scents that you need to it 's definitely got musk , citrus , floral and tea notes happening , and i would honestly say that it 's not a strong feminine fragrance \( but does have a sweet finish \) and has shades of more masculine scents like i said , a lot of different scents happening all at once , and a little goes a long way i do like it , but do n't know if i 'd actually pick it up and buy it for myself , as i have other fragrances that i really adore , and to add the fact that it 's not a very inexpensive perfume the bottle itself is unique , but very heavy and bulky
5	this product makes you look lit from within i have very pale skin and it has always been hard to find a highlighting powder however , my friend 's with olive toned or dark skin loves this product , too ! it has a slight shimmer without looking like glitter , it has no fall out , looks natural on the skin and is build able i use a bit more product in the tear ducts to make my eyes look bigger
4	great product and easy for daily use
5	i 've been on the hunt for a good curling iron i tried everything , nothing was working to my satisfaction or holding a curl longer than an hour or two i got this randomly wondering what all the hype was about and i love it i got a haircut my stylist called a , a bit shorter in the back coming down a little longer by the face i 've been dying for cute beach waves but i'm a hair and lazy in the beauty department on top of it this was super easy to use and fast the first time i used it i did n't use any product and it stayed till the following day it fell over time into the perfect beach wave i use it on the slower setting so i can make sure it wo n't take off without me being ready i usually at the high priced beauty tools , they all get hot right \? apparently i was wrong i'm a convert i also found it almost forty five dollars cheaper with some coupon through buy this
5	i just love the sparkle of this polish i 've had it done twice at the salon and now must own a bottle so i can do it at home ! it is not a sheer or cream shade , rather a translucent shade with a tint of pink \( you will see white finger nail tips if used on its own \) i have n't tried layering yet but i'm looking forward to experimenting !
5	great product great shipping thanks
3	the anthelios 50 mineral is a great high spf sunscreen with a good formulation , like most la roche posay sunscreens , but the tint does n't work for me the formula is indeed lightweight , sinks quickly into the skin and has a dry touch finish it works well both alone and under make up , offering me good protection under the california sun it 's somewhat sweat resistant \( for runs and long \) , i do n't swim so i ca n't say if it 's really water resistant the finish is matte on my combination skin while i really loved the formula , i do n't like the tint for my light medium complexion is neither too dark or light , it provides almost no coverage , but leaves a grey ashy tint that looks on me
3	the sample box was okay except my perfume sample was missing the holder was there but not the perfume sample other than that , it 's fine
1	i used thus according to instructions and the polish came right off my regular polish with and top coat stays on longer
5	we have been using chi silk infusion for a number of years if you have any damage to your hair especially if your hair is color treated you 'll find that this will dramatically improve the texture and manageability of your hair when your hair is wet , it can be almost impossible to get a comb through it not only will this the tangles , your hair will dry without any stiffness or oily feel i promise you will definitely feel the difference in the way your hair handles as you style it , and the shine is amazing worth every penny for the results !
5	this is one of the very few beauty products i'm completely sold on it really does reduce the dark circles and baggy look under my eyes with regular use my skin was noticeably improved after about a month of use this is the one expensive skin product i will not go without
5	this powder foundation does everything i want applies smoothly , lasts throughout the day , and has great coverage it 's dermablend so i expected better than average coverage , but i was pleasantly surprised at the overall smoothness and even tone the only downside for me is this tone was lighter than i expected so i use it for the center of my face and highlights , alongside a darker tone foundation for the chin jaw and outer part
5	this product is amazing !
5	a reorder love these
5	love this new color !
5	works great , my skin feels soft after use
5	never hear of this brand polish until accessing it via amazon great product , nice fall color friends love the color when i wear it
5	it does what it claims ! !
5	love this shade
3	applied this dermablend to half my face , just so i could accurately review my own experience in a comparison with my usual makeup routine to be fair , note that i do n't have the dermablend foundation and instead used my own mineral liquid foundation , so my results may not be as they 'd be with someone who uses both together what i found is i could n't really see a marked difference between one side of my face and the other , as far as how it looked , and i looked under different lights it may have been a little different but it was so slight that it made it negligible i did n't want to apply more , but maybe it calls for more , or it calls for the dermablend foundation to work together the side with the dermablend powder did set my makeup better when i took a white tissue and rubbed across both sides of my face , the side without the dermablend powder had more come away on the tissue than on the side that had the dermablend powder i did n't see any caking or noticeable powder residue , but i buffed my face really well with a buffing makeup brush after the 2 3 minutes of setting i will suggest to women who say they have peach fuzz on their face to consider they run from the of prices so you can find one having a smooth face helps your makeup go on smooth , and the powders wo n't sit the skin i did n't feel made up it did n't sit heavy on my skin it 's messy be careful opening it the first time , and every time really the big white powder puff thing is ridiculously puffy big and you have to work the lid back on over it i 'll likely throw that away and use my big buffing brush on the days i want to use a powder like if it 's going to be humid and i need extra setting \( this would n't be something i 'd need in the dry weather times in the mountains , but i could see needing this when i visit down south in the humidity ! \) the color looked dark on the white puff when i first looked at it , but on my face it blended nicely it 's difficult to review this fairly , really , without having the dermablend foundation my experience using my own foundation was mixed but , the dermablend is n't super expensive and there 's enough to last a very long time if you need a setting powder and like the dermablend brand , then i do recommend this otherwise , i'm neutral about this product , since i am very happy with the way my regular foundation looks and sets however , as written above , i 'd use this when visiting down south where it is super humid and i need a little more setting to keep my makeup from sliding off !
4	great coverage , this really concealed all my blemishes and freckles it is easy to apply and has a smooth matte finish i would purchase this in the future
5	i have been performing the cnd shellac process on my nails at home for approximately six months i have been using this color on my nails for most of that time when i chose to send the entire cnd process to my daughter as a gift , this is the color i chose because it was such a lovely color she is loving it also i would categorize this color more as a pink orange rather than a true orange color as the photo indicates i have found it to be long wearing as are all the shellac colors personally , i like to have a matching regular nail polish to use for touch ups just in case i get a flaw in the shellac process before i have time to redo my nails i have found the sally diamond strength something new to work quite well with the tropix color as an added note i have read where lots of women are purchasing other brands of gel uv colors to mix and match with the cnd shellac process however , i recently read where the cnd shellac products actually have tiny in the polishes after curing that allow the solar oil to penetrate to the nail for other brands do not have this process i had considered other brands to have some variety in the color choices but have decided to stick with the entire process being the cnd brand also , six new colors are coming out for fall 2012 and those colors can be viewed on several blogs by doing a search for them
5	my husband loves this shaving cream and has tried every brand you can possibly think of he smells so good and his face is so smooth after shaving with proraso , i call it a girls best friend ! he really liked till he tried proraso the only problem was deciding on which fragrance to choose problem solved , we got them all and honestly love all of them equally and would have a difficult time choosing which one we like best i use the menthol one myself , it 's a girl or guy fragrance and i'm a girl ! this is a really excellent product , it lasts a very long time too and if he 's going to be smooth for me should n't i return the favor ! he loved the aftershave lotion too
5	my first bottle broke during transit but the second one i saw this color on a blog for a fall nail polish collection and this green my heart it was very pretty , but definitely , need more than two coats
4	if you 're into unique , subtle scents , calvin klein 's ck one is for you it reminds me of unisex fragrances that had their in the 90s it 's , with the hint of a floral i like it for myself , as a non girly change of pace for my usual perfume of choice my husband likes it but on me , not on him ! we share everything , but we like smelling different !
3	it 's a pricy concentrate and although i like it and it feels good , it does n't do enough to my rosacea i do n't have bad rosacea but i do have very dry skin and do get red patches that get itchy and i would have expected this product to do more for me than it does i would n't buy it again
4	when the package arrived the container lid was slightly off so the power had spilled a little bit
1	originally , i loved this iron however , after a couple of months , it stopped working properly the light flashes and does n't heat continually , so it was definitely faulty i contacted the seller and they said they could do nothing about it so , it was a waste of money
4	as someone that has used everything from la prairie to olay and everything in between , vichy is one of my favorite skin care lines in my opinion , a serum is just about the most important step to facial skin care not only is it the base for everything else , and helpful in its own right , but it also how well the product in your next step that is placed on top of it is going to work this one goes on smoothly , allowing you to lightly your face through using techniques just enough before drying in about 2 weeks there was a slight improvement in crows feet my only complaint is that the top was cracked , and about a third of the serum had leaked out in defense of vichy , i seem to have a post office where packages are about not in defense of vichy , the product has no sanitary precautions , such as a safety seal film on the top
5	the brit rhythm struck me as bold , fresh , and pleasing without being overpowering it is great for everyday use at the office , going out , and special occasions the bottle is exquisite rectangular , edgy , and looks stunning the all glass shell makes nice for leaving out on the desk no need to hide this guy i am in love i feel confident
3	this lotion is sticky and i'm not crazy about the scent i imagine it 's as good as any other suntan lotion , and i'm certain others will like it but it 's not for me
5	good colors
4	once they get the price down this will sell in my wife loves how easily this applies , especially how well designed the foam applicator itself is it 's gentle , smooth , and goes on flawless the length is great too i'm not sure if this is what 's supposed to make it anti fatigue , but the length and thickness seem to help make it more ergonomic the flawless nature of the application are five stars , but 40 for a foam brush , not so much maybe keep an eye out for a sale
5	fast shipping ! loved this color i usually go for darker reds and thought i 'd try something different absolutely love it for fall !
5	i like it i think because of the softness of the scent and the floral notes that it should be marketed as a unisex scent but the cedarwood gives it enough earthiness to make it also suitable for men i ordered it for my husband because he likes burberry scents he likes it but i wore it for a couple days last week and got a couple of positive comments on it people wanted to know what it was it 's not a strong scent , one of the people was a stranger in a crowded elevator and the other , a friend who smelled it when me hello it 's kind of a soft scent i love the bottle design which i would describe as simple sophistication actually , the scent could be described that way too
3	this one is just ok it 's a creamy white lotion that absorbs quickly into the skin and works within a couple of hrs putting it on is tricky because it 's not tinted so make sure you do a good job applying it also out of the tube the cream smells fantastic fast forward to a couple of hrs and the smell of self tanner is very prominent and strong , so much so , that my eyes watered until i was able to wash my face a couple of times the color itself has an orange tint which i'm not a fan of , i have olive skin so prefer other products for my face this one was n't the best for the face for the body , i only used it on my legs , the result was okay , very similar to most tanning creams out there
4	i love the ceramic hair dryer the only reason i did n't give 5 stars , it is heavy it does n't bother me though but may some
4	it was the size i needed , heats up fast and gives long hair full wavy curls good value for the price my naturally straight hair does not hold the curl for very long but this tool does what is expected and is easy to use i also like that it is gold in color !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	they advertise that it takes 10 days to see results , but it only took 5 days for me to see results very happy !
5	i like this set , because it has three different ones all designed to target different issues \( of which i have problems will all three ! \) they are smaller than i , but a little goes a long way ! all three work well , i have been very pleased with this set the tub smells a little stronger than the other two and the pink one has a faint smell as well the white one does n't really smell at all make sure you mix both the pink and white ones well before applying !
5	i love this conditioner ! it helps keep my red brighter for longer and smells great it makes my hair soft without weighing it down , too
4	not sure how much good it is doing dr recommended it i still see dark spots
5	i normally do n't use foundation , but i decided to give this a try it went on smoothly and did not feel like i was applying a heavy or gooey spackle to my face it was actually what i would describe as light it was fairly even and consistent i had a slight problem with a little streaking and i remedied it by applying a little more i finished this all with brush applied face powder my freckles were gone which would recommend this for frequent use very nice product which left me looking a little and fresh looking
3	this is the first time i 've ever heard of an anti aging lip treatment being in my 50 's , this is something that i wanted to try i do n't have the feathering lines around the lip area \( yet \) , but who ca n't use a good treatment \? this has a light pleasant citrus scent just a little amount makes my lips feel smooth and the taste is n't bad either however , i did n't feel like the treatment did anything more than a good lip balm would do except for the fact that it 's supposed to help with the aforementioned feathering lines , i ca n't see paying so much money for this product
5	love it , love it , love it once i do my hair stays until next shampoo i have very long and heavy hair have been using it for over 6 months and every time i do , i receive numerous compliments first couple of times i used my hair got caught and took me minute to
5	i saw this color at the salon and knew i had to have it i got a pedicure with it at the salon , and when i applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter , but i actually like it better like that i used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle
4	this light foam makes my skin feel clean without feeling dry i just had a facial peel and am happy to have this product to keep up the maintenance it is not overly perfumy if your face gets too dry with soap , you may want to give this a try this is made for oily skin , so i only use it in the morning when i feel kind of greasy if you have super dry skin , this foam may not be for you
5	hope all of you are having a great shave ! in this review i will touch upon some tips to follow to maintain the longevity of this soap in particular if you 're wanting to know more about the philosophy of the proraso company and how it is presented in the shaving industry , then i would advise you to check my detailed review of the proraso red or the sandalwood proraso tub my first experience of this soap me to another review i just posted for the proraso pre shave cream in the green tub i linked this soap to its pre shaving cream for the purpose of how different each component plays an important role in terms of scent and performance the green shaving soap is different from the cream through one clear factor the shaving soap is more soapy in scent and less cologne , in other words it 's more fresh scented , mildly in strength and powdery to the nostrils than the pre shaving cream usually one would say both products should be identical well not here with proraso that 's why i love this company because each single product holds its own line of effect and performance the pre shave cream is there for the face prep and therefore it will give you the first of what is yet to come holding that sensational pleasant feel , by the soap , you will add another layer of experience the luxurious sheen and cushion will be with the cream in a pleasant marriage you will know when the soap is added by just the smell of it some people might shy away from the handful usage of menthol products , i have to say no to the case of this brand , the shave was still pleasant and the menthol did n't overwhelm my nostrils and eyes when i combined both shockingly the only difference was the change in sent and the menthol sensation through the three passes did n't tone down or built up it stayed the same some shaving soaps in the industry have a repeating trend of building up the effect of coolness by every pass in a shave when combining the two products of this company the soap and pre shave , you get something those companies fail to accomplish , the word is consistency and balance i have tried blooming this soap for one reason , although it 's a soft soap i wanted to experience more to what this soap has to offer the slickness was intensified by this soap alone , i did this once without using the pre shaving cream it was a delight ! now in order to maintain the life and performance of this product i would like to share with you some tips that you will find useful after i load my brush with any soap i directly rinse the tub clean from the excess soap with water i then place it face down on a towel i leave it over night to air dry , never leave your tub facing upwards this will force the water to stay in the soap and what you will end up with is a slimy gooey substance , nearly half eaten soap the water will react to soap like it reacts to soaps in general you will the longevity of this product and in less than 10 shaves you will find yourself with an empty tub sooner than you know it this soap can last forever if maintained properly never load the brush and close the tub immediately by doing so you are creating a vacuum area and a chance for bacteria to form with the foam that is already on the tub that was formed while loading the brush this is very important to have in mind because this bacteria can give us a bad shaving experience and increase the chance of our faces getting this is not a common happening but science does tell us that bacteria of some sorts do effect our skin so just be careful so by placing the tub and leaving it to naturally air dry you will allow whatever water to go down naturally with the effect of gravity and you will be able to maintain a safe product to be used on your face every time you shave , for a long long time people often get nervous especially ones like me that own over 60 soaps and by looking at the date they tend to have the urge to rush and finish a product without enjoying it guys this is a soap it 's is water as long as it is dry , soaps can last for years and years they are even selling vintage soaps 60 years old plus on ebay you find people paying amounts on why \? because they are soaps if maintained you can use them for decades ! one shaving soap you can on ebay is the vintage known as the might old spice if you find a \( new old stock soap with its cup and sealed \) do me a favor and check the price on it people in the wet shaving community live by collecting these another tip i while shaving through the year that i would like to add here because of the special package of this product is once you finish this soap do n't discard the container , , , keep it ! there are countless options for using this tub to me i use it to put in another soap , sometimes it 's cheaper to purchase a refill , instead of buying a soap with a tub there are some cases where you can save yourself a minimum of 60 bucks with a refill some companies add a lot of money to a soap by in a ceramic bowl , a wooden bowl , or a bowl that they created from heaven in the end of the day it 's just a soap a wooden bowl might expand and crack if you bloom the soap in it or by just exposing it to the slightest drop of water the ceramic bowl might break and shatter with your slippery hands while loading the brush always think positive why i say this with proraso is because unlike other plastic products out there , this is well created product and is a good grade of plastic that can be used over and over again with no worries of getting any chemical reactions to the soap this whole idea of wet shaving should add pleasure to your life it 's really beneficial for your skin health , and boy you will love it ! shave on ! ladies and ! ps there is one thing i want to say , is if you ever want to purchase a shaving soap from proraso , is get this one before you head to the sandalwood red tub , why \? because there have been countless and complaints across the web of people actually having their face irritated by getting a slight burning sensation on their face while placing the red tub lather some might say it 's the contents found in the ingredients of the tub , and they end up this green one to me it 's not the case , i have found both scents and types a pleasure to shave with even with my extra sensitive skin and hard stiff stubble to me it 's all about face prep , and that comes before anything else to me it actually improved my shaves and experiences drastically plus we only have one face for god 's sake so to put all aside i actually recommend you to give this tub a try first and then move the red tub shave on !
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	boyfriend loved it i love it he smells great ca n't keep my hands off him
5	love essie products and love this color looks great and lots of fun for summer very bright would definitely recommend
5	great product
5	i 've used this product for years it totally works and fills in the hair that i 've lost it makes the difference between looking nearly bald and having hair i recommend this to anyone with thinning hair
3	i swear by a bb cream that this company makes it 's expensive , but worth it i appreciate that this mascara is said to be good for sensitive eyes , but do n't think it 's worth the high price compared to maybelline great lash mascara at about 1 4 the price the latter is a favorite of many makeup artists and only require one coat this mascara requires at least 2 coats to get fuller looking lashes and the tube wo n't last long
5	i thought i had the very best eye brown pencil out there but have changed my mind after using the vincent longo micro pencil i really like how it goes on and how it fills in places it just glides on so easy and does n't have that waxy crayon look it looks as if you had n't used a brow pencil because it looks so natural it also does n't smear i have on my right eyebrow a area almost as big as the end of a pencil before it is sharpened and it did n't matter what i used it would n't fill in so i was very excited when the vincent longo brow pencil filled in to where it looks like the rest of my eyebrow now i will be ordering the vincent longo brand i hope it helps those of you who are looking for a really good eye brow pencil
5	this polish , as with many glitter polishes , should be used over a base coat of a french pink shade the color is slightly pink of the lacquer itself while the glitter is a light shade of gold this item matched very well the stock photo and i am very pleased with this shade , and the butter london nail polish line
5	i do n't normally wear foundation i hate the way i can feel it sitting on my skin and do n't like how it can look artificial this expensive small pan of water based foundation those two problems for me this feels light and cool going on , and is imperceptible to me i ca n't feel it at all it evens out my skin tone , conceals my mild rosacea , and looks like perfect beautiful skin rather than makeup this is only 4 ounces , and the container is anything but luxe it is a screw lid , not a compact , hardly the type of case such an expensive makeup should come in but the genius is in the formula i applied this first with a fingertip i only needed a small amount in the center of my face to look flawless while this is not heavy coverage , it is more than enough coverage to even out redness if you need heavier coverage , this wo n't work for that but for light natural beautiful looking coverage , like you have naturally perfect skin , this is beyond anything i 've tried before it looks the way good airbrushed makeup can look it gives a very smooth even glowing finish , neither oily nor waxy i found that the best way to apply this is with a small makeup sponge which has been lightly dampened the makeup in the pan is hard but with a damp sponge it comes up easily and applies smoothly you have to work fast because within seconds it dries but this is n't a problem , as this blends easily upon application this has zero scent or perfume at all this is the first water based makeup i 've ever loved usually they look chalky and mask like on me the third ingredient in this is talc , one ingredient i have always avoided i dislike anything dry looking but in this , the talc is imperceptible i received the color called bisque i thought it might be too pale for me but it is perfect in the pan it looks tan but on my skin it blends in like it was custom blended for me this makeup lets your own skin show through , but it enhances it in a way i 've never experienced in makeup before i have pale skin but it is warm without pink tones bisque is perfect i am not sure that matching exactly would be difficult with this makeup it is sheer and enhances your skin tone rather than covering it up i think it 's extremely bold to sell four of an ounce of foundation for 57 and i considered knocking this down at least one star for that but in marketing it 's what the consumers will pay , and they are paying for this without a problem i think it would be more to people if you got a full ounce of this the ingredients probably cost a few cents , particularly since this says it is 75 water i ca n't feel this makeup on my face nor can i see it all i can see is glowing radiant perfect looking skin i cringe at the price of this but would i buy it again , in spite of the cheap looking case and small amount you get \? you bet i would
4	i 've tried several of the dermablend foundations and this one is my favorite my makeup and me i'm an older mom with super sensitive skin which is also dry these days except on my forehead i do n't wear a lot of makeup by preference my life just does n't demand it now , but there are times when i go out that i would like freckles , small red veins , and whatnot covered and while other dermablend foundations covered they were too thick and heavy and i guess now that i do n't wear makeup every day , i'm sensitive to the weight this foundation though was light and had good coverage i really liked the narrow tip that it dispenses from it is liquid and very very easy to apply it did n't irritate my skin at all it also was n't greasy it finishes as a nice matte the only place where coverage was n't perfect for me was on my forehead note that it 's in the mid 90s outside and the humidity is very high and i 've found that if i do n't want to look shiny i need to dust a little free powder over the foundation on my forehead
5	this review will be from a makeup artist 's perspective i have had the opportunity to use many gel liners and i have learned to use them for a variety of purposes in makeup i plan to update this review with photos if i am able to , but for now , a brief summary is how i am going to start what is this product like \? if you are used to using other gel liners like buxom or mac , for example , this gel liner might be a challenge for you it is a brilliant bronze gold color and the consistency is very mousse like it is so light that it can be a challenge to apply well the particles are glittery , but when put in a line you do n't see them how to best apply this product for this liner you are going to need a liner brush that is densely packed and quite stiff with just a little give to it you are best to dip the brush into the gel liner and then work the product evenly into the bristles and then apply a line test it on your hand first until you get the hang of it i prefer to use a slanted brush with this , but i also have a densely packed liner brush which is not an angled brush and that applies well too how well does it wear i have found that if applied well the first time \( working the product into the bristles evenly \) that this will stay in place all day on lids that are not excessively oily i have only had to apply once and it is fine for the day , especially if set with powder or shadow on top another use if you use a good eye cream which soaks into the lid quickly and well , you can apply to your lid , then use a synthetic flat brush with rounded tip it is designed for cream eyeshadow you can quickly apply to the lids as an eyeshadow as well and when the cream has set , so will the shadow and stay in place all day long the cream on the lid gives you time to work , and gives that ability to do a wash effect and not look patchy the bottom line this is a bit of a tricky gel liner to use , but once you get the hang of it , it is beautiful metallic liner it stays in place all day if you are careful to follow a few steps you can also use this as an eyeshadow on the lids a little goes a long way if you keep this covered at all times even while using , it will last quite some time five stars for now i will update as i have more experience with it should the information contribute to the overall evaluation of the product i also plan to add a photo or two if i am able to as well
4	no complaints here used on pretty dry skin , provided moisture for the rest of the day note goes on thick , but not overly greasy blends in just fine smells clinical upon initial application , but this does n't last but a moment after that , it is basically odorless
3	the tube has a small nozzle which makes it easy to control the amount dispensed the coverage is good and the color is even lasts all day despite what it seems , the tube is non transparent so you ca n't really tell the color just by looking at the tube the color name is printed on the tube , but , if you use different colors , it would be nice to be able to tell the color of the toner by the color of the container
1	i wanted to like this product i had read about it on a site other than amazon i was looking for a good product for my oily hair this product was so watery that i could n't get it from my hands to my hair no matter how hard i tried i tried to use it several times , but i finally gave up and threw it away
5	it 's hard to give an objective review of a perfume every person has different likes and dislikes when it comes to fragrances what i can say is this is a delicate , not overpowering fragrance with citrus and floral notes my wife was asked on two occasions what she was wearing and that the frangrance was very nice she normally likes but finds this one to be good for more than just casual wear and liked by almost everyone who notices it i would recommend it
3	i think this is a bit overpriced as the corresponding cologne is n't that long lasting , and at 20 for a stick of deodorant you really do n't need it the spray alone would be fine to coat your in fragrance the deodorant is a bit sticky and has a bit of an smell , not as clean smelling as the cologne it 's not bad , but i do think it 's worth the price
5	black pool is another great cnd shellac product it is a true black needs two coats to cover completely , but after two , it is a true black and non transparent goes on thin and smooth and does not bubble looks amazing with glitter or as a french tip
4	dermablend quick fix concealer is a very smooth silky feeling product that glides on with no dry feeling , no pulling of undereye skin , no pilling , and no in color it goes on evenly and stays throughout the day on the face i do n't know how well it would wear on other areas if one were to sweat the tube is handy to toss in your purse or leave on the bathroom countertop it looks like a thin lipstick tube although a little longer the product comes out of the tube the same way a lipstick comes out by turning the bottom until you have a small amount out it 's easy to apply either directly or by applying with clean fingers this is a good concealer it does very well at hiding dark circles as well as skin that 's slightly pigmented , or dark spots i recommend this concealer to anyone looking for something smooth and velvety that 's not at all drying , does n't irritate , and is true to the color on the amazon chart
3	essie always comes out with the best colors and this was no exception the only thing i did not like about this nail polish is that you have to paint your nails white before you use this color or else it looks awful
2	i was hesitant to try this product due to the reviews of it causing breakouts and blotchiness but i gave it a go happily i did not break out but i did not see results either it made the fine lines under my eyes stand out more it felt greasy and sticky i do n't like the smell either i do not wear foundation and this product just made my skin look shiny i did like the packaging the pump is nice but it is not something i would purchase
2	the pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails , no matter how many coats you put on i mixed it with a white polish , which helped , but you should n't have to do that do n't expect a solid color
5	the best ! natural color , not too much shimmer , applies wet or dry
5	great color !
5	good stuff , but strong , have to use alone with my night cream , mix it together in the palm and apply to face , but not every night , maybe few time a week only , for me my skin already sensitive , do n't want get burns
3	i ordered my first can of toppick hair building fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users i agree that this is a good product it 's not great , it does n't make me suddenly look like i have lots of hair , but i must say that it is better than the hair i naturally have now apparently due to aging , my once very thick hair has thinned in the past ten years , and i have tried many , many products in an effort to either regrow hair , or to give the illusion of more hair toppick is applied after shampooing , drying and styling , and on top of any other hair thickening products it is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can toppick is sold in several different color shades and light brown is the first shade that i tried , as i have light brown hair with blond highlights , neither of which are my natural shade after the first few shakes , i discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders , shirt and the bathroom than on my head i invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and i urge anyone who is interested in trying toppick , to do the same the nozzle tip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product the major plusses of toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and i find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair the minuses include 1 i need to use a lot of toppick to achieve the desired results , making this product more expensive than i thought it would be 2 i need to use a special spray to get the fibers to stick in place , adding another expense 3 any time i comb or fix my hair during the day , the toppick fibers come out , so i need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home and 4 the powder texture dulls the look of my hair since the minuses are greater than the plusses , for me , i gave the toppick hair building fibers , light brown , only 3 stars will i continue to use this product \? absolutely i have n't found anything else that hides my naked scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the toppick fibers will i continue to use rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products \? absolutely at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair , or my vanity if you are a mature woman and your has been reduced to just a few strands , i would highly recommend that you give toppick a try , just do n't make your too high
5	i have never used oils of any kind on my face so i was very curious about this i have always been taught that the idea was to keep oils off my face oils clog pores yes \? however , that was extremely short i love how this cleansing oil leaves my face feeling all soft and clean my skin feels amazing i know better than to touch , hard not to this is also an extremely effective makeup remover my only makeup is generally mascara which sometimes feels like shoe polish coming off this product removed mascara without scrubbing and that may cause me to wear makeup more often maybe not
5	this stuff works unfortunately , expensive
5	very moisturizing ! i transferred this to a spray bottle and spritz on my face after applying essence it 's refreshing and preps my skin for additional moisture later , like with a face oil or moisturizer
5	exactly as expected
4	my hair is fine and has a little unruly wave to it when left to it 's own devices the super smoother electric hair straightening brush did a good job of getting out the curl and wave easily and quickly i loved how easy it was to use it did n't give me the pin straight look that i can achieve with a regular straightening iron but overall , i was impressed by the ease for casual , straight looks in a hurry , the straightening brush was fabulous
5	love the color
5	talk about scrub ! yes stuff but that 's what it is for prep before shaving and deep clean ! i will repurchase
4	i had another bottle of this shade from a couple of years ago , and this shade was not exactly the same
1	it chip my wife nails in a day if you have a nail gel nail dryer \? then stick with or go with the gel nail polish it last longer than this stuff
3	this is pretty expensive it is good , but not great i switched to bliss oxygen which is cheaper and seems to work better for dry skin
4	boy does this perfume take me right back to the mid 90s when i was a and scents like ck one and clinique happy were oh so popular this is a very similarly scented spray that has an aquatic or ozonic base it is not the most natural scent , and organic elements are not strong , this combination has a synthetic aspect to it however , that wo n't turn everyone off in fact , for like myself it is quite appealing and takes me back to shopping a mall in the bottle is very attractive and fresh , a good representation of what scent is carried inside it resembles a water cooler or tank and stands upside down in its cap the scent does not have the longevity i 'd hoped for it is certainly a unisex scent , however , it will wear better on women or youthful men , in my opinion this scent would be a turn off on my 32 year old husband , i think i 'd feel like , grow up , already but my husband loves it on me ! and i think any teenager could pull it off well
5	perfect for fall ! it 's a nice grey with just a little bit of shimmer in it i liked it so much , i bought one for a friend too
5	i love the quality of mustela products and this does not disappoint this is light refreshing and has the wonderful mustela scent i love this so much i will even sprayed some on my own face for a refresher while out of town this makes my children 's face and her feel hydrated and smells great
5	great cologne long lasting smells great , like a quality cologne clean , fresh , classy , and masculine
5	this is a high end luxury brush that truly delivers there are two things you need to know when you 're ready to buy a mason pearson brush of any sort one is the size full size \( the largest size \) , handy \( medium sized \) , or pocket \( the smallest size \) this is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept \( say , in your handbag \) , but because of the bristle length of the various sizes the smaller sizes have shorter bristles the bristles have to be able to reach your scalp , and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair if you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair , you 'd do better with a larger size the other consideration is the bristle type do you want all nylon , like this detangler \? even though the detangler is all nylon , some of the bristles are longer and some are shorter , just like the mixed bristle brush it 's hard to see in the picture you should know that the detangler is the only mason pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair all of the larger mason pearson brushes , including this one , come with a bristle brush , so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush the detangler is a brush just like the other brushes , not something just to be used when your hair is tangled or your done shampooing it is a fantastic brush for people with coarse hair or long hair or thick hair also even though my hair is very short , it is the only brush that works for me because my hair is so thick this handy size is about eight inches long it 's quite a large expense to buy any mason pearson product compared to other manufacturers of hair care items it 's a luxury item and the purchase is an investment but it 's worth it if you 're the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie , then you can justify the cost that 's how we did it \) for additional information on mason pearson visit their web site at masonpearson dot com highly recommended
3	contains cotton flakes not for me i guess i do n't have oily skin
5	another beautiful color , i am loving this
5	great product , great price , fast shipping !
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	face it if you ca n't build a set of nails with envy , you probably are n't intended to wear nail polish this stuff works i started using this ten years ago and paid full price when i found it here , on amazon , all my troubles faded to black sometimes i admit i stray from this terrific product and return to hard as nails trying to fool myself into then my nails grow and i begin to suffer again keep it up with envy , girls and you 'll never be sorry you 'll be the one everyone else
1	would love to know how this product works but ca n't even get it out of the bottle there 's an that you are supposed to line up with on for open and off for closed that did n't work tried the with off in case the bottle was assembled wrong that did n't work either went online and asked if anyone else had a problem with the bottle another user with the same issue said to try turning the top only half way that did n't work my husband tried using force and eventually got the product to squirt out all over the counter , breaking the twist cap , or so we thought i tried squeezing the bottle , but no matter which way i turned the top i could n't get the product to come out after thing for several more minutes , i just gave up then , 2 drops out on the counter i dabbed those on my face and the stamp size area did feel soft and smooth but when i tried to get more product out of the bottle , it stopped working yet again i give up !
5	i 've been a fan of mario badescu products for years , but mostly for preventing acne now that i'm older , i need to use moisturizing products i'm happy to say that the herbal hydrating serum has no scent it 's a gel serum that makes your face feel cool and smooth this is a 1 oz bottle , but you only need a tiny amount to use i used it over my moisturizer , but you can use it alone too i'm impressed with this serum recommended
5	with the exception of anthony 's shaving cream and night moisturizer , jack black was the only product i was using for skin care i decided to try this for my night moisturizer when i saw it on amazon and like their other products i love it a lot better than for a night time moisturizer i use the black jack facial wash to clean my face at night followed by their protein serum and then the dry erase cream and have noticed a difference since switching brands i would recommend this product for any man that cares about their skin
4	i 've been hearing that elta 's products are the hg of sunscreen for years so , i 've finally got around to trying it the texture is thick ish it does leave a white residue on my olive skin \( this is why it loses a point \) if i put some elbow grease behind it , the white cast mostly dissipates my skin is normal and this product makes me feel like i have a primer on my face i do n't wear foundation but i imagine this product would work well underneath it
3	it 's a pretty color if you have the time and patience to apply 3 4 coats even after 3 coats you could still see my nail line
5	this is my go to ! i use the all the time and it is great ! i have a fancy blow dryer and straightener , and this is just great for a curling iron i have think hair and use about 330 degrees i over the cord once when it was in a storage holder and about broke my neck and it bent the connector from the handle to the barrel i bent it back and went about my life and never had an issue !
2	i was expecting something better for the price and the hype i thought it would leave my lips super moisturized , maybe looking healthier , more plump nothing ! it was heavy and sticky
1	no idea how this stuff got so many rave reviews seriously i'm very fair completed and it looks like crap maybe if you already have some color it looks ok , but otherwise , it 's orangish and does n't cover well at all just makes my legs look orange tinted , especially out in the sun so disappointed would n't recommend this at all
3	these are good colors , they go on smoothly and softly without tugging they just do n't last the way i'm accustomed to \( smashbox and kat von d being my favorites \) they fade noticeably and crease within a few hours of application they are easy to apply however they also have a reddish undertone that is not a friend to rosy skin this really made the pink red tones in my face stand out
4	my husband used this first instead of using a little , he took a fairly good amount of this \( over a teaspoon \) and his thinning hair looked slicked down and on a helmet head look nothing moved he could have been stuck smack dab in the middle of a and that hair would n't have one bit i did n't want to touch it i used this this morning on my damp hair it has very little scent and what is there quickly dissipates i dabbed the tips of my fingers of one hand in the jar and removed a small amount i rubbed it in my palms and just sort of ran it through my hair and then combed my hair i was going for a slicked back look for the beach today my hair stayed in place , but being very fine and silky it seemed to have more texture while it looked shinier \( my hair is a medium ash blonde \) , it did n't look greasy or i actually like the way it looks and holds my only advice is go easy when using this it takes a very small amount to get results
4	love the color
4	works far better than any mousse i 'd used previously really great for giving body and fullness to my baby fine hair i generally do n't like the feel of in my hair , and this product is no exception , but well worth when i want my hair to look its best
5	as most women know , there are at least three steps to a skincare regime mixing and matching or using just one as a stand alone product wo n't give you full benefit of a skincare product , since they are formulated to work with used during another step of the routine with that in mind , in order to evaluate this product properly , i either purchased or requested through vine , the other pieces \( please see my review of the toner and radiant moisturizer in this meg 21 line \) i then used all three products faithfully twice a day , every day for 30 days i can tell you it works your results may vary \( after my testing period i tended to on the twice daily routine \) what i liked about this cleanser was that it was smooth and creamy without being overly oily feeling or heavily scented it has a very faint scent , and the pump bottle is designed for easy use without contaminating the product it cleaned thoroughly without making my skin feel tight and rinsed off easily , it left no residue behind i avoided my eye area , but did n't encounter any irritating if it got on my lids while i rinsed i highly recommend this
5	as promised and great transaction
5	another great luxury beauty product from jane iredale
5	this eau de parfum presents the wearer with a host of it is light and airy for daytime , yet salty , spicy , and sensual enough for evening it really is unusual and not like the other scents out there a great combination of sandalwood , musk , salt , pepper , and flowers ! even the bottle is unique and complex kind of reminiscent of one of those children 's folded paper the presentation package is great this would be a wonderful gift like an interesting wine , this perfume is a bit of a musky , salty , sweet , spicy all at the same time neither heavy nor cloying , this scent leaves a nice cloud of mystery in its wake the scent lasts a while , but is clean , crisp and not over powering highly recommended for that unique individual
5	perfect in every way perfect color and love the tingly feel
3	i 've only been using this for a week , and , while i like the texture of it , it has started to irritate my skin for the last couple of years , i 've been using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href eltamd uv clear spf 46 48 gram 1 7 oz dp b002msn3qq ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 eltamd uv clear spf 46 , 48 gram 1 7 oz a nbsp as my daily sunscreen since it works so well under makeup , and think i 'll go back to that a strength of this is that it goes on very thin and light , almost like a serum it also does n't irritate or burn my sensitive skin immediate upon application , as some products do it does , however , begin to dry out my skin as the day goes on i always check beauty products on the paula 's choice website , and , while she does n't review this exact product , she does review its predecessor , which has almost the exact same ingredients here are her comments about it that 's because it contains a high amount of the b vitamin niacinamide , which research has shown can improve excess melanin \( skin pigment \) production , lessening and potentially eliminating dark spots the issue is that for many , treating dark spots takes more than one ingredient to that end , la roche posay included resorcinol , an ingredient that has some research showing it can help lighten dark spots ! that 's exciting , but we 're skeptical the amount this serum contains is enough to kick in that benefit even if you wanted to bank on the niacinamide alone , we would n't advise it due to the amount of alcohol this fragranced serum contains it 's the fourth ingredient , and in this position is likely to cause some amount of irritation that no one 's skin needs in this version , alcohol is actually the third ingredient , so its potential to irritate is even higher it 's no wonder that some reviewers have experienced dry skin i have dark spots on my face just from sun exposure over the years so far , this has n't done much to fade them , but i will update this if i use this more
2	is clinical hydra cool serum , 1 fl oz is supposed to rejuvenate , hydrate and soothe skin it supposedly contains super antioxidants , botanicals and bio nutrients to give a fair review , i 've been using this trial sample size for a few weeks i can honestly say , i do n't see any difference in my skin at all after shaving , it does cool irritated skin a little , but not enough to warrant the cost as for my skin with antioxidants and nutrients , if there are any it 's not enough to make a noticeable difference in my skin fine wrinkles are still here my skin is not any more soft or supple from any moisturizing effect i just do n't see any difference in my skin with this product , other than it cools shaved skin a bit , but i can always use an inexpensive aloe product for that
5	bioelements is by far the best skin care line i have come across i use a few of the products shipping was pretty quick from this seller
5	i never wear colors to work other than light pinks in different shades school rules , but i just could n't resist this for when i'm not teaching it 's a beautiful shade of mint green , but still just a bit much for me i'm going to lighten it a bit with some opi alpine snow nail lacquer and the lighter shade will be perfect again , beautiful color , but not me i simply need a lighter shade , all a matter of personal preference
4	good product
4	i liked it but its not hg i like that its glycerin based which is different i do n't really like the feel of it on my lips or skin kind of a waxy silicone feel but it does moisturize well overall consensus is that it 's way too expensive in america and therefore even though i put i would repurchase , i would only do so for the original price oh yes and the smell disappears quickly as stated
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i used this for legs and arm pits and was very , very happy with the smooth feeling and also the nice scent this is a very rich , soft cream that you do n't need a whole lot of to get a smooth shave very nice product
5	enjoy this color
5	i'm very much a fragrance addict i have dozens of bottles of cologne and perfume that i mix or save for certain occasions part of why i like to mix my scents is because i'm rarely 100 satisfied perfume these days tend to be either too sugary and sweet or too old fashioned and flowery adding a musky cologne can tone down an overbearing perfume and , , a hint of sweet perfume can make a cologne less intimidating the reason that i have chosen to give 5 stars is because i feel like it is pretty much perfect as is there is a darkness that lingers just underneath the floral overtones that is the perfect combination of and nice i like that they describe the as because there are some notes of bitter grapes the floral aspects are indeed sensual , but in a youthful modern way it 's very much a strong , powerful fragrance it 's not something i would wear to the club it smells too important for and my only warning is that you should not overuse this fragrance a little goes a long way too much will have a effect that will be counterproductive to the that makes it work so well the bottle is simplistic , but perfect this fragrance does n't have a gimmick or celebrity , it 's just classy the dark , purplish blue color of the bottle is an excellent representation of the scent in a hue overall to be honest , some of lacoste 's fragrances have left me underwhelmed this one , however , is worth trying it does n't try to to a youthful audience but it does n't repeat the same problems of 99 of the floral fragrances that are on the market i love the darkness mixed with sweetness highly recommended ! !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	i love essie because of it 's staying power it lasts for more than one week and this color was rockin' i received many compliments on the color
5	great product
3	this sponge applicator has nice pressure and length for general use , it 's not that much more versatile than concealer brush or using a q tip or your fingers , and it 's harder to clean than any of those it 's hard to justify why it costs a lot more than even a good brush , though it 's especially suited for under the eyes for the delicate skin in this area , a brush might be too rough , but a cotton pad or q tip , and yes , clean fingers , all work there too , although this brush will offer more control as well as softness if you strongly prefer the foam texture and density and desire the greater control that this offers , it is a nice tool , but it 's also expensive
1	the main selling point of this shampoo was that it was volumizing shampoo for myself i found this shampoo had no noticeable effect on volumizing on that alone i think it 's a fail but the other problem is the packaging the bottle is made out of metal this is a problem if it happens to fall on a surface that might chip or your toes you also ca n't squeeze the bottle so the shampoo has to be a somewhat runny consistency the smell is very neutral , a minor hint of generic soap scent i ca n't recommend this based on the volumizing claim maybe others will have better luck with it
5	updated review 12 7 14 i said below that i had n't noticed any difference in the lines between my eyes well , that has changed the lines are definitely reduced i'm shocked and amazed and have fallen in love highly recommend you try this now that i'm older i 've discovered that i can indeed have dry skin that after decades of battling oil , i now have to worry about chapped skin and skin that is badly in need of hydration one of the problems i have in finding solutions is that i have very sensitive skin \( with lots of allergies \) and i have skin that can still have a breakout problem if i use something excessively greasy so i was interested in trying out this one thing i liked was the ingredients nothing that i could find that you could n't buy in the eu with it 's higher requirements the next thing i discovered was that this booster oil did n't cause any allergic reaction i tried it on the inside of my elbow and wrist first , then on my neck and finally on my face all good i am using the booster oil by itself and in conjunction with the two creams i use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href l oreal paris revitalift cheap dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 l'oreal paris revitalift \( cheap \) a nbsp and nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href l occitane immortelle divine cream expensive dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 l'occitane immortelle divine cream \( expensive \) a results i 've hit the lines between my brows with the booster oil by itself , and later with a combination of the booster oil and creams and i 've noticed no difference if this changes , i 'll report i 've used the booster oil to supplement my creams and i be gosh darned if it has n't improved the look of my skin i have n't noticed changes to the micro creases i have , but my skin looks smoother both in the less irritated sense , and in the more uniform complexion sense summary one thing i 've noticed is that prices can change after the first rounds of reviews come out , so i wo n't comment on price it could change i like this booster oil it actually does n't take much to enhance the effectiveness of other creams cremes , and it did n't irritate my skin i know other people have said that it absorbs right in that 's not been my experience it 's an oil , it acts like it but it 's not greasy and if you do n't overdo it , you wo n't shine for long i did experience an improvement in the tone of my complexion
4	so ar soo good it is really made for oily skin it dries my already dry skin out too much , but my partner with a more oily face absolutely loves it its only been 5 days of use so far so have n't seen any skin rejuvenation magic yet but it did help clean up what looked to be a breakout starting it smells pleasant botanical smell skin is left feeling soft and a little tighter all in all a nice product if you do n't mind oil cutting properties it bubbles exceptionally light and fluffy so i think 4oz will stretch a little ways still awfully pricey if it doesnt start showing some really great results !
4	delightful ! this is a gently scented floral body lotion it absorbs quickly when applied and massaged into the skin my trouble spots are my lower arms \( too much sun exposure \) and my legs \( which get very dry during winter \) i 've been a crabtree evelyn buyer for many years and particularly like their hand and body lotions and creams this moisture rich lotion left my skin soft and supple and smooth looking immediately upon application i would definitely recommend this product to anyone needing dry skin relief
4	when i ordered this mask , i did n't realize it was a men 's facial mask i tried it anyway and i liked it for reference , i have combination skin , that has larger pores in the t zone and i get dry skin outside the t zone this mask worked great for my skin type i need to do a cleansing drawing mask at least once or twice a month this really made the pores on the sides of my nose look smaller it just made my face feel cleaner too i also liked the sea type of scent , it was a masculine scent , just a fresh , sea mineral , type of scent i left it on longer than it called for , but , it did n't seem to strip my skin of all moisture overall , i 'd definitely repurchase this and use again , though , i did knock a star off because of price \( i'm cheap ! \) it did n't break me out and it did great for reducing the look of pores on my nose
5	i am obsessed with zoya nail polish as a long time opi and essie polish lover , i came across zoya through pinterest was my first color used and it is a beautiful color i find the polish to last as long as the competitors , if not an extra day \( though that could be because i'm trying a different base coat \) i also find that zoya is not as thick as the others and i find it easier to manage
4	i really do like this cleanser it removes make up well and feels great on the skin if it were less expensive , i would make it my regular cleanser however , i do find it to be a little too costly i do n't know that it necessarily does a better job than many less expensive cleansers too bad , because it is very nice
5	this is a great product it has kept my skin smooth and acne free for almost two years now
4	good moisturizer took a star off because it has a strange \( to me \) , almost urine like smell
5	love it
5	meg 21 cell therapy anti oxidant boost serum makes many claims and provides some science to such things as reduces fine lines i am not an expert on skin care products , but can provide some personal background on my own experiences with other products along with meg 21 cell therapy growing up in florida , and having a parent that had sun related melanoma , i have understood the importance of sun screen for years , and routinely use it later in life , i moved to colder and drier climates and wanted a daily use unscented sunscreen moisturizer not just for sun protection but to reduce dry itchy have used some form of p olay complete for sensitive skin since \( aged 20 years \) \( the name and formulation have changed a couple of times , but performance as a daily sunscreen moisturizer has remained constant \) now in my 50s , i still use olay complete \( with occasional into total effects anti aging moisturizer depending on price \) , but nothing stops the of time , particularly around the eyes fine wrinkles are normal , and i have them i have tried a number of products that to reduce or minimize these wrinkles again , not being a skin care expert , my own estimation of the range of products making claims generally fall in to a couple of categories covering agents \( including colored pigments , fillers , and reflecting agents \) , and tightening agents \( various alcohols , witch hazel , astringents \) , \( botox ! \) , chemical and mechanical exfoliants \( retin a , retinol , organic acids , alpha beta hydroxyl acids , , micro beads and scrubs , laser peels \) , and \( collagen injections , moisture , and purported collagen and external \) with the exception of anything injected \( collagen , botox \) , face lifts and anything laser i have tried all of these topical products at one point or another certain products i avoid putting on my face since they seem to make my skin sensitive and irritated \( notably olay body moisture , with or without the sure why and the obvious mechanical scrubbing agents containing micro beads \) cutting to the , i prefer scent free a scent that is very light and disappears quickly no sticky residues after application is also important application cost must be under control , something can be expensive as long as you do not have to slather it on ! so , in addition to daily olay complete , my preference for around the eyes and over time has been limited to another olay product , , which is now called olay eyes illuminating eye cream this product has some reflecting pigments which brighten darker skin under the eyes , along with a refreshing hydration agent in the 80s clinique had a serum product that must be similar to their current all about eyes that i liked \( \? \) and seemingly compared very well with the meg 21 cell therapy in a couple of key characteristics enough about other products , what about meg 21 \? well , first off , product cost and printed science on the label should make it superior to all others \? there are things to love a very light almost imperceptible scent that reminds me of the prior clinique product a slight pine citrus scent that disappears quickly a small amount around your eyes dries quickly with no stickiness and no residue , along with a very pleasant refreshing cooling effect that lasts during the same drying tired eyes will love it over a couple of days of suggested twice daily use , some apparent wrinkle reduction was present under certain lighting perceived as tightening rather than hiding , filling , or reflection now it remains to be seen if that wrinkle reduction was due to reducing glycation or other large marketing ideas about toxic sugars \( which , frankly , as a chemist , i consider jumbo \) if glycation is reduced the wrinkle reduction would be expected to be a longer lasting effect \? personally , having used sunscreen all my life , aging is normal and while can be slowed it cannot be with the topical application of a cream \? all that aside , and most , wrinkles seem reduced when meg 21 is present and i like the way it feels when i put it on now the in the room application cost is low with just small dabs used around the eyes , but there is initial sticker shock at almost a hundred dollars an ounce \( what is that in cost per lb \? ! \) but if you are in the market for these higher end products , it is not out of the cost about the same i do love meg 21 for its low scent , , quick drying , and no residue or some subjective wrinkle reduction and refreshing feeling when applied given an opportunity i would try some other meg 21 products !
3	i sprayed my face \( closing my eyes , exposing my eyelids \) and my skin feels ok , not amazing or anything after a few days my eyelids started to sting , feel very dry , very uncomfortable i realized my eyelids were having some sort of allergic reaction to the spray , but the rest of my face was fine now i just wear sunglasses every time i spray this on my face , i do n't want the product to go to waste haha
5	this is a great set for those of us not too familiar with contouring as the limit of shades keeps it simple i still need to practice a bit , but so far i'm very happy using the two lighter shades primarily with just a touch of the darker one as with other bliss products , i happily report no irritation
1	very cheap nail polish it chips very easily
3	i guess 3 out of 5 is not bad , but it 's not enough to me to buy this set again i might , however , buy a few of the items separately the products are made of good ingredients , most of them natural and organic organic fruit acid complex , peptides , dmae , alpha lipoic acid , vitamin c and coq10 are some of the ingredients and you will not find parabens , petroleum , propylene or butylene glycol , sodium lauryl sulfates , pesticides , phthalates , artificial dyes or fragrances and the products are not tested on animals all this is a big plus in beauty products now as to what 's in this kit 1 \) 2 oz green apple cleansing gel this is a very runny gel so you must be careful when squeezing the tube not to get out too much or have it run away from you as for its effectiveness , it seems to work ok it has a foaming action and the skin feels clean after use , but mine also feels a bit dry but then , that 's why there are moisturizers 2 \) 5 oz green apple peel , full strength another ok product apply to your face and leave on for 10 minutes , rinse off , and there is a definite exfoliation effect without excessive harshness as with the cleaning gel , i also found this to be a bit drying 3 \) 25 oz green apple age defy serum this is also ok but , unlike some other serums i have used on my skin , this one dries my skin somewhat again , there are moisturizers included in the kit so no big deal however , the moisturizers included here are the two products of the kit that i do not like 4 \) 5 oz green apple spf15 moisturizer this is for day use it moisturizes and protects \( somewhat \) from the sun 5 \) 5 oz green apple age defy moisturizer no sun protection this is for your nighttime moisturizing treatment of the 5 products listed above , the two i did not care for are the moisturizers they left my skin feeling like it could n't breathe properly , and that was even when i used just a small amount i am used to clear serums and oils , such as rosehips seed oil , and like the way those moisturize and absorb into the skin much better than these two green apple products do so my bottom line opinion is that this kit is not a necessary addition to my bathroom cabinet i'm happy enough with the peel but am just as happy with a good scrub product and as for the moisturizers here , they 're a no , thank you , i have my own favorites already however , a juice beauty product that i am especially happy with but not included in this kit is their nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href juice beauty stem cellular repair eye treatment 0 5 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 juice beauty stem cellular repair eye treatment , 0 5 fl oz a that has a definite place of honor in my cabinet
4	the best way to keep it from chipping , or peeling off , is first use mild polish remover on nails to get any oil or dirt off \( i have also been told to rough up the nails every other week \( use a buff bar and use the even out side but do not push hard or do for to long \) after i use the remover and let the nails dry , i use a good base coat , one that helps hold the polish i let the base dry for 10 min 's or so , then put on 1 thin coat and let it dry 's or more then put on second thin coat of the polish after 20 min 's i put on a good top coat , which protects the polish , gives a nice shine and takes away that sand paper feel you need to put on coats and let it dry longer between coats when using glitter polish also it helps to use 100 acetone remover , got mine at walmart , to make it then or even normal acetone polish remover also , you can use a thin coat of colored polish after the base coat and under the glitter to give a little more depth with this glitter you can use almost any shade such as bronze , red , blue , purple , etc use light , dark or anything in between for opi also makes some nice glitters
5	this is my second time ordering this lip balm only this time i bought 3 i absolutely love the minty tingling sensation and hydrates my lips ! what 's really amazing is that the merchant shipped the product to me fast ! ! it was n't due to arrive until wednesday but today \( \) i was wishing that i had more of this lip balm in my tube because my lips were hurting bad ! then i heard the ring and there it was at my door step ! ! now my lips feel better ! i use this lip balm at night too before going to bed it keeps my lips moisturized throughout the night ! thank you for shipping it out so fast ! ! !
5	nice alcohol free soothing wipes for sensitive skin i like the easy open and re dispenser great wipes to keep on hand for quick and soothing clean ups
4	buying a perfume for someone is always tricky , what might seem good to you might not work for the other person this perfume though is of the subtle kind and has a very nice fruity floral smell to it it 's not strong so that way it wo n't be an olfactory nuisance to anyone and wears off soon so you do n't have to worry too much about it it comes in a simple package and the bottle is very nice as you can imagine , it 's for the ladies and the pink touch goes a long way to that the smell also the same and is the type that will be enjoyed by most ladies it 's a bit pricy for about 100 ml but overall you do get a quality product
4	anything with the borghese name on it is quality i bought this just to try because i liked the ingredient list works well i mix it with other serums i put on my face and neck it is light enough to do so works well not a miracle in a bottle but there is nothing like that available not sure if i will repurchase or not still have 1 2 bottle left
5	great brand and great color !
5	i love the consistency of juice beauty , it 's a gel that stays put and does n't end up in my eyes like many eye products do that 's important for me since i wear contact lenses at times it stays put under makeup and does n't cause my eye makeup to migrate \( resulting in raccoon eyes \) the way other eye products do it has a lovely light gel feeling that seems to firm up the skin under the eyes , diffusing fine lines and wrinkles the thing i really love about this product is that it 's fragrance free i can never understand why cosmetic companies feel the need to put fragrance in a product that 's being applied around the eyes but many do ! this one does n't , it is very appropriate for sensitive skin , and has wonderful clean ingredient list as well i am new to juice beauty , but i plan on investing in more of their products when i need to replenish my kit highly recommended !
4	gentle hydrating , this moisturizer is creamy \( not at all oily \) and absorbs quickly it really does improve the appearance of the fine lines around my eyes rather than being in a tube , this eye cream comes in a pump one pump dispenses a little more than i need for both eyes i use the excess above my lips to help minimize the lines that come with age i am able to apply makeup soon after applying the cream and do n't have any problems with eye shadow on my lid this eye cream helps with the fine lines around my eyes gives my eyes a more youthful look \( i'm a senior citizen \)
3	the color looks just as good on as it does in the bottle \( if you use a super shiny topcoat \) , but the formula is pretty awful it went on super gloopy and dried extremely fast making it hard to work with and despite my buffer , base coat , and seche vite top coat , the polish chipped the next day it reminds me of butler please gorgeous color , but do n't expect it to last more than one day on your nails
4	this color is n't as bright on , but nevertheless , i still like the green essie is slowly becoming my least favorite brand of nail polishes , simply because they seem watered down \( literally \) any essie color i use i almost always have to do three coats but what i can say about essie is that they have such a great array of colors ! they 're always so lush , vibrant , demure but yet sexy at the same time
5	i just discovered clarisonic , or at least i just finally decided to take the plunge and get one these are amazing these brushes take care of cleansing your skin whether you want a deep cleanse or if you have sensitive skin once you have these brushes , you 'll also probably want the one that blends your makeup foundation i love that one too
4	i like it i wish the others who claim to be 100 m oil were really like this one
3	being a woman of a certain age \( over 40 \) , i know the value of frequent moisturizing , especially at night lazlo 's phelityl night cream is a fairly good night cream , it goes on fairly heavy and it does do a very good job of moisturizing at night it comes with a spatula so you wo n't be putting fingers in it and causing undue contamination of the cream inside the jar that said , however , with a 115 price tag , i found that it was of no better quality nor does it give noticeably better results than any other night creams available at a fraction of the price i think i will save my money and buy something else that does n't cost nearly so much
5	i brought the with me on an trip which is not all that conducive to great skin care wind , rain and sun can to take its toll on my skin i took some time out to try this mask and i love it my skin feels and looks me smooth and more even in tone i have age related rough spots that were less obvious i enjoy it it seems to lessen my pore size but not in a way too tight manner i think i 'll get at least 5 applications from this jar i 'd definitely buy it again kind of a skin
5	long wearing and easy to apply formula love the essie line was not able to find in the local store fast shipping and brand new bottle
5	you do n't need to use much of this shampoo for it help you clean your hair yes , it is pricey , but well worth it
5	i 've used mario badescu skincare for about 10 years now love it and will never switch to anything else the product i 'd most brag about the vitamin c serum it keeps me looking much younger than i am and is the most effective product i 've ever tried for keeping my melasma at bay when i ran out of the last bottle the spots came back slowly but surely and much darker a true test of its efficiency i highly recommend all mb products they give you excellent results for a great price
5	pca skin hydrator plus spf 30 is my go to daily all year around i use the pca gentle exfoliate daily and follow up with the spf30 living in northern new england \( maine \) our weather is severe in the winter and can be brutally hot in the summer pca skin products have been the best for my sensitive skin no overbearing odor
5	bought as a gift for my husband after he completely ran out of all cologne \( even the old spice standby ! \) delivery was speedy and the package arrived well packed with the contents protected he \( and i \) love the scent and who does n't feel better when you know you smell gooood !
5	absolutely love this polish ! ! ! it stains the nails so be sure to use a good basecoat but love it !
5	love this product makes ones skin feel like velvet and it is moisturizing this is a recent find for me
3	i honestly ca n't say if this pillow case is helping the skin on my face , the very fine copper fibers are too small to notice but the pillowcase has a silky feel thats not un pleasant a standard pillow fits perfectly copper , an excellent conductor of heat , was thought to stimulate a warm flow of healing energy very little copper from copper peptide products penetrates the skin charged molecules , including copper and peptides , do not readily the skin barrier so i question how you benefit much from this pillowcase
5	great line of polishes with less toxicity pretty colors good wearability
5	love oribe ! smells wonderful and great hair product
5	love this nail polish and this color ! !
5	good product
5	this concealer works really well to even out the redness in my cheeks i apply it in dabs , then i take a highlighter brush and smooth it out after allowing it to dry , i apply my foundation my foundation applies easily over the top i am unable to see any redness through my foundation dermablend is a high quality brand i have used several of their products and have always been satisfied !
5	this color was a perfect match for my skin tone , and covered up imperfections with only a light application this stuff is amazing it 's a bit pricey , but it is used so lightly that it will go a very long way it left my skin looking fresh and smooth i will most definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to friends
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	i 've bought the smudge stick before and it 's an easy eye liner to use much easier than the smudge pot which requires more practice the stila kohl is nice too but smudges so much more than the stick and does n't make as narrow a line the purple is n't as harsh as black for those of us with pasty skin and again , does n't smudges if you rub your eyes or sweat a little both of which are inevitable with allergy season and summer heat
4	so far , of all the tanning solutions , sprays , creams , etc that i have tried i find this one works the best i get a nice , even realistic looking tan and the only orangish areas are on the parts of my body \( ankle bones , tops of my feet \) where i neglected to wipe the tanning mousse off so , overall it tans well and lasts me about a week before i notice it fading away i can even shave my legs and still keep my tan other reviewers have very well described in detail the application process \( which should be followed exactly for a positive result \) , so i wo n't waste mine or your time talking about it though the xen tan mousse is a bit pricey i think it delivers a good tan for the money i 've tried a lot of other tanning products and some worked well but others turned me orange or did n't last past the next shower this one seems to hold for a while which is good
4	this juice beauty stem cellular repair moisturizer was great it dispensed well \( from a bit of an odd pump on top \) , went on smooth , my skin just soaked it right in , and it left my face and neck feeling smooth and healthy it smells strongly of fresh lemon , more overpowering than i would have expected , but not unpleasant it definitely reminds one of organic and healthy although i ca n't really vouch yet for any stem cell repair i do n't have any hugely visible difference yet after a few days it seemed to cause kind of a mild acne outbreak though , which seemed to indicate that it was making my sensitive , normal dry skin \( with oily spots \) to clear and begin repairs this i actually liked because i can see where it 's likely to improvements not sure yet if the overall improvements will be worth the price on a regular basis but overall i really like the changes i'm beginning to see , so would recommend !
5	40 years old and still get mistaken for a 20 something i 'd say this works ! ! !
5	you can not go wrong with this company
5	my absolute fave nail polish color i'm dark skinned and it is beautiful on my nails
5	i have had a clarisonic mia for a year and i have really liked it it was recommended to me by a friend and by my brother in law 's wife , so i thought i 'd give it a shot it 's expensive , but it 's been really wonderful i realized that i was to change the brush at the rate you are supposed to \( it happened \) it 's important to change the brushes as they can build up bacteria which they will then spread around on your face when you wash i was very excited to have the opportunity to use the smart profile purely because of the brush changing , but this one is so much more it is timed for the different parts of your face , so you 'll start it on your forehead for 20 seconds , it will buzz and you 'll change to your chin for 20 seconds and then it and turns down the intensity for your cheeks \( 10 seconds each \) i find this feature extremely handy i also used the body brush the smart profile knows which brush is on , so it does n't time itself for the body you can use it on the normal level or you can switch it turbo for some extra exfoliation it came with a sample of body scrub and a cleaner i have very sensitive skin which reacts badly to changes in skin care products , so i did n't try the cleaner , but i did try the body scrub and it was nice , but you 'd be fine with any exfoliating or non exfoliating body scrub while this is a pricey product , if you like your current clairsonic product , you will really love the extra features on this one
5	good product feels great on scalp and goes a long way i have hair down to mid thigh and a little goes a long way
5	ordered this as a gift for a friend who is in love with this particular fragrance she practically bathes in perfume so i had to get her the large version
5	it smells pleasant and works sometimes i leave it on my face for 10 15 minutes and take it off , like a mask leaves my face very clean does not work on blackheads though
5	very good
1	the uslu airlines nail polish is a new nail polish that applies in a matte finish and then it cracks to give you a brick like finish i did n't like the way that this nail polish looks on my nails the polish applies easy but if you do n't like cracked and matted nail polish you will not like this beautiful bottle and a cute name \( whack is crack \) but i did n't like the way that this nail looked and the texture is not good at all but maybe if you are into that type of polish you will like it
5	pretty , pretty , pretty ! i get compliments on it all the time
5	my frizzy , dry , frizzy hair needs all the help it can get ! chi has been a go to product line silk infusion keeps the frizz away without weighing down my fine hair and giving it a nice shine careful how much you use as a little goes a long way i put it on damp freshly washed and conditioned hair and then blow dry and style as usual very , very pleased with the results especially with the hit humid months of summer on the way
5	ok
5	great moisturizer ! you do not need a large amount of the product to cover the entire face mario got this one right after application , my face feels smooth and never flakes or gets dry !
3	pros the product itself is terrific it 's got a great antioxidant \( vitamin c \) which has been proven to build cell regeneration in aging skin , combined with ingredients that block both uva and uvb rays \( the rays that will sunburn you and the rays that will age you \) and it goes on with a smooth , matte finish that i 've never seen in drugstore brands , or any brand that costs less than 25 it 's probably at least in the top 3 sunscreens i 've ever used cons that cost i got it for free because i'm a vine voice i ca n't imagine shelling out 72 for such a small quantity on a related \( downside \) note , the packaging is this tiny pump that only pumps out a little at a time to get the necessary coverage on my face because sunscreen is not the thing you want to on i need to pump this sucker a good 8 9 times that tries my patience , and , if you 're someone who is n't familiar with the science behind sunscreen and the necessity of making sure you really cover your face , is going to lead to coverage and what 's the point of blocking uva uvb rays if you do n't actually put enough on \? so , at the very least , i think they need to change the packaging to encourage women to get the sun care they actually need i 'd give the product itself 5 stars easy , but that bad packaging requires a few star knock so , 3 stars
3	i am not a fan of the texture of this product the almond pieces are actually too large and feel separate from the creamy product ! i ca n't tell if the product really works , because i feel the pieces scratch my face
5	great for your skin very refreshing and has a great smell to it
5	fills in those thin spots nicely great for men or women
5	my first experience with juice beauty moisturizer has been positive the consistency of the cream is smooth and the fragrance is so light i do not smell it unless sticking my nose in the jar the certified organic seal and the cruelty free builds my confidence in the company 's products apply the moisturizer and blend into skin as directed otherwise it will take a few minutes to soak in dermatologists recommend using a sun screen separate from beauty products to make sure that you apply enough sun screen so the fact that this has no sunscreen is a plus , i use a separate beauty the moisturizer is recommended for over age 20 and i am well beyond 20 it is still too soon to tell if this reduces wrinkles so watch this space for an update
4	i love this cleanser \( and the whole blemish clearing line \) a lot it does n't leave a film , it cleans well , and it does a lot of good with my acne \( which i 've just started to get in my 30 's \) the kit that comes with a smaller one of these , the lotion and the peel is a great deal as well i like the bigger bottle though , since i 've been trying to wash my face every day to clear up the acne i 've gotten this year seems to be helping
5	i personally have very hooded eyes , and normal curlers just do not reach my short eyelashes this is definitely the only curler i have found that works on hooded eyes and short lashes it also holds up very well however , i have contacted the website twice about pad replacements , and they never send them to me so that 's kind of a bummer
2	i just used it for the first time it took a long time to heat up and only one panel worked initially i do n't know if it is defective or not
5	amazing i love it
5	great prep for shellac when used as directed , it does the job ! i use it even before regular polish applications
5	oh wonderful lipgloss the color is perfect for fair skin and it 's not so thin it comes off immediately but not so thick that it feels overwhelming really pretty color and nice compact tube
5	great
5	great product !
2	per the wife i bought this at nordstrom \( same price \) i do n't like the applicator \( the brush is not easy to use and it is more difficult to control how much product comes out i am pretty sure that i am using it at twice the rate of the regular gel , and it is three times the price \) this gel dries out substantially faster than the regular gel in my opinion , making it more difficult to use i have not noticed any difference in terms of this gold firming gel , and at this price , i am not buying it again stick with the regular gel , which is less expensive and does the job
5	unique technology which transforms cream to water massage a small amount of cream onto your cleansed face neck for about 30 seconds this allows the micro droplets to moisturize your skin lock in hydration i really do n't understand how this cream works , but it works great for me it leaves my skin moisturized for hours all day long it does not leave my skin feeling oily as a matter of fact , after the bliss fabulous drench and quench cream is absorbed , i ca n't feel it on my skin , but i can see the effects of it this is a great moisturizer that does n't leave my skin feeling oily it 's lightweight , quickly absorbed leaves my skin hydrated for hours it has a clean , fresh , mild fragrance that does n't linger
3	i 've been using for about 3 weeks now and i have not noticed any difference i was n't expecting miracles but i do n't see any difference in texture or color , or firmness of my skin maybe , it needs to be used with other obagi products , but for the price , i would expect to see some type of change after 3 weeks of using it alone
3	this is a little watery or oily , not sure , but it does separate so be sure to shake it before use i personally did n't like this as a foundation on its own but it was good to mix with my regular foundation on its own , it was n't enough coverage and too pink and glowy mixed with my regular foundation , it added color a glow to my foundation i would not purchase it in the future because i would not use it on its own
5	one of my favorite colors , especially for the fall and winter ! perfect maroon color if you do thin coats , the first may be slightly streaky and light , but the second coat evens it out , and darkens it completely if using for nail art , with a smaller , more concentrated amount on an art brush , i have definitely used just one coat the formula is one of the best very smooth and easy to apply
4	i realize there is no magic pill , bullet , or device to aid in anything related to the human body , specifically when it comes to aging i am reviewing this as a vine reviewer , who had 30 days to do so i am reviewing this exactly 30 days after receiving it so , when i tell you i 've only started to see some signs of progress , i am more hopeful than anything that in the following weeks what is promised will be delivered granted , anything worth doing is worth doing right so , be patient the good thing is is that this ergonomic device is rechargeable and very portable you can do the training on the go which helps in setting your schedule from what i 've seen and then read , this will take some time it works by providing a mild electrical current to stimulate facial muscles back to a more youthful firmness \( do n't be stupid check with your doctor if you already have electrical devices in your body \) i am trying to lose weight and as such , certain parts of the body shrinks more quickly than the other one of those is the face so , this has come in handy or will come in handy when i start to lose what the once held taught make sure your face is clean beforehand they give you a gel to help cleanse it , but i would recommend an off the shelf cleanser and to make sure you really dry your face some users are shocks i suspect that this is because they did n't learn that electricity and water are a shocking combination understand as well that you can turn down the intensity of the current
5	this is the best dry shampoo i have ever used the fragrance smells so fresh that people often stop to comment on how nice i smell this also does a great job at making my hair look nice between shampoos
4	i have been using shellac on my nails for quite a while and they were becoming dry i began using all cnd products \( oil , cleanser too \) and my nails are looking much healthier
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	love the silky , non sticky texture of this product and that less than a pea size dab absorbs quickly leaving my skin soft and hydrated without breaking out my sensitive , combination skin the fresh , marigold like scent is pleasant and does n't linger on your face the cream comes with a little spoon which i like because i do n't waste any of the product under my fingernails while this face cream is outside my typical skincare budget , i 've been impressed with how my complexion has improved after several weeks of use i plan to purchase once my sample runs out
4	this bottle arrived with the push in top pushed in , but not quite enough to be open poor packaging on amazon 's part could have ended up making a very messy delivery this cleansing oil is nice it has no scent at all , and although it feels really oily going on , it does a great job removing all makeup , including waterproof mascara , and wipes away nicely with warm water i am not thrilled with the bottle top while it 's good for travel since it can be closed , it pours out really easily i'm not a big fan of using cotton balls as the directions indicate is proper usage , but it would certainly work better than pouring into your hand this is really too pricey for me to purchase on a regular basis , but i will see how long the bottle lasts and how my skin reacts with continued use before deciding a great product otherwise
5	it takes some getting used to in letting dry and also removal , but overall this is the best mascara you can buy
5	a well received gift
4	this is the second product by the brand that i have tried i am a big fan of the lip gloss palette that i have of theirs \( such a nice size ! \) , and this compact is nicely packaged as well the clasp to open and close is flush which means that there is less chance that this will open in your purse by accident it includes a powder puff applicator as well \( if i am hope , i instead use a finishing powder brush \) i like the blend of colors and it applies very finely and adds the perfect final touch to your makeup it can definitely be used for quick touch ups too , but i would n't use this as the only face product all in all , i am quite pleased with it most of my experience with finishing powders have been in a looser powder form , so this did take a little bit of getting used to , but overall , i am quite pleased !
4	the shampoo has a string coconut scent , 24 for 6 7 oz and comes in a metal bottle i use have used the phyto , that i like a lot it bottle was damaged on arrival since it was in an envelope rather than a box the opening is way to large ! i poured out probably a weeks worth of shampoo a little goes a long way so slowly pour into hand its creamy , milky , silky and feels gentle on my hair , not stripping it like other more harsh shampoos just not a big fan of the strong coconut scent but i can get passed that
4	what i thought it would be
5	face feels lifted after use
5	the most amazing color ever ! this is a soft pink with subtle glimmer , just classy and elegant
5	definitely will buy it again necessary for daily and night skincare routine
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	this body tender milk comes out in an ultra fine stream the fragrance is light and delicate i applied this lotion before bedtime and the scent was still subtly there when i woke up in the morning this would be a great alternative for someone who wanted a light perfume fragrance without needing to spray it onto your body or clothing i really enjoy this fragrance , and while the lotion is n't ultra moisturizing , it has a lovely scent and helps provide a little bit of moisture to the skin
5	i'm a fan of creamy cleansers over foaming cleansers and this one by mario badescu is great i have dry , acne prone , sensitive skin and this worked perfectly with my skin type it creates a nice creamy lather and gets skin very clean , but without stripping moisture or leaving a residue behind i still slightly prefer my current cleanser \( glamglow thirsty cleanse \) to this because i like the scent better , but this is still a very effective cleanser
5	this meg21 skin care anti oxidant boost is supposed to work best in conjunction with a hydrating moisturizer meg21 has its own face treatment and advanced formula i have some aging spots on my face and once i apply this cell therapy i feel it work right away 1 ounce 30 grams can be quite expensive at 100 but i'm glad the product is made in the usa and there are some serious claims to the product working well according to the meg21 website i have not waited the recommended 28 days to see the full difference the product claims to make but i can see some improvement in my skin with regards to reduced roughness and increased firmness
5	i do my own nails at home and love cnd shellac it is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days my nails always look amazing and i get a ton of compliments i also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome
5	huge fan of skinmedica products this essential serum is as the name suggests , the product to get if you 're only splurging for one i use it for all over moisturizing , wrinkle reduction , eye cream , and neck cream i know that there have been some reviews that there are knock being passed off as skinmedica here , but the product i received looks like the one i 've gotten from the dermatologist highly recommend it !
5	i can be hard on my nails so when i paint them at home i always go for a good base and top coats i like this one because it provides a durable layer over my polish so my nails last longer \( chipping or breaking less \) and without the color of the polish underneath would recommend
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
3	first off , when i requested this from vine i thought it was a facial moisturizer , which is not its intended purpose i have tried it on the face for when i'm feeling winter dry flaky skin and it does work well , but the product is very thick and you 'd have to wait some time for it all to sink in before applying makeup as a night cream \? again might work , but the scent is so strong i would n't be able to apply it and stick my head right into a pillow and smelling it all night yes , the scent does dissipate , but not immediately as a body moisturizer \? i liked it a lot , despite the thickness of the cream \( apply lightly and then add more if you like \) it does help with the winter dry flakiness , and right after applying i could pour water on my skin and it it a good thing for those out in the great outdoors as for the sunscreen aspects \? it 's november in seattle and we 've not much sunshine these days , so i ca n't test it or comment on that aspect of the product at this time all in all a good moisturizer , except for the strong scent i am sensitive to perfumes and aftershaves and other strongly scented things , so that is a deal breaker for me and thus the lower rating your mileage may vary
3	as with many products made in france , especially moisturizers , this product has a very strong fragrance it 's as if the french ca n't resist using their abundance of floral and the cream goes on smoothly and does n't leave an oily residue but i did n't find it that much better or worse than ones i 've already using , like immortelle precious night cream by l'occitane the main thing i do n't like is that , for the price , half of the ingredients are man made not good if you 're trying to stick to products that have more natural or organic products in addition , for 24 hour coverage , it does n't contain any sunblock or sunscreen for when you go out during the daytime hours , so i would consider this more of a night cream than an all purpose one
3	the color i ordered is a teensy bit too light , but coverage is sheer it is oil free , but i do get a shine just like with all the others , so ca n't see that it 's any better at oil control than any of the others would i buy again \? probably not and will continue to search for the perfect product for my oil skin i still prefer mary kay 's matte foundation to any others i 've tried
5	i love love love this color no matter what season , it always looks great and i get compliments on it
5	i actually had this curling iron before for 7 years i lost it when i was traveling when i returned from my trip , i thought i would pick up a less expensive iron at cvs my hair looked like what i paid for needless to say , i was excited to find hot tools pro on amazon and i bought 2 my hair looks amazing again ! shipping was very quick price was a fraction of what i would have paid in a store
1	didnt work for me moving on from mario badescu tried multiple products nothing worked !
5	the best skin care i have ever used !
5	so bright it did last everyone gave me compliments on the color i 'll be wearing it next spring and summer again !
5	great color !
4	holds heat well , sturdy and economical
5	great polish !
5	dermablend intense powder camo is an excellent product easy to apply and provides exactly the right amount of coverage you desire i apply a light layer and find that it hides the dark areas under my eyes and even the red remainder of an unexpected zit also provided a nice matte finish that i completed with my powder blush and i was set it comes in a nice compact with a sponge in a separate compartment and the finish may be customized too if you want a dewy finish , pat your skin gently with a wet sponge after applying the powder to your face i have very delicate skin and do not need heavy cakey makeup this dermablend fills all my requirements and is made in the usa
2	top expensive and leaves residue in my hair
5	great brand and great color !
3	i saw this in a salon i frequent but it was expensive i thought this was a good buy but i am not sure it was as strong as the one i saw in the salon could not find info on how strong it was
5	goes on non greasy does not have a heavy smell to it makes my skin feel very soft and supple definitely something i would continue to use like it a lot
4	my niece likes this stuff and says it works good she says it helps her hair so it does not get tangles in it through out the day
4	although my lips are nicely shaped , they are , alas , thin while that is not likely to change \( without surgical \) , i find lipsticks with lip plumping properties irresistible this lipstick by butter promises to not only pump up my pout but make me feel good while doing it by of a phyto complex i received the product in lucky which is a mauve pink color creamy and thick it applies easily it is opaque with a slight minty fragrance initially it had a gentle tingle that lasted about fifteen minutes it does not burn or sting like some and did seem to have a volume enhancing effect the finish is more of a satin than a matte there is some shine i applied without lip liner or balm or primer and the lipstick stayed put there was no bleeding or feathering i did have to reapply after lunch but found it reasonably long lasting there was n't much transfer when wiped with a dinner napkin or residue on coffee cups or drinking glasses the black container looks sleek and remains securely closed i ca n't say i noticed any mood enhancing effects from the plant that being said , wearing a flattering shade of lipstick makes one look better which is a mood booster in and of itself i did not experience any irritation or dryness after use of this product it claims to moisturizer over time , but i have n't been using it long enough to assess that claim putting aside the mood boosting , this is a nice formulation that feels and looks great the color is flattering with good saturation and you will enjoy some lip plumping appropriate for all ages , this is a terrific way to update your look
5	been using for months now , its my go to and i keep coming back to it after trying other face lotions amazing for everyday use i use with the rest of the skyn collection \( night cream , etc \) and i 've never been let down i love these product so much !
4	i bought this product to add shine to my damaged hair if you have used silk infusion before by chi the horrendous smell will be familiar i do like that the product is also a for flat ironing purposes but you must use this very lightly or your hair will be an oil slick i have very thick hair so for me to say this you know it is oily ! i do get great shine when using this product but i do not like that you can only use this before flat ironing or blow drying it is n't the type of spray you can utilize just to get shine , it is just too greasy i was hoping for both options in any case if you want say shine on the go you will need something like bumble and bumble or another type of shine mist that is lighter i do enjoy the results but not as versatile as i would like ! ps chi please please get a different fragrance for your product line everything smells like old man cologne
5	the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me they earn being in a high end category in my opinion they do not seem to be scented or too chemical the jars , tubes , compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make ups i have many favorites among them , yet i believe they all stand very well on their own i hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones i know of here , and including compatible products along the way respectively 1 l'oreal dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo \( no spf \) 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body \( no spf \) 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out it smelled good too it was a truer color in my eyes , since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such also , some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly , and i liked them because they looked very ethereal , as with the pink violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light i have aged , and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product , one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture i especially enjoyed the blur ones now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here , including most recently , a lovely reddish brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put , a super mascara , another lip paint , some face tone enhancers , and a creamy to dry , light colored eye light , among others i am happy to see more high end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike , especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd 1 dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received , and it is my very favorite it covers my skin imperfections well my first attempt with it doesnt count , since i spread it very thin , allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through and i went out that night wondering why this was happening first of all , i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product , and second , i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots now i get it this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all it is lovely if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections and when i apply it with dab it appears blended , and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make up can be it has alone a bit of chroma to it , as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) , in my opinion , unlike many other cover products i have used alone , they gleaming the light more than my other cover make ups , without chalkiness very nice the other purpose for me is that it has a \( 30 spf \) sunscreen all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have \( 25 spf \) or lower , and not my needed \( 30 spf \) that my dermatologist recommends she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage i score 1 , 000 here for this as well as the other qualities of this line the two colors i have are both medium ones , one a bit lighter , and both appropriate for me , especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here and i realize you may not have this type of a menu , but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) needed the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder , and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for this particular product is very fine , not grainy , and perhaps a bit creamy it definitely blends in well it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier , keeping the crme , bases , foundations , from smudging to hands , clothing in various ways , i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades \( separate jars \) when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose a what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder , as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder altogether , with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match , thus prolonging my experience b also , with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face , and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks , nose , chin , forehead , i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium toned translucent powders as described , allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion another plus 1 , 000 for me i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself pick your poison , as i have purchased some powder and crme blushes before today though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look i like to play with the powders , yet , when i am in a rush i will make errors , not being subtle , and not dusting before other products also , i am 62 , and my baggy under eye application errors are the most noticeable i get rid of this bagginess first i will use the powders now , especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications , or with the high quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) listed below and as well as their other foundations all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type , for example they are nice for a youthful complexion and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less noticeable pores , and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined in my case i am fine , and safest when i am well rested 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make up applications even with dusted powders it will make a difference it is that simple 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation ! ! \( 25 spf \) this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder , which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look yet because i preferred the variable built up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme , i missed something with trying this last as before i was too quick to judge i had applied it very thick and then i went out i thought to myself that is was mask like , yet nice moist cover not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers , i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look , then applying more product to the flaws this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make ups , so as with the crme , and the powders , i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a win win win i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray for a fresh stay with or without powders 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo ! ! \( no spf \) this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator , in other compartments while this color is quite dark for me , one quality , besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer , is that i do not see wrinkles really maybe the thin layer or the creaminess \? and the staying power , especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray also , i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck the darker color , applied gently is making a nice bronzer i do know that is stretching it i have n't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product , since this is a very dark color however , i am sure this might possibly work though this does go on thin , and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look very nice camo cover product ! 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body ! ! \( no spf \) wow again i hadnt understood at first how i can use this , as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium \( my shade \) i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me , yet thick as i applied it and silly me ! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have ! double win ! this is a creamy roll up stick cover product which does the job , and which i wo n't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a this is a lovely product i love the idea of having a smooth body skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful , and long lasting dermablend professional leg and body make up however , im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural , yet youthful , less unsightly look it is n't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make up , yet it is the product i will use first especially during the day love 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) it is so nice to wear tights , stockings , or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses , and on ankles under pants above boots however , during cooler months especially , it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look , it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing i absolutely loved the look when i put it on and then darn , i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin this might not be problematic for you with full body applications , as for me on an occasional basis as desired yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother , and will please you i believe as i have expressed that this product renders a nice , airbrushed look , and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) this works fabulously it is creamy and it stays put it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme , because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends , even as i am in my home , shades drawn it covers very well , looks flawless with or without other products , yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line i have it in a tan color , and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin lovely plus 1 , 000 , and very smart very nice products indeed enjoy ! the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me they earn being in a high end category in my opinion they do not seem to be

imperfections and when i apply it with dab it appears blended , and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make up can be it has alone a bit of chroma to it , as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) , in my opinion , unlike many other cover products i have used alone , they gleaming the light more than my other cover make ups , without chalkiness very nice the other purpose for me is that it has a \( 30 spf \) sunscreen all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have \( 25 spf \) or lower , and not my needed \( 30 spf \) that my dermatologist recommends
5	i always enjoy l'occitane products , and this one is no exception my hands do n't feel dry despite being washed very frequently
5	i like to keep things simple , but maybe a little complexity is warranted when it comes to moisturizers for the past ten years ive been using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href olivella all natural virgin olive oil moisturizer from italy 50ml 1 69 fluid ounces dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 olivella all natural virgin olive oil moisturizer from italy \( 50ml \) 1 69 fluid ounces a i like the way it works on mature skin and the ingredient list is all natural \( primarily olive oil and vitamin e \) it seemed like the perfect moisturizer but then i tried vichy aqualia make up , it really makes my face look great , and i noticed a difference immediately i wear cream liquid , followed by a light mineral powder dusting the overall effect is a much softer , better absorbed look just as important , my face remains like that all day like olivella , aqualia thermal doesnt clog pores the vichy box says this product is suitable for dry to very dry skin types i can attest it works well on middle aged skin that said , theres nothing natural about aqualia thermals ingredient list , but what i do notice is better facial tone and appearance its hard to say good bye to my stand by simple moisturizer , but i like aqualia thermals end results much better
5	i love essie nail polish and this will be a favorite of mine it looks like turquoise and that is my favorite color
4	aside from being beautifully designed , this is a highly functional item for your makeup brush collection \( the only thing that would make it better would be if there was a container available to store it in for travel \) i tried this with powdered foundation , blush , finishing powder and bronzer what i liked best is that the powders did not clump or cling to the bristles , which made for a more even application this would also make a great brush to use when contouring your face the feel is soft on your skin , unlike some brushes which actually feel itchy or scratchy the manufacturer does not specify what the bristles are made of , and that is something that could easily be corrected by referring to them only as natural one gets a feeling they do n't want you to know but if you 're going to talk about wisteria handles , why not name the bristle type source \? are they hiding something \? it 's one of the most relevant thing for many people who have allergies , etc or who do not want certain types of materials the way the handles are covered gives a nice , firm grip , welcome given how slippery some handles on brushes are it 's interesting to read the various reviews some folks say that powder gets everywhere , while others say it is contained i 've had both experiences and the difference is the product i am using some powders are very loose , while others are more firm and compact , so less will go on and less will fall off the real test of any brush is how well it wears and it 's way too soon to know this by wear i mean if the bristles stay intact and do n't shed and if the shape remains firm and full so far , so good
5	my boyfriend prefers to be a pretty low fuss guy when it comes to his hair , but also has thick wavy hair that can become unruly without product and some attention to styling for context his hair is longer and wavy on top and shorter on the sides this works for him he uses about a dime sized amount and runs it through his hair when it 's damp it helps keep hair in place and have a more polished look without looking overly shiny or stiff i personally like that we both agree on the scent a lot of men 's styling products smell way too musky and strong to me this is instead a really pleasant , gender neutral scent mostly to me it smells like bourbon or vanilla , but without being sweet i also think the packaging on this is really nice it 's hard to tell from the picture but the look of it is very premium and substantial and consistent with its price tag would recommend
5	this is definitely not as quick dry as some of the opi polishes i 've used in the past , but it layers on very thick and gives a great finished look that more resembles having had your nails professionally done than anything else i 've used at home two coats was perfect , without either the recommended base or top coats it definitely made my nails stronger , and it lasted a solid week before beginning to chip at all \( which is saying something , as i am rough on my nails ! \) even at a week and a half , it 's only just started to chip at the edges trolley away is a lighter color than i usually go for , but i found that it grew on my quickly once i tried it it 's a beautiful neutral , and would be an amazing color for spring light but clean , it 's not really pastel and can almost serve the same way you 'd use a neutral type color , with a hint of extra feminine flare i will be looking to order more from this company , and simply keeping in mind that i ca n't do any dash and go jobs when applying it !
3	i'm not a connoisseur of different brands , but when i did an online search , essie and opi came up as as some of the better brands i chose essie because of the colors that so many of the other reviews where raving about however , i liked the color of this nail polish better on the screen than on my nails but the color is objective , it probably just does n't go with my skin tone the quality seems good i had to put on about 3 thin coats to get a solid color , and if you dry them well in between , it will stay on for at least 5 or 6 days
1	this review is for russian navy nice color , but when you remove it , it 's a real mess , it makes it look like you have dirty hands and nails , the stuff gets under your nails and you have a big mess , your natural nails too awful ! i have it away from my other polishes to be sure i do n't use it again i had to my nails and tried very hard to get the staining off , i wanted to cry i use a base coat too so this is n't the case i love opi , but they can keep this , not sure what there doing , i hope it 's just this color and they have n't changed the formula , i do not recommend this unless you want dirty looking nails and hands upon removal
5	i have the wider version of this , but for some reason this seems to work better on my hair it gives me more control with what i want to do also , it is long which is helpful very pleased
5	great color for medium skin tones excellent product
4	good polish
4	this moisturizing cream smells very nice and has this rich texture when i lather it on my skin it 's oily without being sticky , and it works well on sensitive skin like mine even though it 's meant to be a facial moisturizer , it works well on other parts of the skin as well the only issue i had was with this size it 's absolutely tiny , so you have to use it very sparingly and
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	originally recommended by my dermatologist , i 've ordered this before so am not new to this product if you want to see a change in the overall texture and plumpness of your skin , this is the product it has an odd smell , but that is how you know its real !
5	my new favorite lilac ! !
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
3	covers decently , not as good as derma blend used to be
5	i love absolutely everything about this bliss serum the pump action is smooth , the light color and even lighter fragrance of the cream is quickly absorbed and it feels wonderful i follow this with a moisturizer and during the day , i also use sunscreen this product is not a moisturizer , it is a treatment that enhances the appearance with a little glow
4	after many nights of use , i see no difference in my skin but , full disclosure , i have to say that i use so many products already that this nuxe detox likely is unable to make a further difference fyi i use retinol , glycolic acids , apricot kernel and other oils , mineral sunscreen \( daytime only , of course \) and other products on a fairly regular schedule except for the retinol , none of the products i use are expensive , so this nuxe detox really needs to deliver if i'm going to put it into nightly use at 75 per 1 5 ounce container i did n't see additional improvement , so i wo n't be adding it to my routine i will continue to use up the remainder in the bottle performance aside , this is a beautifully packaged , nice smelling , smooth , easy to apply , pleasant , light cream on me , it soaks in completely within a minute in fact on those few nights when i did n't add moisturizer after application of the nuxe detox , my skin became extremely dry so , for me , it cannot be used alone , even at night if you have a very simple routine and do n't already use retinol and ahas or , this may work for you it has some great ingredients i have read that safflower seed oil is an excellent choice ingredients aqua water , glycerin , carthamus tinctorius \( safflower \) seed oil , 22 alcohols , hydroxyethyl acrylate sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer , octyldodecyl myristate , dimethicone , \( tree \) bark extract , c10 18 triglycerides , dicaprylyl carbonate , butylene glycol , tocopherol , parfum fragrance , c12 20 alkyl glucoside , lauroyl lysine , phenoxyethanol , sodium stearoyl glutamate , dimethicone crosspolymer , ethylhexylglycerin , dehydroacetic acid , allantoin , polysorbate 60 , sorbitan isostearate , hydrolyzed extract , sodium gluconate , sodium hyaluronate , hydrolyzed lupine protein , citric acid , \( \) extract , petal extract , benzyl alcohol , extract , root extract , sodium benzoate , calendula officinalis flower extract , theobroma cacao \( cocoa \) callus powder , angustifolia seed extract , geraniol , alpha isomethyl ionone
4	problem straightening thick wavy hair needs straightening spray otherwise a good product i recommend for most types of hair unisex one of the best
2	i love pca skin but i have mild breakouts , more black heads and white heads and sometimes a random big zit i thought this would clear up my mild break outs honestly i do n't use it that often and my face is pretty dry i have oily skin but this is drying me out i have backed off and stopped using it with drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often so unless you have pretty bad break outs i do n't recommend this i also use the pigmentation bar i love this and i'm sticking to this one for sure that one helps keep my break outs at bay i think
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	love the time and was recommended by my
4	i'm giving this 4 stars bc it did what it said it was going to do went on easy , glides like butter , as they say did not bother my dry , allergy eyes at all did not smudge yet , did not stay either the color did n't run it just was n't there after about an hour i applied at night when it had it 's best chance for long wear i would definitely wear this again bc the brown color is amazing ! it made my sometimes grey , sometimes green eyes sparkle like cat eye green so the fact that it does n't run and made my eyes look that good , i can live with an reapplication for daytime wear , sticking with my lorac waterproof
5	i did not see fibers this is more like a colored , powdered hair shampoo that does add body , and does not leave white residue like a dry shampoo that said , i like this product i have fine , thin curly hair that will droop if i use heavy products i have tried a lot of body building hair products , and many are just too weighty even frizz is not great for me so far , this is a winner
3	this is a nice enough product it cleans the face well , picking up last bits of makeup even after an initial wash , and leaves it feeling good the ingredient list has a few too many chemicals for my taste in particular i could do without the fragrance and the slightly unnatural blue color i have no problem with my toners being clear , and it leaves me with a cleaner feeling than the sense that i'm rubbing color into my clean face
4	seems to be working on all areas of my eye i use just a dab , because it is costly ! ! ! have used before and do like their products
4	i have had much better luck with dermablend 's powder \( s \) than with its foundations what seems to work well as a summer facial protection make up strategy is to first put on a moisturizer with good sunscreen , then put on a primer \( i like l'oreal primers best \) , and then pat a bit of this powder on , removing the excess with a kabuki brush
1	very disappointed it may be 7 free but it 's rated a 6 on ewg ugh ! i was going to go back to essie \( rated a 5 with ewg skin deep \) but will try zoya \( 5 free \) because of all the good things i read about it it was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed
5	love the product and
5	my colored hair is thin and straight but gets frizzy , and i 've been getting noticeable breakage at my hairline which makes my hair look even thinner the only way i can smooth out the frizz and get some decent shape and style into my hair is to blow dry with a round brush after washing i was using the highest heat setting on a professional blow dryer without using a heat protectant as most products weigh my hair down so it looks flatter and even thinner but my damaged hair is so much easier to style and looks improved since using keratin healing oil i work just a small amount into my damp hair after washing \( starting at the ends \) and avoid the crown area because my hair type does gets weighed down easily and can look way too lifeless and flat if i over condition it keratin healing oil has made a noticeable difference in how my hair looks and feels it works best for me if i use only a small amount \( a partial pump \) , avoid hair at my crown and only use it every other wash i tried it everyday and my hair started to look over conditioned and flat but with using it every other wash , i'm really surprised how smooth , healthy and thick my hair looks while also feeling so incredibly soft the benefit is really obvious at the ends of my hair my ends look and feel so smooth while holding style so well , and this oil really revives my hair so it looks like it was just cut and styled at the salon also , my hair looks shiny and healthy but does n't look at all oily when i apply this oil to my damp hair i tried it , but for my hair type i did n't see a benefit applying this oil to my dry hair so far i think this keratin healing oil is a great product , though i can only judge it as a styling product and ca n't speak to any longer range benefits yet my goal beyond having smoother and softer hair is to try to minimize or stop the breakage so my hair will actually thicken up again i 've gone to a medium heat setting on my blow dryer and find that my hair dries in the same amount of time using this oil as when i used a high heat setting without it , so i 'll continue to use lower heat keratin healing oil is supposed to be a heat protectant , so i'm hoping it will help protect against further breakage it will take time to see if this oil can provide that level of benefit , so i 'll update my review as to any change in breakage down the road this oil does have mild to moderate fragrance that does n't bother despite being sensitive to most fragrance , and i do n't notice a lingering scent in my air i'm rating keratin healing oil 4 stars as i'm really happy with the immediate results , and i hope to less breakage over time and upgrade to 5 stars 7 28 2017 update after using this oil for another month , i'm upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars as i'm not seeing new breakage , and the texture of my hair has noticeably improved great product
5	i am simply in love with this leave in conditioner it does n't leave my hair oily in any kind of way it smells amazing and i do n't have to use very much and every tangle falls out with very little effort i do n't know any other leave in conditioner that can do that and i have used a bunch of them i actually do n't use normal conditioner because i have such oily hair , and i mean to the point of i wash it in the morning and by the evening it looks as if i have n't washed it in weeks so , i stopped using normal conditioner and only use leave in conditioner , which has helped my hair tremendously and even more so now that i have found this leave in conditioner it leaves my hair silky smooth whether i blow dry it or not and shinny like never before i really am in love with this leave in conditioner and i am truly glad i found it because it has been perfect with my fine , thin , oily hair
5	my daughter recommended this to me long ago i recently went to a new hairdresser and she uses this on my hair i just love the way it makes my hair feel healthy and strong
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	works great to hide thinning hair patches just shake on the areas that are thinning works by concealing balding scalp areas the micro fibers lay on top of your scalp darkening the area so your otherwise shiny does n't show thru the thinning hair also somewhat thickens the appearance of hair withstands wind pretty well moisture to some degree washes out easily with shampoo and water will also rub off on your hands if you run your hands thru your hair is purely a cosmetic fix to hiding hair loss for it to work well , it 's necessary for there to be some hair , even if it is fine and short , present to which the fibers can adhere and fill in best for concealing small patches causes me no irritation and do n't even know i'm using it it helps to apply a fine hairspray to keep toppik topic in place , but i rarely need to do this if i do , i use a tresemme extra fine mist spray the scent is mild and does n't leave you with old lady smelling helmet hair you can use any hairspray you like , american crew , etc to get the best control over where the fibers go , it 's best to hold the can as close to the head as possible and ever so lightly the can to shake just enough and where you want it there is no reason to hold it high above the head in fact , if you do , fiber will go every which way and may go where its not needed they make a special applicator for the can to spray the fiber , but i find it more efficient to just apply keeping the regular can shaker top close to the head for the front close to the hairline , it 's best to apply back away from the hairline at first and let the fibers naturally fall forward as needed if you apply too close to the hairline , it may look too fake you can always come a bit closer and apply works well for men and women alike has no scent get the color that best matches your hair color you can use 2 different colors if you are looking for a special match , but i find the dark brown works just find for my typical dark brown hair i'm a 40 yr old guy with thinning hair , but i still want to wear a pomp fortunately , i just have some thinning patches and not extensive balding such as on top toppik works for me even if i use pomade to get the pomp look i like i apply toppik after up and getting my hair partially styled i 'll add toppik as needed to the thinning spots as i comb and style the pomade actually seems to help keep toppik adhering better and covers my thinning patches well i 've found that using a water based pomade as a base works best and then using a petrolatum wax based pomade as a topper for shine really helps i add the toppik after applying pomades you can add more pomade if you need to , but i usually then need to add a bit more toppik since some will inevitably come out on your hands when applying pomade to hair that already has toppik applied the stuff is not waterproof and will come out if you get your head soaked face it guys , there 's no miracle cure for hairloss yet toppix is a good cosmetic choice for hiding hairloss , but if you 're bald or otherwise do n't have at least some hair to which toppix can blend into , this may not work for you you can always buy one of the smaller sizes to try out if unsure
3	i sprayed my face \( closing my eyes , exposing my eyelids \) and my skin feels ok , not amazing or anything after a few days my eyelids started to sting , feel very dry , very uncomfortable i realized my eyelids were having some sort of allergic reaction to the spray , but the rest of my face was fine now i just wear sunglasses every time i spray this on my face , i do n't want the product to go to waste haha
4	synthetic brushes are generally better for liquid cream makeup because they do n't absorb the makeup as much and natural brushes generally work best for makeup powders blush etc this contouring brush has natural bristles it is a domed contour brush and it puts on blush evenly i am not a pro so i prefer a brush like this one , that puts on a smaller amount i can always add more if i need to i 've had brushes that put on makeup more heavy make me look clownish besides being a beautiful brush , the handle is comfortable long enough to hold with control however , i prefer a hard , easy to clean handle i think this handle will fall apart over time may even collect keep your brushes clean ! for dry use brushes , wash them at least once a week for brushes you are using with wet foundation cream you really should wash after each use at least a rinse under warm water i wash all brushes with a gentle shampoo but any unscented soap will work i rinse them well with warm water let them air dry not only does this help your brushes last longer stay soft but it is really important to wash out the bacteria dead skin oils makeup that build up quickly on makeup brushes yuck if you do n't take care of them , you can get rashes , breakouts , etc your makeup will be a mess
4	it is always difficult to read a description of perfume because everyone 's chemistry is a little different i think that is the case with this eau de toilette my attention was drawn to the product for a few reasons , it is a good brand , i like citrusy fruity scents and am willing to try something new at first spray i was a little disappointed because it definitely smelled more woodsy , like sandlewood with a little vanilla , but as i sniffed my wrist throughout the day i found that by the end of the day it took on a more citrus scent , not sharp by any means , but than when i first sprayed it on it stays on all day and i would say it is a pretty smell no one note really takes over , so it it seems to have many layers to it and is a more sophisticated elegant scent my husband tends to like fruit citrus scents on me the most but said he thought this was a pretty feminine scent and not overpowering , just right in his words overall , i enjoy the perfume and have worn it for a few days now it wo n't take the place of my favorites , but it definitely has a place in my perfume rotation
5	butter london makes some delicious lip gloss thick and vibrant this color is a bit brighter than you expect , but it smells great and feels wonderful on your lips
5	im completely obsessed with this dry shampoo ! i 've tried so many and this has just taken over my 1 spot \( my old favorite was the dry bar dry shampoo but this one wins with the smell \) the smell of this is amazing fruity but not terribly overpowering it smells the best of any dry shampoo i 've used i have blonde hair so i might not be the best judge for all hair colors , but i find that this is not at all chalky and blends in really well it does give me a little extra volume too i can get 3 4 days out of this will be repurchasing !
4	this moisturizer is very nice the texture is smooth almost whipped , and slightly pearlescent it goes one smoothly and absorbs seamlessly into my skin this is n't like drug store creams the scent is very light and floral nothing obnoxious does it remove wrinkles \? well , the jury is still out on that , i have only had it a few weeks i can say that my skin feels very nice honestly , in this time i have n't noticed any real lifting or erasing properties i did say it was pearlescent which may diffuse the light in a way that makes your skin appear brighter and smoother i am not saying it is glittery i do n't enjoy glitter or even frosty make up \( well i like them , but they do n't flatter my no longer 20 skin ! \) i took a star away for this product sort of claiming it does more than any product really can \( except maybe some prescription \) is it a nice cream \? definitely is it better than cheap stuff \? the texture , absorption , and fragrance are and time will tell if it does improve my skin more than the cheaper stuff i probably would buy this again because it does go into my skin so nicely , but the price might make me use it carefully and trying not to waste it \( like putting it on knowing i am going to shower in a few hours or when i know i will perspire it off shortly doing something \) some people spend a lot on face creams and things , but i can be kinda cheap while i enjoy good products , i feel guilty about spending too much one amazing cream would be worth it and hoping over time that this might be it i will update in a few months if i see any serious results
4	i like this serum to protect from the suns damaging rays its very light , odorless , and absorbs easily i put it on after my moisturizer and my skin doesnt feel clogged up or slathered in products it works well as a sunscreen on my face and neck it says it reducing fine lines and signs of aging i do n't see evidence of that on my skin , but as a sunscreen im sure its preventing them from getting worse it also claims to reduce dark spots i have a couple and it is making them slightly lighter in color overall im happy with this product and ill continue to use it
4	i have used baxter moisturizer for years and really like the light and non oily feel on my face i keep it in my gym bag for a post workout shower moisture for midday the deodorant and pomade are new to me and i like them both the deodorant has a fresh clean smell unlike any other and it was non irritating and lasted the day the clay pomade is a firm hold but does n't leave any shiny film or greasy look and buying the kit rather than separates is almost like getting the deodorant for free
4	i 've been using thus for the last 10 days so it 's too early to say if this has helped my skin this is a light weight , almost watery serum light , no strong fragrance it expensive but one pump can cover face and neck will update review after i use it for 4 6
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	does a really great job hydrating after face washing but before applying lotion it 's not as nice as the higher end serums , like la mer , but it 's still pretty good i do think for a similar price , the la roche posay serum \( by the same manufacturer \) is better
4	this is a surprisingly complex scent initially , it 's almost harsh and even though the as one of the top notes , for me the first impression was of a strong with spicy black pepper at the front as it dries down , it reveals a crisp ocean salt water note accompanied by a definite \( cedar or pine , perhaps \? \) this is the perfect gender neutral fragrance with only the slightest hints of floral but even though the floral is very , after about an hour , the scent this most reminded me of was a past favorite 's i have no idea whether the floral note in ck2 is iris or not , but the lingering effect is similar to the popular fragrance the only reason i would probably not recommend this is that , similar to , the lasting power is fairly weak while the scent did not dissipate completely over the course of the work day , the strength and complexity faded significantly within the first two hours
3	at the time i am writing this review there is no price on this product so i cannot comment on if it is worth it i have pretty fair skin and a lot of makeup seems to change color on me i'm not sure how but there are few foundations i can wear that do n't either turn me orange or ghostly normally wear makeup i purchase from sephora , i tend to have to change brands often because the makeup companies do n't like to make the things that make my skin for more than 6 months , then it 's discontinued and i have to start all over again so i thought i would try this it is a powder in a compact with a mirror it comes with your standard puff that you can leave in it all day long the look of the makeup at first glance is marbled the look when it is put on is much lighter than what you see in the makeup if i hold the compact up to my face , it looks too dark however when applied it is almost too light i put it on over my normal routine of lotion , and primer to see if it would work on it 's own it looked good at first , but required multiple through the day so the next day i did my normal routine and used my normal liquid foundation then used this as more of a setting powder it lightened the over all look of my makeup but did seem to work fine to set my normal makeup i 'll be honest this is the kind of thing that i would chuck into my purse for emergency touch up if for some reason i needed it i'm not the girl that spends hours on her makeup so it is n't often that occurs i most likely wo n't be buying it again because it did n't last to replace something in what i already do and i do n't want to add any more steps to what i'm doing without a significant benefit i did n't get that here it was just an added step without any significant change in the over all appearance of my makeup it 's not a bad product i think it 's just that it lacks a place in my personal routine it also is deceiving in the color it appears to be from what color appears on your skin if you can have someone apply it to test for the right color and you are looking for something to set what you are already wearing then this might be a good choice
5	great product !
5	i have very very very sensitive , oily skin prone to redness this has replaced all other cleansers because it does what its meant to do , and does not strip the oil my skin is balanced and clear , and as with all mario badescu products , this is the absolute end all for me in terms of comfort zero irritation trying new face products is always a gamble for me , but not anymore im 26 and have been hunting since i was 13 for the right skincare line finally found it !
4	opening this was like christmas morning this body milk was beautifully packaged in an box and at first i was n't certain what i received purely based on appearance , i knew the packaging was setting me up for an experience that i 'd either love or hate i am absolutely crazy about this scent forget all this stuff about fruit and roses they are in there , but what this scent is about is fresh yet fragrant it is whisper light and yet a pleasing combination of scents that is subtle and sophisticated i gave this a quick spray on my neck and this lasted for hours and did not need to be replenished i'm usually not into scent and use a lemon soap when i bathe it is faintly sweet smelling and very light , but is not nearly as distinct as this body milk
5	i have been looking for a gentle cleanser to wash my face with this one does the trick i will be honest i have never heard of vichy before and this product is really nice it smells good \( not too sweet \) and clean it lathers up nicely with just a little bit of gel this 6 76 fl oz bottle is going to go a long ways since you do n't need a lot of gel to lather up your face i have sensitive skin and this one does not irritate it at all it is a bit pricey for a facial cleanser , but when you look at how long it lasts , you 're getting your money 's worth i love the fact that it is paraben free it seems that just about everything has these chemicals in their products and it 's hard to find something that does n't have paraben in it this helps a lot i will definitely be on the for more vichy products this is definitely going to be one of my favorite facial cleansers it 's better than oil of olay , which i have been using
1	for a few more dollars i could 've gotten a much bigger bottle ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! content amount is not worth it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's a rip off to buy this item for that amount
5	i bought this for a christmas gift i give one or two of these along with some other items to a friend every year she loves , loves , loves this soap
4	good polish
4	really pleased with toppik hair building fibers i would prefer to have a thick head of hair but since that is not the case i am very thankful for this product it gives me the confidence to go out and feel comfortable without worrying that people are staring at my thinning hair
5	i 'll caveat this review by saying i'm not a hair stylist and no nothing as in zip , , nada about the tools used in that profession however my better half has been a stylist for twenty years and serves as creative for one of the top ten day spas in the united states he knows his scissors and then some based on his feedback babyliss tools are a top choice for professionals for a couple of reasons they hold up to heavy commercial use superior build quality solid comfortable grip and easy to work with as for sizing the one inch is the most popular and any hair stylist worth their salt can straighten any size curl or wave with the one inch diameter plate the price on amazon was the best beating out even the closed to the general public beauty supply houses that only to professionals over the years i 've found this to be true with virtually all his tools of trade and recently bought him a pair of 700 for with free shipping to boot as for the flat iron it arrived in it 's sealed retail packaging and again with a prime membership you get free two day shipping to boot
5	saw this nail polish color on pinterest and i searched the stores trying to find it and then i saw it on here and i was a little skeptical buying nail polish online but it came brand new and the color is a dead match !
4	not sure it 's worth the high price , but it holds well and lacks that terrible hairspray odor that i loathe
5	i was really surprised by this oil i had imagined that it would be like baby oil and leave my face feeling uncomfortably greasy nope it is quite oily when you use the dropper to put drops of the oil in your hand before applying it , but once on my face it is absorbed quickly leaving it feeling soft it dose a much better job of giving me a more youthful look and glow than any of my face creams for mature skin and a little goes a long way 4 or 5 drops covers my face and neck the fragrance is a lovely botanical scent the scent is light and does n't linger so no worries about clashes with the fragrances of other toiletries or perfume
3	this is a sunscreen before it is a moisturizer it absolutely has the feel and scent of a sunscreen and lays on the face like a sunscreen rather than a moisturizer the active ingredients in it are sunscreen agents , so that tells you something right there there 's no way i would use or recommend this as an everyday moisturizer or firming moisturizer as a sunscreen for summer or sunny months , it is fine and may have some skin improving properties on top of being a sunscreen for everyday , year round use , i cant see using it it has the heavy feel and texture of a sunscreen and the same sort of layer on the skin , rather than absorbing into the skin like a moisturizer should it also has the same slightly greasy slick feel that a sunscreen does because it is a sunscreen i think it would be much better marketed as a sunscreen rather than a moisturizer which has sunscreen in it again , go right back to the ingredients and see for yourself the active ingredients are sunscreens then there is a list of inactive ingredients which are a combination of typical moisturizer ingredients as well as other ingredients found in sunscreens
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	this is certainly a heavy duty hand cream my skin is horrible in hard water , so when i'm staying at hotels it can get to the point that my knuckles and heels will actually crack and bleed it 's times like those that i need a hand cream like this pros unscented i'm so tired of heavily scented hand creams i do n't want everyone around me being by the scent of lotion wafting around works like a dream i tossed some on my heels because i had excess from my hands , and i keep rubbing my feet together , they feel so soft you do n't need much like other baxter products , a pea sized amount will do for most people they pack a lot of action into a small size cons expensive although if you use a little at a time , this will definitely last overall this is an amazing hand cream , and it 's not just for men since it 's unscented try some today
5	nice color
4	pretty creamy good product
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	usually , my nail polish chips in 1 day this one is long lasting , but i find that i need to shake it often \( almost between each nail \) or it gets clumpy , and then it dries with a dull finish nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat ca n't fix i'm really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4
5	nice product
5	best dry shampoo out there
4	i remember my mom hot rolling her hair when i was a kid with ancient rollers from conair that are late 70 's they still work but they are absolutely a fire hazard but i still remember the that hold them in and pinch your scalp and the scorching heat that burned my as the curlers set these are a little bit of a step above i have another set of hot rollers which are a little more like my mom 's old conair ones they 're also babyliss which is kind of conair 21st century those are the same style the ceramic without the velvet coating they slip out of my thick but fine hair easily and do n't heat up as much as i need them to these are kind of a little bit of a marriage between my new age ones and my mom 's older ones they have the new clips the kind and the old school based on your preference they are large , 1 5 inch rollers which are not enough to get tight curls if your hair is any length shorter than shoulders , these are only going to give you bounce , not curl they 're only designed to give big waves even in the longest of tresses i find that these heat up quick but not instantly the velvet coating makes them touchable quickly so you can handle them without burning your hands immediately i find that if i the section before i put the hair in the curls and volume last a lot longer however these are not all day curls for me , at least in my hair the body and the soft waves last a decent while , depending on the amount of product and fluff i put into it it 's an easy set and forget type of do that 's easy to put in while you 're eating breakfast , putting on makeup , walking the dog \( yup , expect some looks , but it 's ok \) it 's important to mention that hair needs to be dry while using these also i found that the metal clips are less likely to leave funny looking in your hair although they are more painful to wear overall , a quick way to set your hair !
3	this product has a slightly floral fragrance the directions say to apply with a cotton wool pad if you have very heavy makeup this will probably not remove it all if your skin is sensitive to cleansers and soap this might be worth the price however my skin felt much cleaner and makeup seemed easier to remove with soap and water for those who are very about their products being sealed this had no safety plastic seals , it just simply opens and you can apply it the price seems extremely high for those who can use soap and water unless you really enjoy fancy water and want to pay the price
3	this wears off quite fast i was disappointed in that , otherwise it is a great product
1	i purchased this from ulta i enjoy a couple of mb other things , so gave this a try i have sensitive , combination oily , acne prone skin i used this item maybe 6 times during a 3 week period i followed the directions closely , and used it on a few acne spots on my face out of the few , only one whitehead disappeared within a few days i do n't know if it 's because of this item , or the fact that i for once did n't pick at my skin and left it alone , or that i used a clarisonic brush on my face daily but since the other acne spots did n't disappear either , i contribute it to the fact that i did n't mess with my face and tried very hard to keep my face clean and moisturized i think this stuff is overpriced for the value i have better results using drug store brands , changing pillow cases and towels every other day , and keeping my hands off my face i returned it
5	love it , will buy it again
4	went to get my nails done and chose this color i love it so many people have asked me about who made it i would have given it a 5 star rating but sometimes , you 'll need 3 coats instead of 2 to get the true color
1	this over price lip balm went on heavy and waxy it did not penetrate my lips with moisture it just sat on my lips like candle wax the only good thing is it does not have a taste to it i love all of the avene skin care line it have given me back my youth but this lip balm is terrible
5	when first sprayed , to me it is like fresh linen , floral and sweet , and a tiny bit of spice then after an hour it changes character and becomes more subtle and has a powdery sensual fragrance
4	this setting powder is easy to use but contains talc the ingredients include talc , liquidum mineral oil huile , zinc stearate , propylparaben i 've had trouble with talc before so only use this on days when i know i will be really sweating for fear i will have a reaction it does give your face an even whitening look think girl but not as white because i have a natural olive complexion so it make me look a little strange and washed out which i had mixed feeling about in the summer however , it did keep my makeup from running too much since i actually run on the drier side with my skin a little went a long way with this but people with an oily complexion will probably like it more and use more of it the compact is very densely pack so it will last a long time so if you do n't have any trouble with the ingredients and have oilier skin and want an even look that whitens your face this is a great pick
4	i really like this skin care package my face feels tighter , cleaner and looks a little more bright
5	i have very thin hair on the top and front of my head i'm a 41 yr old female with female pattern baldness i have medium brown curly hair based on previous reviews i chose light brown i'm happy i did me because it blended perfectly to apply i found the spray applicator works best for me i dry and style my hair and then gently lift sections up and holding the sprayer 3 6 above my hair , give shallow to the shaft and 2 3 in length from my scalp then i lay the hair back in the desired style and generally mist the hair in the thinnest spots patting the hair to gently push it into the hair itself then light spray with hairspray i have also not used hair spray and it stayed in place as well it has never come off on my pillow or my clothes the only issue i have is getting too close to my scalp it can become dots in my bald spots if not careful if you have a small bald spot this would be fine , but my hair is so thin i would need a lot of product to cover my scalp toppik plumps the hair i have and my scalp in color to minimize my scalp showing my husband thinks it looks really natural he did n't know what i had done but kept saying how good my hair looked he was surprised when i told and showed him the product he had no idea it was fibers ! part of what really makes my hair look thicker is that this product is great to make your hairline part look thinner and thus making your hair appear fuller to keep a straight part line , lay a pipe cleaner on top of your part or use a piece of paper to cover the part line and then apply to toppik over the paper pipe cleaner you will be amazed how minimizing your part the look of your hair ! it 's a good solution with little effort depending in your type of thinning balding will determine if the product is successful for you the product does attach to the hair you have and does appear thicker and it does not come off until you wash it it did exactly what it promised to good luck !
4	i really like this my eyes are red under and on top this is the perfect color to cover and make around my eyes look brighter but not white it goes on smooth with a paint brush and is easy to blend in eye shadow went on well over it and so did the eyeliner it was just the perfect color for me and did n't gather in my crows feet or run when my eyes water update after using it for awhile i'm not very happy with the brush applicator the brush gets hard and crusty and it hurts to push it against the sensitive skin under my eye the cream comes up through the middle of the paint brush applicator and i never know till it is too late how much i am pushing out ! this is a waist as i use very little and then it gets crusty after a couple days very happy still with everything
5	i love it so much
5	this is an effective deep cleansing shampoo with this shampoo i would really recommend that you first wash your hair with a cheaper shampoo then follow with this i have found that on the first round of shampoo this does not lather well , so you 'll end up using more than you need if you want a rich lather so if you use a cheaper shampoo first to remove the surface dirt on your hair and scalp , and then you use this shampoo , the bottle will last a lot longer and you will get more of the scalp deep cleansing
5	i rarely wear makeup when i do , applying this primer underneath gives me a smoother looking face worn without makeup , it 's colorless , and it makes the skin on my face feel baby soft and smooth i have unusually sensitive skin , and this did n't cause any irritation at all i like that it contains sunscreen , as my face is protected when i go outside it does have a bit of a learning curve to dispense the lotion , and it took me a few minutes to figure it out pull the silver top off , then twist the pointy top to the counter clockwise \( or clockwise if you 're holding the bottle upside down \)
2	this lotion is lightweight really lightweight if you need a lot of moisturizing then this probably wo n't be enough it goes on smoothly it has a mild scent it has a bit of a weird lemony scent to it which i do n't care for , but fortunately its mild this lotion does not make my skin feel greasy as far as the laser part goes , i do n't really feel this product lives up to its claims it says diminishes lines wrinkles , , smooths and results are supposed to be fairly quick it gives you a week by week breakdown of what it does it softens and smooths skin instantly skin looks plumper by one week appearance of lines and wrinkles diminishes by 2 weeks skin texture significantly improves by 3 weeks skin looks transformed by 4 weeks well , ive been using this for 4 weeks now and really have n't noticed anything i like this product as a lightweight moisturizer , but the cost doesnt justify using it for just that
5	love anything by la roche posay i have used this product for the last 10 years excellent quality my dermatologist introduced me to this line prompt delivery !
2	this nuxe mask smells amazing and the packaging is amazingly fun , it 's got an on off swivel top under the pull cap , and a easy spinning metal tip applicator unfortunately , that 's about as far as my love goes it 's not thick like a typical mask , but thin and more fluid like a serum in fact it 's so thin that after turning the tube off and using the cooling metal tip to massage the mask into my skin per the instructions i do n't feel like i really have any mask left on , it 's all been massaged into my skin which makes step 3 , wiping with a cotton round feel unnecessary while my skin is soft after using , i would n't say it was more plump and i would n't say it was softer than it was if this was a leave on serum underneath a moisturizer i might be more inclined to purchase with the really high price tag but , since it 's a mask , meant to be removed , it 's too much for too little this is one nuxe thats a miss for me
4	this is the second product by juice beauty i have used and so far i am warming up to each of them in my opinion i would n't consider this to be a peel , i thought the consistency of it would be thick but i was quite surprised that it was a light brown gel more like a mask or a scrub it smells very good and has a light apple scent , everything about this is organic and natural the directions state to apply a generous amount to a clean face and neck which i did , i'm not sure about everyone else but while applying i felt a tingly feel so be very careful not to get this anywhere near your eyes , mouth and nose you let it sit on your face for 10 minutes , within those 10 minutes the gel starts to set on your face and hardens just a little bit , it is still sticky like so be careful not to lay your face on anything , after 10 minutes are up wash off with cool water once everything was done accordingly , i loved the way my face felt , very clean and refreshing you can then follow up with another juice beauty product for toning and moisturizing would love to try more products by this line because i'm very impressed so far
5	just reordered pevonia hydrating sunscreen , spf 30 , 5 oz it is really gentle on my face and offers the protection i need it is a little pricey but lasts a long time because you only need a little dab wish it was in a different type container though it is a bit clumsy
1	does not work but smells good
1	i did not purchase this on amazon , i paid 9 u s dollars for this and it 's awful on preserving the french manicure , it turned my nails green , even in very thin layer , which i only applied one , then the shiny top coat , not impressed , was excited being it is cnd but it 's terrible , returned to opi , my french manicure is brighter and healthier looking
5	spreads the product evenly over the area every few uses i turn the applicator upside down to fluff the fibers inside this keeps the product spraying evenly and not concentrated in one spot
5	very nice and light shampoo , it does n't leave a greasy feel in your hair like the shampoos on the market today i have fine hair and was struggling to find something that would n't weigh it down , this is it , it rinses right out that my hair , back in the day my mom would always say , you rinse until your hair and this stuff does just that , nice body to my hair and i like the scent , i also grew up with egg shampoo , i was happy to see someone still sold egg shampoo , if you have fine lifeless hair then this is for you , try it
5	great color ! very soft and gentle
4	i usually love l'occitane products and this one did not disappoint it is not at soothing as the shea butter products , but works well as an everyday hand lotion and the smell is great , it 's not too strong , but is a nice aroma
5	good spot treatment
5	i have been wanting to try oil cleansing but have about doing my research to make it happen , so this product was fantastic for me the oil is super light and does n't leave even a hit of oiliness once rinsed off , yet it removes even my most heavy duty makeup with ease my favorite part is that that my skin never feels dry after washing it is basically hydrated and soft as long as it continues to work and not cause breakouts , i will very likely repurchase this
3	this is an ok product i'm being more conscious about my make up lately and chose this brand it does n't have a wow factor but it does extension wait job
4	nice product clings to your hair and scalp effectively even without any hair spray
5	i love this scent ! orange and cedar wood smell divine , so uplifting in the morning the scrub feels wonderful in my dry desert skin , very moisturizing
2	i do n't understand such a pretty color every now and then some of cnd shellac colors will wrinkle on me even if o put very thin coats this bicycle yellow did that and now i do not use it
3	i 've been using this product for quite some time now daily as directed and i ca n't really say i have seen any difference i know it is supposed to a performance booster and be used in with the skin care products you already use , so i was n't looking for any extreme change in my skin to begin with here is what i can say this product is an oil it should be used in small amounts if you have very oily skin , as an esthetician , i am going to recommend you not try it at all i tend to be a bit on the side and when i first tried it , a few hours after using it , my face started to feel like it needed to be washed i was only using a drop or two and blending it in before applying my daily serum after that , i decided to only use it around my eyes , where i do tend to be a bit drier i can say that it did work well with my eye cream to make the skin around my eyes dry , but other than that nothing significant took place for a well known brand in skin care , i was really hoping i could see a positive difference to report , but unfortunately , i did n't i say skip this extra step in your daily ski care routine it 's just another step and an extra cost
5	ca n't live without this i have silver salt and pepper hair and my worst nightmare is yellow hair this is great !
5	per the wife i am 55 , have olive skin , and spent way too much time in the sun in my youth i have dark spots on both sides of my face that i am constantly trying to lighten i have tried a lot of c serums \( check my feedback \) some super expensive , others not so much i often use retinols and hydroquinone to bleach my skin , so my skin is used to strong products \( i warn you because this is 20 serum , and you may need to start with obagi 's 10 , but i did not \) i love this serum it is not sticky or oily like many others i have used i like the from skinceuticals , but it takes 10 minutes to absorb and then i have found with overuse it is too harsh for me this one if perfect , in fact so nice that i just ordered obagi 's night cream to give that a try too i am really pleased with the scent \( a light pleasant citrus \) , consistency \( not too thin , not too thick just right ! \) and the lack of stickiness i have used it under makeup with no issue , and at night under moisturizer my skin is glowing i definitely intend to buy more of this and more obagi in general
3	this bronzer is a very decent size , although i feel like for the price the packaging could have been a lot more exciting i also noticed that the container called this a matte bronzer which is also not true there is glitter in this although on the face , it 's very hard to tell so it does n't matter that much this is also pretty pigmented which is nice , but it 's important to use a light hand or else it goes on strong personally , i would save your cash and go after a bronzer by rimmel or maybelline , but this is still a good bronzer
4	this quality grooming kit is really geared for the person who likes the finer things in life yes , it 's marketed for a man but i feel it 's suitable for a rugged woman too all are stainless steel with a satin finish and come packaged in a supple brown leather case with a zippered closure there are tiny into the case for each instrument included are the following grooming tools listed in order starting with my most favorite flat folding nail clippers sapphire nail file blunted scissors for facial hair such as a mustache , nose hairs , and other small jobs pointed tweezers twin instrument that can be used as a nail cleaner and cuticle pusher i 've used every instrument in this package and love most of them the flat folding nail clippers are my favorite i found them very tricky to use the first time but once i got the hang of it , i was truly impressed they are flat \( almost like a thick nail file \) , yet when they are opened their cutting ability is the best i have ever experienced in nail clippers i found it almost impossible to my nails as i have done with other clippers also they are easy to grip and use without putting extra on the hands unlike all my others the sapphire nail file easily and gently shaped my nail edges the ease and smoothness of this file beats out any i 've tried before and is no comparison to an board or cheap metal files the blunted scissors are great they open and close easily and cut small hairs with ease \( including nose hairs \) i really love that they are blunted on the end to avoid the possibility of sticking myself this scissor far the one i own now over 20 years ago , i purchased a mustache scissor and comb i used the comb to comb out my eyebrows and the precision scissor to trim fly away hair and cut labels off soft objects like pillows and cat beds i 've also used them for trimming the extra long hairs on my therefore , the scissors in this package are a great replacement unfortunately , i feel this grooming kit is without the mustache comb i believe most men using this for facial hair will want a comb also the pointed tweezers are fantastic for removing a or getting rid of that third eyebrow i even pulled chin hairs with them one caveat is that since the tweezers are pointed , there 's limited surface area with which to grab a hair only sometimes is a little more edge needed for those smaller hairs between the eyebrows where the point can actually be a slight nevertheless , these are wonderful the twin instrument is the only tool i get limited use out of i like that one side can be used for cleaning the nails however , i find that sapphire nail file \( which has a pointed edge \) even more useful for this job the cuticle pusher works well too but i prefer to cut my cuticles i definitely will re purpose this tool to wipe away nail polish around my nail edges when i paint my nails according to the package , this set is made in germany , italy , india , , and china overall , this is a high quality grooming kit at the current price of 199 00 i think this is expensive but it is also obvious quality and the leather case is exceptional i am , however , disappointed that at this price that a mustache comb was not included to me that is a major on their part especially since this is being marketed for men on the other hand , i feel this kit is also suitable for women who are a bit on the rugged side i can tell you this is perfect for me and i plan on using this for years to come
5	this color is so lovely ! the product only requires one coat and it lasts for 7 days
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
4	after trying baxter of california 's shampoo , i was a bit leery of what the conditioner would be like i was happy with the mild minty fragrance but was n't wowed by how my hair felt after 3 times of using it it is light and perfect for the summer but would n't hold up well if you were in chlorine a lot the biggest surprise came with the price of the small bottle \( smaller than a soda can \) not worth the price in the end
5	this might just be the most perfect makeup option on the market it provides even smooth coverage whether you like a light finished look or full coverage makeup i do recommend ordering the jane iredale brush to apply the foundation it looks much smoother when applied with the brush i also recommend a heavier moisturizer if your skin tends to be dry since this is a powder foundation if you 've never tried their foundation , visit their website to help pick the perfect color , but i usually buy from amazon since i can find it cheaper there
5	you 'll need a shaving brush and a new blade to enjoy this amazing product absolutely great price and quality
5	i just started using shellac at home got the whole kit on amazon and i'm loving it this color came in a big set that i purchased i really love it it 's great for summer too i generally choose a bit of a deeper shade in reds for my hand , but as it turns out , this looks awesome on my fair skin i will buy more when i use this up to be sure
5	this product does exactly what it is supposed to do but here is what you need to know first , use it sparingly and only every other day if not every 2 3 days because it is really strong second , be careful when combining this with other skin products you are already using , i e tretinoin \( retin a \) etc and third , it will burn when you first start using it which is normal but that will stop this product does work on dark marks i am african american and this is the second bottle i have purchased and i am extremely happy with it nothing else i have purchased has given me the same results the product can be used on other parts of the body besides the face i started to see results within 2 3 weeks and i used it at night and used a sunscreen during the day
5	dj play that song is a semi neon purple color with red undertones i say semi because it 's not a blazing neon it can be worn to work it looks just like it is pictured in the bottle pinkish purple i tried to take pics after applying but my camera would n't capture the real color i tried in sun shade indoors lights but did n't work the color is really pretty to naked eye saturday disco fever is a bright pure orange color this is not a very blazing neon , so i am able to wear it to work it looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors i felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in summer i was a little apprehensive at first because i personally do n't like yellow orange shades but this color worked for me it is more red toned than yellow toned this dark orange looks good on nails too the formula on both the polishes is great two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish they dry quickly but dry matty ish so top coat is a must for me i applied a base coat \( opi base coat \) , 2 coats of polish and a top coat \( opi top coat \) they lasted more than a week on me which is rare \)
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	i really like la roche posay 's products this is a very good foam cleanser that cleans with out leaving your face feeling dry i recently bought formula zinc bar soap and i love it it also cleans very well with out drying i will be using both
5	vichy does it again the pore purifying mask smells wonderful it has a light , fresh , clean scent that makes it a pleasure to apply and wear the results are wonderful , too my skin feels clean , soft and revived after every use it 's addicting !
5	my husband has very sensitive skin and mild rosacea , so he 's constantly looking for skin care that will work for him he really likes the face wash because he feels that his skin is thoroughly cleansed without stripping the moisture and leaving his skin feeling dry and tight on the occasions when he 's had a goatee and needed to shave , he said that the cleanser seemed to condition the hair and made it easier to shave this cleanser is non scented and lathers nicely he 's also a fan of the moisturizer because it does n't irritate is sensitive skin and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy he does n't use the toner for some reason it 's the one step i just ca n't get him to do , but i do use it and i love it i'm 39 years old with very sensitive skin and monthly hormonal breakouts this toner clears my skin up an removes all traces of makeup leaving my skin feeling refreshed my skin has not been irritated and i find the herbal mint scent to be subtle and pleasing to both sexes we highly recommend this skin care set
3	this color might not be to everyone 's taste but i was looking for a grayish blue polish the color looks different in different lighting , sometimes more blue and sometimes more gray it has a nice shimmer too
5	my new favorite lilac ! !
4	this is a clay mask designed to clean your skin and pores obviously some consideration went into the design of the jar as it 's easy to hang onto and get open and the product itself is a nice soft gray color it smells a little bit soapy but it is not offensive the look of it is nice and creamy it is made of two types of french clay , one of which is called with the addition of the clay , this is sort of like a mud bath and works best on oily skin yes it does have aloe vera and other ingredients to moisturize but if you have dry skin and or live in a dry climate , you may want to skip this product
5	great product , i swear by the cnd shellac colors ! this is a great fall color , a bit on the neutral side for color , goes with many other colors !
5	this facial sponge feels awesome ! it is the perfect texture to revitalize and smooth the face the shape is perfect to get into areas around the nose and eyes and chin each side of this little sponge has a different texture , so you can decide which you prefer this sponge turns any common facial cleanser into a skin refining treatment you do n't even need to use a cleanser with the sponge , as it is infused with green tea and is , therefore , antioxidant rich i no longer have to buy an exfoliating scrub this sponge gently removes dead skin cells and the production of new cells the handy little suction is useful for hanging it in the shower between uses
5	good product
4	love this production , but sometimes it comes out a bit , even with the fiberhold spray definitely would recommend it for anyone with thin thinning hair
4	kind of sticky when you use your finger to put it on your eye
5	sexy color ! ! you
5	this simple toner has about 6 7 ingredients in it that 's it ! seaweed is excellent for your skin , and this soothing cleanser makes my face feel like a million bucks after i put it on i use it as a follow up to the glycolic cleanser and it 's a great combo my skin looks fabulous and the smell is comforting \( it 's a bit powdery , which i'm not sure where this comes from since there 's no or listed in the ingredients \) highly recommend
4	this toner has a reasonable scent \( i guess thats why the moisturizer is scent free \) by reasonable i mean its herbal mint not overpowering of course the main ingredient in many toners like this is witch hazel , and thats the same here overall i like it
5	do n't let the price turn you away from this product ! i 've tried other brands of 100 shea butter nothing compares to this ! one tub typically lasts me from october through may \( with daily application \) i apply it to my entire body i apply it each night before bed and wake up to incredibly soft , moisturized skin it 's eliminated my dry , cracked hands too a small amount goes a long way and while it feels greasy upon application , once it absorbs \( fairly quickly too \) you 're good to go ! you 'll know if you 've applied too much because you 'll become waterproof \( lol \) so basically if when you shower the water beads on your skin , you need to use less \)
5	xen tan mousse intense weekly tan is absolutely the most natural looking sunless tanner i 've ever used i have dark olive skin naturally and some tanners have an orange tinge that looks awful on my skin this tanner truly gives you a beautiful bronze tan it 's also buildable for a deep tan if that 's what you 're going for i am using the xen tan tanning mitt , which is really nice i 've always used disposable gloves so i am surprised at how evenly you can spread the foam with this mitt note hand wash the mitt and then allow it to air dry completely before first use because it has a slight surface and there may still be some manufacturing lint and fibers that can affect your final tan if you 're new to sunless tanning , remember than exfoliation is probably the biggest key to an even tan i exfoliate the night before and i recommend these exfoliation towels nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href salux nylon japanese beauty skin bath wash cloth towel 3 blue dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 salux nylon japanese beauty skin bath wash cloth towel \( 3 \) blue a nbsp they are almost weightless , super easy to clean and exfoliate way better than a loofah or a puff make certain you pay close attention to your knees , elbows , neck and ankles when exfoliating as those areas tend to absorb more self tanner and can get too dark this foam has a faint , pleasant scent that disappears completely when dry you must be careful after applying not to get water anywhere you 've applied the tanner for at least 3 hours the color starts to bloom after about an hour but it 's not fully absorbed for at least 3 hours if you get any water on your skin during that time , you 'll see some light spots in your tan so plan carefully sweat does the same thing so do n't apply and then exercise like with any tanner , wear dark clothing during the drying time so you do n't tan your clothing i also avoid sitting on my beige until fully dry the color really does last about a week and it fades pretty naturally since i already have skin , i only apply once a week very fair skinned people may want to apply twice a week to maintain a deeper color if you want to use a sunless tanner , this one is absolutely the best one i 've ever used
5	very good self tanner for being a white lotion usually i can miss some spots or have concentrated spots on the feet but not with this one pros no smell ! a little goes long way , sun kissed look upon first application , not very dark but visible cons none , even price is ok
5	when first sprayed , to me it is like fresh linen , floral and sweet , and a tiny bit of spice then after an hour it changes character and becomes more subtle and has a powdery sensual fragrance
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	perfect red for me
5	jane iredale is the best nothing else need be said be sure to get the perfect color for you at a salon recommendation is needed it is worth the extra step
3	the smell and the like consistency are the reasons for the lower star rating i love that this product is all natural as i read that a tingling sensation will be felt after use , i suppose i was really up for something a lot stronger , but it 's an extremely mild tingling after washing the product off , my skin felt okay , but i did n't feel as it does when i do a peel or mask overall , i'm just not with this product the best thing i like about it is the fact that it does n't contain any bad chemical ingredients
2	after reading all the warnings and potential , i think i will not use it on my face it contains hyaluronic acid and promises re plumping texture it has exterior packaging containing and is meant to be a sunscreen for the face yet is warns one not to leave where children can reach it , not to use it on damaged or broken skin and the vitamin c in it may turn skin yellow and stain clothing also , it has no indication that it has not been tested on animals and is , therefore , probably not a cruelty free product the box also states that it for sensitive skin , anti aging fill in care i think i will stay with my wrinkles and current moisturizer with spf without all of the scary warning
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
5	my hairdresser recommended this product , and i love it ! for reference , i have straight , dry , thick , shoulder length hair i have a lot of fly aways and frizz from dryness my hairdresser recommended using 2 pumps of this product , but i find 1 pump is plenty after i style my hair , i put 1 pump of oil in my palm , rub my hands together , then start running my fingers through my hair to avoid a greasy look , i start at the ends and then really work through entire hair , with a final brush near my top part to get rid of fly aways this product makes my hair very soft , and i love the scent ! i 've been using it for about three weeks and i started right after getting a haircut , so i have n't noticed a big difference in the health of my hair this product is expensive , but only needing 1 pump means it will last a long time
4	it 's great except for the 26 price this 30 spf concealer stick does the job at hiding blemishes so if that 's what you want it for , then you will be happy , as long as you do n't mind the price it 's waterproof just in the same way that most sunscreen is waterproof in other words , the more time you spend in the water , the less waterproof it becomes the light to dark range is ivory light natural beige tan caramel bronze brown deep
5	i very like this ! it makes me feel comfortable when i use this !
5	this is a really nice manicure kit it comes in a red leather pouch with a good snap each piece is durable and well designed the tweezers have good spring and are not too strong to make your fingers hurt the file has a heavy handle making it easier to use the clippers are low profile and will fold flat they are more square than most , but it works well for this my wife loves this and it 's great to stash in a purse or travel bag it 's definitely a bit pricier than other options , but it 's a great gift and feels like good quality
5	love this stuff never go to bed without slathering it on \)
5	this works great in between shampoos and keeps my hair supple i love this product !
5	perfect and came fast thanks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! will buy from again soon best if product is left in for 30 minutes and washed with cold water
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	the most perfect face moisturizer ever
5	i'm using this set with my mia fit clarisonic the radiance has been my go to everyday brush for awhile but it 's nice to try out some different ones the sensitive is a new favorite , it cleans deeply without being too rough on my skin the cashmere brush is unique i was n't sure how well it would work since it 's so very soft but i'm surprised by it it certainly does n't exfoliate or deep clean but it 's wonderfully gentle for days when my skin is broken out or just extra sensitive and i want to use my clarisonic but i do n't want anything too harsh the deep pore brush is ok but i'm saving it for occasional use it 's just a bit too rough for my skin but my skin is on the sensitive side so i'm not surprised by that it does work great on my husbands skin it even clears out blackheads although it does leave his skin red so it 's not something he would use frequently
5	i have a healthy head of hair even at age , and i 've used this product on my hair it works well using after shampoo and conditioner and keeps my hair which is usually pretty tousled very manageable it works for me and i'm sure it works just as well or better for you gals
3	its silver girls it reminds me of flat silver paint for toy models i expected depth and from this silver but nope it was just a silver maybe i 'll add as a top coat and i beat it would really pop !
2	i am a big fan of dermablend make up drops so i was excited for the opportunity to try this product i had high hopes of loving this product ! the powder was a little lackluster on my skin the powder is super very fine and includes a which up very nicely i tried applying the powder with the puff but felt like it was immediately absorbing into my skin and i could n't really tell where the powder had been applied , so i ended up using even more i preferred using a powder brush to apply this so i could tap off the excess powder before applying and so i could better control where it was being applied i did n't love this powder as much as i hoped rather than having a silky feeling going on to my skin , it was more like matte and oil absorbing it made my usually dewy skin feel very dry and matte and although i used the powder sparingly , it did n't blend into my make up and i felt like i had a light dusting of white on my skin it looked a little ghostly , flat and dry i know most powders by design are somewhat oil absorbing but i felt like immediately absorbed into my make up as soon as i applied it more than any other traditional powder i 've used this is the first time i have used a make up setting spray and i did n't notice a dramatic difference using this product it felt nice going on and did have a wide spray to cover my entire face i was pleased that it did n't seem to smear any of my applied make up and it did seem to dry everything in place it did leave my skin a flat and dry looking unfortunately i have very acne prone skin and i felt like this spray up my acne
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great color natural and fresh
5	long wearing and easy to apply formula love the essie line was not able to find in the local store fast shipping and brand new bottle
5	amazing on my horse trainer skin
5	just beautiful !
5	this is a great product that will ensure that your nails are clean before you polish them i would highly recommend it
5	great product and great price i will order this product again quick delivery
5	i hate benzoyl peroxide products , except this one ! ! it has a nice fragrance and left my skin feeling very soft and not irritated definitely would order again
5	pretty color
5	this is the only make up i will ever use i learned about it while working at the orchid in hawaii , people are always complimenting me on my skin and actually it 's the makeup i have oily skin and this does n't come to the surface like other makeup does it also has an spf20 i just love it ! it is so healthy for you i have taken a class and it is one of the best mineral makeups you can use
4	this stick cover tattoo very well and lasts in normal conditions i did n't test it during heavy exercise etc if you find matching color you 're golden i'm not happy with ingredients , mineral oil and talc are the 2 first i do n't have any bad reaction but advanced skincare industry do n't use them , especially for face i would n't use it as a foundation on my face \( the look was too heavy too \)
5	this is the all important powder that you need to set the other foundations or to build up as your own foundation the compact is solid black , with the dermablend logo on the lid in silver the compact opens to reveal the powder , which is highly pigmented beneath the powder , is a sponge if you want to set your foundation , you use one of your makeup brushes and brush the powder over your pre applied foundation if you want to use the powder as the foundation , you use the sponge for application and build up layers as desired
5	i 've heard such great things about this product for such a long time and i finally decided to give it a try a few weeks ago i am so impressed with how fast it works and i love that the ingredients list is very minimal visit my blog at christinaschiccorner com to read my full , more detailed review i posted about it
2	what i like about this eye cream 1 it does not hurt my eyes if some gets in them which is great because i wear contacts 2 a little goes a long long way 3 there 's no scent what could be better 1 it does not absorb i 'll put it on when i wake up and go to work and notice it 's still sitting on top of my skin at lunch time it 's hard to not rub my eyes 2 if i push the pump all the way down , i get almost enough cream for my whole face it only takes a little drop or quick press to do both of my eyes 3 i 've been using this for 2 weeks no change i took a picture of my eye before to make sure i was n't missing anything 4 it did not soften , brighten or remove any puffiness the cream is in a nice dispenser and a little goes a long , long way it glides on nice and i would love to give this stuff 5 stars but but the whole purpose of it is to , and i , reduces the signs of aging , soothes , brightens , reduces puffiness and provides a more rested , youthful appearance and , per the description , this gentle and highly effective eye treatment moisturizer , powered by plant technology , minimizes the appearance of fine lines and crows feet for a younger looking , brighter appearance it just does n't do what it claims
5	i love this product ! it does n't irritate my sensitive skin and has really helped keep more easily clogged pores clean also , it 's great for fading acne
3	like the product but 3 stars for the shoddy way it 's put together like another reviewer , when i opened the top the entire blush popped out onto the floor for the price they are charging i expect the product to be intact and a larger tube as well 4 stars for color and texture 1 star for the shoddy tube
1	did nothing
4	smells good , cleans well , and does n't leave your skin feeling over dry i noticed my skin looked a bit better after a few days of using it i do like the smell , and it has a rich thick lather
5	bright , bold and beautiful for summer
5	i order the entire product line !
5	love the color ! !
5	excellent for thin or thick it is a cool black and is easily applied the nice thing about it is it removes very well with a make up remover wipe
5	i'm going to start by saying i am not a fan of the dry , but this is indeed a dry formulation however , this product works pleasant smell , i have n't needed a recharge , and no irritation for my skin two swipes is all i usually need lasts all day long , and i even noticed it lasts after my evening work outs , and even after the shower after the work out
3	wow if you have sensitivities allergies to fragrance , this might not be the product for you likewise , this smells super feminine to me , so it might not be the first choice of most men the product itself was okay but no better than comparable drugstore versions \( maybe just a little more perfumed \) i guess it 's okay if you are seeking a little extra punch of scent
1	the brush is splayed out so i ca n't really use it just seems like cheap bristles or something \?
4	i have been using cream blushes for years now because of how i can control where and how it is applied , much more so than powder blushes cream blushes can also be layered either very light or deeper and richer i love how this crme blush feels on my skin it is easy to apply with only one layer , it is a sheer , dusty rose but with additional layers , i achieved a warm rosy color which goes well with my skintone i use a bb sunscreen cream on my face in the morning no foundation i applied the blush to my satisfaction and did not touch up unfortunately , the blush was about 90 gone by the end of day so this product does need to be applied again hence i took off a star otherwise , i am very happy with the color , the texture , and the ease of application
5	i am a frequent buyer of super smile because it really works i drink 4 cups of coffee a day and i have no coffee stains i also have caps and on my teeth and it keeps them white no fading or yellowing
5	nice color for summer essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping would recommend essie polish great deal
2	i was surprised to receive red nailpolish this picture is deceiving i was expecting a pink color it shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate
2	i love the color like linen but it 's super runny i 've put on four coats and it still is n't a solid color on my nails
5	i love this product my skin is so sensitive so i ca n't use harsh acne products but every time of the month that is so wonderful \( not \) for us females i break out unless i use something so i was in the lovely position of having to choose between irritated , dry , and peeling skin or blemishes when this time would occur enter this product those days are now over effective at fighting blemishes and it does n't my skin my teenage daughter has the same problems i do and this works just as well for her this is definitely something i 'll be buying on a regular basis
5	i adore the applicator i love the shape , weight and size of the container , this product has me hook , line and brilliant and to seal the deal the makeup itself absorbs quickly and smoothly leaving skin looking flawless i ca n't see how this combination can be beat
5	love it ! helps with oily skin and it smells like cinnamon
3	this is the second bb creme i have tried i like the idea around these cremes , coverage with spf properties along with some skin the vichy creme goes on very smoothly and importantly does not burn my sensitive skin at all the color \( light \) will work for many light skin tones from porcelain to a neutral fair tone my skin has some cool undertones and it blended well this is moisturizing my face felt hydrated and soft these are the best features along with the spf what i did not like was thus sat in my pores this did not minimize them and it sat in fine lines too , seeming to accentuate them this minimal coverage so i had to use a concealer for some uneven tones in my skin overall a good , but i needed to put make up over this product for even coverage and to reduce the appearance of fine lines
2	i have very sensitive skin and the first few days i used this cream it made me a bit red here and there \( no rash , just sorta looked irritated and inflamed \) after about 3 days , the irritation went away and it did start moisturizing my skin it has a very luxurious feel to it it spreads nicely and covers thoroughly and a little goes a long way \( which is good b c you only get a little in this package \) i does seem to have tightened filled in the lines under my eyes a small amount , but nothing super noticeable overall , for the price , i 'd say pass on this one it is rough on sensitive skin and the benefits are very minimally noticeable
3	the first word that comes to mind when i think of this gadget is ouch oh , and ouch , and ouch i guess i just do n't dislike my wrinkles enough to endure this , even on the lowest setting , especially around the eyes the description of it feeling like a rubber band your face is putting it mildly it 's just too uncomfortable for me , and as i said , perhaps i just do n't hate my wrinkles enough quite yet i know people who use it with no problem i tried it on a friend who told me it was only mildly irritating to her i had another friend say she would do it if she felt her wrinkles were enough of a problem , which she does not i had another friend who would n't let me near her with it i think it all depends on how badly you want your wrinkles minimized and how high your pain tolerance is my friend who said it did n't bother her at all has been using it and said she has noticed her skin is smoother so , is it a gadget that works \? it seems it might be but , i could n't tolerate it long enough to see any results at all for me , not a worthy purchase , but for those who can tolerate the pain , it 's fine and worth the effort and cost what i would suggest is perhaps going to a spa and having one treatment to see what it feels like for yourself if you can tolerate it , then purchasing your own would be worth it as i said , my daring friend said she noticed a difference , so i 'd say it works , if you can get past the discomfort
5	as described !
2	i have used la medical , is clinical , , skin , and a variety of other luxury brands , currently and in the past as well as formulated my own after extensive study in cosmetic chemistry , , formulation and clinical aromatherapy after trying for a week , i did n't notice much difference just a few notes about some ingredients , many of which can be found in most face moisturizers moisturizes hydrates protects due to the glyceryl , seed extract , glycerin , shea butter , and mango butter \) goes on smooth and skin conditioning and \( pentaerythrityl , acid , cetearyl , sage and rosemary leaf extracts \) slightly fragrant \( mainly due to fragrance parfum , linalool , limonene , coumarin , and geraniol \) use of extract \( extracted from shrimp \) , is becoming popular for anti aging creams first , its animal based second , used to protect skin from extreme thermal stress like cold temperatures or uv rays third , there is really little to no information on it other than it appears to be in a few luxury products most of the other ingredients include , preservatives , agents , antioxidants , anti aging , etc now , about the use of parabens , i would expect given the trend of moving away from these types of preservatives that a product of this price and quality would approach a more main stream of replacing them just a bit odd for me that the ingredients on the box do n't match what is on the website for example , the box states it contains methylparaben , butylparaben and while the website states methylparaben and ethylparaben over , its a very nice moisturizer and hydrating facial cream , but at the price point of for 1 7oz , it is very over priced compared to other facial creams and ingredients in the luxury category and the environmental working group database did not give it high marks due to use of such as fragrance , triethanolamine , bht , polyacrylamide , phenoxyethanol , and methylparaben
4	i have a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href maybelline expert eyes eyelash curler dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 maybelline expert eyes eyelash curler a nbsp which has flat inserts and which i paid less than 8 for this curler 's inserts are more concave allowing me to get a greater curl however , i do not feel the silicone insert infused with organic blue chamomile is going to make much of a difference on my lashes nevertheless , only time will tell this curler comes with two extra inserts the package recommends replacing the inserts after three months of use the silicone inserts are infused with \( chamomile \) flower extract which is certified organic blue chamomile this product is made in china i will update my review if i have any positive or negative results i do like this beauty product and it does curl my eyelashes well , but i probably would not pay the current price of 18 just for a tad more curl and the promise of conditioned lashes
5	honestly , i love this color it is a coral color and is close to the picture provided for better and smoother spread , i highly recommend rolling and shaking the bottle for optimal color , i recommend applying a single layer first then apply a fuller second layer the coral color pops and is extremely juicy ! this is a perfect mid summer or early fall color but can be used in an ombre for the fall
5	great product and works good for my daughter
5	my favorite hairspray
5	works great for shaving legs in the shower what i love is that this oil is n't slimy at all it rinses out very well but , it 's moisturizes love !
5	i 've been using this for years on my cuticles and it is a great product
5	i was so pleasantly surprised at just how well this product works i had previously used great hair days powder and the toppik fibers blows it out of the water ! i have severe thinning of my hair in the front , due to weight loss and am very self conscious about it this product has restored my confidence ! it is easy to learn to use and gives a very nice finished look , i highly recommend it ! i will be buying it again good luck all \)
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	we always on a lookout for creams that will define curls without weighing them down this cream is all the curl and none of the frizz , at least so far as we try it out in winter i will have to re review this in the summer too it is light , has a nice scent and so far , leaves the curly hair in our family looking great my teenage son has been on a hair cut strike for a couple of years , so he has long really lovely curls when they are treated well this cream slipped effortlessly into his regime to hold the look
5	love love love always get compliments when i wear this color it is red however , it is on the fuschia side ,
5	this is a great product i have been using mitchell for years ! its the best hair product out there
5	i just love love love butter london polish the quality is wonderful and the colors are so vibrant ! goes on with ease !
4	i have to use it very lightly , but it gets its job done and i can get nice and even coverage of my skin without having to mess around too much spreading it with my fingers or anything like that
5	i wanted to give this night cream a try and so far i really like the results this does n't leave my face greasy and absorbs into the skin fast this has chamomile and vitamin a great protection from environmental damage , this can be used for sensitive and combination skin i am impressed how soft and silky my face feels in the morning i could get away with no make up if i choose to , this leaves my face with a nice vibrant color i have recommended this to a few friends as a night cream because the results are great , seller was wonderful also , this cream was packaged in a cute mario badescu bag with samples and boxed perfect , i plan on placing more orders soon with this seller
5	thanks
4	i have always had problems with acne i have tried prescription acne creams , products on television , in the stores , and even received treatment from doctors yet , nothing ever really seemed to work it worked for a little while but then it seemed that the acne would adapt to the products or treatments and stop working i can not count the many times i cried myself to sleep due to the acne which if it was just a simple pimple or blackhead that is one thing but as i have gotten older , my acne seems to have grown to sometimes the size of a nickel quarter and not just on my forehead but all over my face and on my chest and back one of the biggest issues is that the acne forms but with no head to it and hot do n't seem to help that much so i picked this up to try it wow , after using it 4 times already i noticed a big improvement i had one that was like the size of a quarter and already it is about penny size or less i am happy the heat does get hot but not hot enough to burn i did notice after the first time that i had a couple of small bumps appear due to the heat and the drying effect from this device i am looking forward to see if this device really does help keep future breakouts from happening and give me clearer skin either way , this device is worth the money for happiness
5	you guys this is no joke first of all it 's a really cool product to use it looks feels very high tech , but the ingredients are very simple and organic and it works ! ! ! it has a great cooling effect , but the results are really lasting it makes you look wide awake !
5	overtly onyx is an incredibly beautiful shellac shade very , very dark blue with gorgeous shimmer one of my favorite shellac shades
3	the color is lovely the application brush is fine quality however , the product does not suit me it stars to actually flake off after a few hours of wear it is not as durable as their eyeliner , not on me anyway
5	it 's nail polish it was unopened , it was the color i wanted , and it arrived relatively quickly what more can i say \?
5	my hair is starting to thin on top i have some volumizing shampoo that works well but sometimes i can still see too much scalp when i finish combing my hair i sprinkle a little bit of the toppik and it covers all the scalp and makes my hair look fuller well worth the money
5	love this color and this brand wish it was in a form arrived very fast from seller and very pleased with butter london nail products
5	have n't used it long enough to evaluate this color i have had this same product in a different color which i did n't see available , so i hope this will work well too i loved the product and besides staying on me all day , the product lasts and lasts , as well or better than other similar products , and though expensive is a real bargain , imo
5	my husband loves this and i enjoy it when he wears it pricey for our budget , but plan to keep it 's worth it
5	i'm in love with the beautiful and rich sent this has you need the tiniest bit too clean your whole body it lathers up huge and feel so luxurious and even though i really love the scent in the shower i also really appreciate that it stays in the shower and does n't linger after so i can use any perfume that i want i 'll definitely be looking into other products with this sent
5	this is a great product and i use this everyday ! pevonia has a lot of folks who come up with the perfect blend that suits everyone ! thanks and keep making this ! love it
5	opi you 're making me love purples
5	this is truly a lip moisturizer that works ! my lips feel like silk when i use bioelements lip moisturizer my only problem with it is with the price of 20 at the time of this review , but i am reviewing the product and not the price however , it does work , is n't greasy , sticky or heavy , stays put and lasts i recommend it
5	love it came fast to will buy more
4	my wife is making me use this \( i am 54 \) because she says that overnight my skin seems to dehydrate to an extreme level i'm not accustomed to wearing any type of moisturizer and i did n't want that feeling on my face all day , but it 's not bad it does n't feel greasy or slick , however by mid day my face \( especially my forehead \) is shiny and i can wipe the oil off with my fingers so i started using it at night and it 's working out much better if i'm not mistaken my face even feels better when i shave , like the shave is smoother because my skin is more supple and not dry if this is what they call , i'm in
5	essie is a great polish brand i 've never had problems with the length of time it lasts it does n't chip easily either this is a perfect color for winter , spring , or summer its simple and clean and looks great with a coat of glitter on top i love it
5	hydration is just about the best thing you can do for your skin , along with out dead skin cells so your skin comes in fresh and glowing i particularly appreciate the ingredients in skinmedica products that work if you use them faithfully over time this one is particularly good in the winter , but excellent all year round to keep your skin healthy
5	i have been wearing this for about 6 months now , and it is my daily go to adore the color , love how long it stays on , obsessed with the matte ness of it , and it has such a pleasant smell when applied i have bought this 3 times already in this shade alone so good \)
5	this is a very nice color from essie it seems to be a winter color to me and i have it on right now it is a very deep purple with a brown tone to it almost coppery essie polish is always easy to use and has very nice colors
4	i got this for my husband this is basically a designer version of axe body spray the bottle is bigger and contains a bit more product than axe sleek can and comes with a cap to protect the nozzle aerosol fragrance can go on light or you can use a heavy hand the fragrance lasts all day everything is as you would expect it to be if you are considering buying this , do so only if you already like the fragrance if you are considering this because you like the original eternity , know that this does not smell anything like the original eternity it 's heavy on the patchouli , musk , and vanilla notes reminiscent of chocolate or coffee and spices we liked everything about it except for the fragrance but that is because i received this product to test and review i was not familiar with the eternity now fragrance and was expecting it to be like the original eternity fragrance \( which we both like \) calvin klein should have just named this fragrance a completely different name using the name eternity is a bit misleading , imo if you like eternity now , you 'll like this but because i do n't , i'm giving this product 4 stars
3	what i like i like that the razor is adjustable and has settings setting 1 is the mildest setting giving the least amount of blade exposure rotating the razor head will allow the head to raise exposing more blade for a setting up to 6 the sound that the razor makes as it goes over whiskers is the shape of the razor head creates an the sound of whiskers being cut open areas of the cheek are a pleasure to shave , and this razor right through definitely cool looking , and effective what i do n't like shaving under the nose the razor head is huge , and that makes it difficult to get to tight areas such as this i 've cut myself while trying to shave under the nose as this is where the design is not friendly , or effective i have to literally pull my nose up to shave my upper lip the large head also affects shaving sideways and has cause a few nicks the handle is smooth , which becomes quite slippery once wet with soap there is no i still use it in my rotation , but it 's definitely not the most practical razor i own , and not my favorite
4	this four masque set claims to eliminate the of traditional mud in a jar applications unfortunately , i found it tricky to peel off and apply to my face , as the mud tends to stick to the clear backing and you have to poke around to make it adhere the way it should yes , it 's less messy in that it does n't drip into your eyes or mouth , but making it fit the unique contours of your face requires a bit of effort once i got it , i really liked the odor and the cooling sensation i felt pampered and after i rinsed it off , my skin felt very clean however , the effect does n't last and for the price , it 's easy to use up a box quickly but it 's good as an occasional treat , especially if you have very dry skin
5	wow , this is great stuff ! i was going to try and still give part of it as a gift , but hey , we 're keeping it i 've used the 2 and 1 shampoo and cleanser that is so mild but also very thick you do n't need to use much to wash your whole body my only negative about this stuff is that it does n't have the traditional baby scent i love that scent but the scent is n't bad very mild and goes away the waterless cleanser stuff is fantastic cleans with no water i even tried it on my son 's hair \( he 's 17 years old yes i said a teenager \) and it worked great it did n't say it was for hair but it worked for him i have n't yet tried the bubble bath it says it is sensory this is really great stuff high quality and would make a great gift
5	love the color , it 's lighter pink , just how i like it
4	this is easy to apply and will work for you well if you follow directions completely works well for everyone
3	i 've tried a few different products from the dermablend line and have to say i 've been somewhat disappointed they are n't anything extraordinary , and do n't do much beyond what full coverage foundations and concealers do this product is solid and comes in a jar with a scoop you remove a small amount , warm it up , and apply the color was a good match for me skin , but although i took the less is more approach , it highlighted every pore and imperfection i tried it again with a primer first , and it looked better , but still not something i could use on my whole face it is also not full coverage , as it did not completely cover a small red dot i have on my forehead i would recommend buying this only if you have young , smooth skin with no visible pores otherwise you 'll look all cake y and weird
4	a beautiful bottle which is important to my wife as she keeps all her and classic perfumes in a display on her bedroom dresser she applied some the minute it came in the mail and we both loved the scent our children all thought their mom smelled wonderful a blessing as some of her perfumes do not meet with their approval at that moment , of applying the perfume we were completely happy and satisfied with the oribe about 30 minutes later i asked if she had washed it off or what happened to the perfume it had been applied to her throat and behind the ears , and a touch on her wrists however , the scent was about gone in that short time she added a touch of the perfume in the same places and that wonderful scent was back once again the effect lasted a very short time in less than an hour it was barely detectable for such an expensive product , the lifespan is way , way too short to be recommended
4	if you 're accustomed to creams , lotions , and powders , this interesting foundation formula the company calls it water canvas will surprise you it 's spongy and springy if you can imagine that have some little sea they use to even out their skin tones , this could be it use a brush \( synthetic bristles are less likely to leave you with of foundation and bristles in the product \) or a sponge to apply this foundation patting and building up layers of coverage will work better than trying to sweep it across your skin , because it is dry rather than creamy i 'd say it requires a bit more time and skill to apply well than other formulations it gives you a natural look and a powder finish you wo n't feel it after application the packaging is great an airtight , lock tight lid makes it easy to carry and good for travel , though there 's no mirror the company makes a travel compact with mirror and you can use this product as a refill for it the product is made with wholesome ingredients it 's hypoallergenic , fragrance free , and cruelty free , and boasts sunscreen , though it seems as though the coverage might be too light to really protect
4	i'm quite pleased with this product for my mild rosacea i apply it to my nose and other reddish areas it rubs in easily and has just a very slightly greenish hue then i put on tinted moisturizer over my whole face , and my skin looks great it really tames the redness and lasts all day i like it because it 's not too thick or greasy as well
2	nothing special it feels like t gel shampoo , only smell better
5	i have fine thinning hair i used two other products before trying toppik hair building fibers i used a color spray aerosol and a brush on powder i did n't care for the aerosol spray because you had to be so careful not to get overspray on your clothes the brush on powder does work for small areas , but my hair continued to thin and it was time consuming to cover the top of my scalp this powder was suggested by a sales clerk at a beauty supply store it seemed to work better and was easier to use if i had a choice , i would like not to use any product , but i do n't want my scalp showing so i am very happy to have a product like this i started purchasing from amazon and found the product more reasonably priced amazon also has a pump that screws onto the toppik bottle and you can direct the powder better to the areas where you need it most i use a little hair spray to help hold it in place i found the medium brown covers my scalp better than the light brown and blends better with my hair color and highlights i would be lost without this product one negative i do n't think can be avoided , is the powder can make your hair look a little dull at the roots , but the alternative would be the appearance of thinning hair i order the refills and re use my container
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	i'm a bit leery about primers these days i made the mistake of using a silicone based primer with a water based foundation , and it was a holy mess ! if you ever find that your new foundation is pilling up or only lasting a few hours before it disappears , it might be because your primer and foundation are n't soul basically you use water with water , and silicone with silicone how to tell \? check the ingredients list bliss mad about smoothing primer is silicone based , and works nicely with silicone primers \( look for the cone or words at the top of the description the products with the biggest concentration are listed highest up in the ingredients list \) you should also be aware that this primer contains titanium dioxide , if that 's a concern for you some people are sensitive to it here 's bliss 's ingredients , taken from their website active ingredient titanium dioxide 6 90 inactive ingredients cyclopentasiloxane , isododecane , glyceryl , peg 10 dimethicone , polysilicone 11 , , water , methicone , lauryl polyglyceryl 3 , cyclopentasiloxane , prunus \( peach \) fruit extract , vitis vinifera \( grape \) seed extract , oenothera biennis \( evening primrose \) root extract , officinale \( jasmine \) extract , seed extract , ethylhexylglycerin , phenoxyethanol now to the primer it went on with that silky feel you get from silicon products spread nicely , and my silicone based foundation worked well with it very thin and lightweight , which works well for my skin type i did n't have any problems with it \( but be aware , my skin is very and is n't at all sensitive ymmv \)
5	i work out several times a week , and since i do n't have particularly oily skin , i have been spraying my face with the la roche posay as a way to get rid my excess sweat , especially when i'm on the run and do n't have time to shower needless to say , it works great in this manner and gives my skin a mist my only quibble is that the metal bottle is not made for travel , it 's a home use product that 's full size , but i would buy the smaller version if available otherwise , this is a nice product that can be used by anyone who a lot or needs something to help remove excess makeup it 's gentle on the skin and feels great
5	beautiful light blue color ! !
5	my first bottle of butter london nail polish is a gorgeous mauve pink shade with pearlescent metallic overtones the bottle would n't open until i saw that it was sealed with a special sticker and you have to pull off the cute rectangular top to get at the real top that unscrews to reveal the brush clever ! also no leaks the polish goes on like the name states , like butter i used o p i natural nail base coat , then two coats of the polish , topped off by o p i rapid dry top coat because the butter london polish self levels very nicely , a rather quickly done manicure looks like a much more professional job the long , specially shaped brush for the polish worked really well to apply it i definitely will be trying more shades of butter london !
3	if you have relatively flawless skin and seek mild cover without spf protection , this product might be for you it goes on easily , has no detectable fragrance , and does n't seem to pool in wrinkles for me , with my aging and somewhat blotchy skin , it did very little
5	if you want your manicure to last , then use this ! ! my manicure lasted a week without a chip , and that is on my natural nails can last past a week with minor touch ups !
5	we have three massive make up cases just for cosplay and , since i have been the designated make up person for the last five years i can tell you that nothing beats dermablend in fact , the entire lower tier of one of my huge train cases is just filled with their products you can buy cheaper but you 'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural you simply cannot buy better ! this foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks beauty marks \( i even had one person with a star shaped tattoo near her eye it easily covered it \) and , what i really love is how once i have a clean canvas \( one perfectly created by dermablend \) , i can layer over regular make up \( or more extreme cosplay make up \) without pilling , rolling , or smudging i can even do fine line work and the lines go on sharp , and stay sharp ! ! i cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as dermablend finally , dermablend lasts until you remove it we have used this for full days of photo shoots and panels and it just stays put ! \( it 's best to use a make up removing cloth to gently remove it and then move on to a light cleanser like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href liquid neutrogena facial cleansing formula 8 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 liquid neutrogena facial cleansing formula , 8 fl oz a nbsp with a clarisonic this seems to really do the trick ! \) dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream i have never had one subject have any sort of reaction ever ! that says a lot about these products ! please , do not be put off by the price a little goes a long way for most everyone i have used dermblend for years ! it is the best , bar none !
4	pretty spring color , goes on a little streaky next time i will try a light clear coat under it first
5	i use this on my curly haired daughter it does a good job of refreshing her curls it also does n't have a strong smell
3	this polish is watery way more so then the other colors maybe its a fake i do n't know i should have bought in store
4	i really like using this as a blush i use my finger tips to apply it and it goes on very smoothly without feeling too greasy or oily the color looks natural on me \( i have pretty fair skin \) and it stays put for most of the day i also tried it as a lip tint and found it less successful that way applied to my lips it actually is oily and does n't stay on too long the compact is a nice little size \( i do n't have any other jouer products , but it does have the ability to with them so you can create your own makeup kit \) it usually takes me a few tries to find the right side to open it on , but that could just be me
5	best spot treatment , ever ! ! it does have a strong scent but it fades after a few minutes my blemishes are normally about 50 smaller by morning
5	beautiful color !
4	i have a skin condition that causes my skin to feel like it is sunburned when i saw this , i decided to try it granted , i was n't using it for its intended purpose , whatever that purpose is , but for what i did use it for , it does cool off my skin especially the back of the neck where the burning is the worse as a matter of fact , if i spray it on an area that is n't burning , i do n't feel the cooling once it 's dried however , on the back of my neck where the skin is burning it stays cool so i'm guessing that if you have a sunburn , this will help make your skin feel better , as it is making my skin feel better that is the plus side the not so good part is the smell i do n't tolerate odors well , but as one reviewer wrote , it really does smell like old , old lady perfume and reminds me of some of the cheap avon perfume another thing i do n't like about it is that it makes my skin feel slightly sticky and as a 50 year old woman , i really do n't need to shimmer \)
5	my wife and i love this stuff our skin drinks this stuff up like milk goes on easy and disappears quickly our skin feels silky smooth after shower and using this formula smells clean and is not greasy love this stuff
4	i was honestly skeptical when i ordered this fragrance because it is listed as floral scent i usually choose fragrances which are more fruity or spicy however , i was pleasantly surprised to find this more of a fresh fragrance with a slight fruity undertone i wore it today and got three compliments throughout the day i had a hair appointment at 4 , and my stylist noticed i was wearing a different scent i was very impressed since i had applied the fragrance at about 9 this morning , and she was still able to distinguish the scent at 4 this afternoon her comment was , i like your new scent it smells fresh since she smells many different people 's fragrances throughout the day , her review of this fragrance very well received i really believe this is a scent most people will like this particular set is nicely gift boxed and comes with one full sized 3 0 ounce edt spray and two 25 ounce edt purse sprays , which makes it great for gift giving personally , i am going to keep one purse spray in my handbag , and the other in my overnight bag where i always keep toiletries packed and ready for my next trip
3	the triple oxygen face mask is everything ! out of the four products , the mask is the only one that made a noticeable difference immediately my skin is rather oily and shines rather than glows but the mask made my skin radiant , \( for a few hours \) the body butter is a bit greasy , but it smells nice the oil free face wash is typical nothing special at all and the cream did little
5	this nail polish color is everything ! i love shellac and have been using it for the past 5 years this polish lasts for 2 weeks and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone it does require a uv lamp which can be purchased on amazon as well this is a professional grade nail polish that can be done at home with ease i have purchased multiple bottles in different colors and will continue to do so ! this is a must buy ! ! !
4	i was n't expecting this to be so good i did an amazing make up the other day to go out to a special event and tried this as my foundation it comes with a small plastic spatula \( and first it looked weird , but then i understood \) the product itself is creamy with hard texture it spreads easily providing great coverage to skin the color fitted perfectly for my skin tone i ordered the medium beige one i had no idea that l'oral usa is to this , and and very satisfied my make up lasted longer and with no need for touch ups it was amazing i do believe the container is smaller than expected , but for this great results , i figured there is no need to apply too much product on your face it covers pretty well and then you can smooth and finish with powder
4	lovely rosewater spray with a light consistency that gently sprays on and provides a refreshing , natural scent while up and hydrating your tired skin the product comes in a small spray bottle containing 1 7 ounces of fluid its small enough that it can fit in your bag or pocket with relative ease and a few small spritzes is all you need to your skin
4	dermablend is a professional cover creme that works beautifully to obtain flawless skin many women have acne , scars or different pigmentation on their face and neck this creme was designed to cover up those issues , when used as directed if you are going to use this as a sunscreen , apply 15 minutes prior to sun exposure and reapply every two hours to benefit from the 30spf if using as a foundation , you only need to apply once and if you also use the setting powder , it will stay put without smudging for 16 hours the golden brown shade is the second of four dark shades it can be used as a contour creme also
4	it is no better or no worse than any dry shampoo on the market it is easy to use i do n't find it gives my fine hair any added volume or lift it does smell nice , but i doubt if i would buy it again too pricey
4	this is labeled as a serum , which means it is a heavier moisturizer that is generally worn overnight , rather than during the day interestingly , i did n't find it to be very heavy at all in fact , i would say that the consistency feels more like a light hand moisturizer that 's okay , except for the fact that the bottle is super small , so if you use the amount of product that you normally would use with a light moisturizer , it is going to run out very quickly it has a light scent that probably wo n't bother anyone the bottle looks nice , with the of product inside there is some text on the back that is impossible to read tiny , low contrast , light purple lettering good luck with that hopefully it does n't say anything important , like do not expose to skin \) because of the lightness , this might make a good moisturizer to carry in your purse , for use after washing your hands , for example unfortunately , the cost is so high as of this writing that i ca n't imagine anyone using it for that overall , the product is okay , but not very intensive , and the cost is stupid high sean logue , 2016
5	butter london rocks even if they do not have a thinner ! this makes one 's bl nail polish last even longer !
4	this is a nice eyeliner , it has a waxy formula that goes on smoothly and blends easily it is pretty similar to my go to eyeliner which is the nyx on , glide on , stay on' liner however , this eyeliner does n't quite have the staying power of the nyx liner and it also costs more than twice as much the brown color is a reddish medium brown , perfect shade for like myself or anyone with really pale skin that looks awkward when using black or really dark brown eyeliner
5	l love this color ! i used it as the tip of a french manicure with cnd bare as the main color it is so fun , perfect for summer or a frozen party !
5	i love this scent its never too overpowering like perfumes can be it is sweet and powdery , with a definate feminine twist
4	this is the first time ive tried dermablend makeup , and i was quite impressed with it my face has just about every variation in color you could imagine , from small colorful spider veins to blotchy freckles \( not the scattered across the nose kind the big age spots run look \) to too red cheeks it was actually kind of strange to look at myself in the mirror after applying the makeup and see my face with a single base color although it is a thick formulation and a little hard to put on smoothly \( a sponge is really needed \) , nevertheless it feathers out and blends easily at the hairline and chin it also blended smoothly at the few stubborn dark spots where i had to apply an extra dab it does settle in the wrinkles just a little as the day goes on , not sure that can really be avoided with a full coverage makeup all of the ones ive tried have done that , and none of them covered as well as dermablend i was also pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to wear i work at home and do n't wear makeup every day , and often when i do it the feel of it on my face bothers me all day with this one , i actually forgot i had put makeup on until i went to wash up that evening and there it was it stayed all day , yet washed off easily so far , i have had no problems with it irritating my sensitive skin if you are looking for a full coverage base makeup , i highly recommend you give dermablend a try
1	no better than sally 's no chip polish
5	i got the small version of this highlighter in a birchbox subscription a couple years ago and i used it every day for about a whole year so this stuff is dense as hell you barely need any for it to show up , and it 'll last you forever \( for everyone complaining about the size \) when my little sample ran out , i tried about 5 other highlighters before and getting this one again nothing compares i 'll have to come back and add some photos this stuff makes me look like i was touched by
5	i love this product , my skin is looking so much better since i began using it lines are reduced , pores clearer , skin looks younger , woot ! i got a great deal on it for , so glad i snapped it up ! i do n't use the body pedi brushes much , but have had good experiences with both
4	works well covering a red scar on my face required a few layers , followed by foundation makeup and the redness disappears lasts all day !
5	this is a nice portable contour palette with small mirror there are no applicator brushes that come with it the colors are very compatible with a fair skin tone when applied correctly i use the darkest shade only sparingly but it creates a nice effect it helps if you have decent brushes they go on smoothly and easily and wear quite well throughout the day i do n't demand perfection so i have seen no need to reapply it mid way through the day since this is a compact set it travels easily and lends itself to easy touch ups nice quality
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	my daily routine for about the last three years has been to use a paula 's choice antioxidant serum vitamin c oil , topped with nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href eltamd uv clear broad spectrum spf 46 1 7 oz dp b002msn3qq ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 eltamd uv clear broad spectrum spf 46 , 1 7 oz a i 've been hoping to find an all in one product , and i think i 've found it in this tizo product there are several silicones in this , which means it goes on silky and creates a smooth finish it 's also oil free non , and has ceramides \( which strengthen the skin barrier \) and vitamins c and e in it \( although neither the label nor the website lists the percentage of vitamin c \) it functions as a primer , which also saves one more step in the morning great product but i wish it just came at a cheaper price point update on 8 28 17 i emailed tizo to ask about how much vitamin c is in their product , and here is their response the vitamin c in the am replenish is a vitamin c ester and is less than 1
4	vichy claims that this bb cream does 6 things \( 1 \) illuminates instantly , which it does skin appears to glow when even a thin layer of this cream is applied that 's partly due to the titanium dioxide and mica , but whatever the reason , this is the strongest quality of the cream on the other hand , if you do n't like an illuminated look , you 'll definitely want to avoid it \( 2 \) hydrates i think it does , but my skin is so dry that i moisturize a lot before applying probably the best test is at the end of the day at which point my skin still feels moist \( 3 \) visibly smooths fine lines at the very least it does n't emphasize fine lines , which some makeups do \( 4 \) pores look refined i have small pores already , but i 'd say this bb cream minimizes them further \( 5 \) conceals dark spots i get no concealing effect at all none so , for me , it utterly fails on this claim \( 6 \) uva uvb protection this claim is absolutely true the significant amounts of chemical sunscreens that give this an spf 25 rating have prevented any suntan or sunburn every time i 've worn it unfortunately , on the two occasions that i applied it near my eyes , the sunscreens ran into my eyes and stung for over an hour so , i 'd say this vichy idealia bb cream delivers on 5 of its 6 claims here 's where the problems lie \( 1 \) the color range is narrow there are only two colors as far as i 've been able to discover , the light and the medium i tried both neither of them worked for me so , i combine the two and get a reasonable shade for my light skin \( 2 \) the cream has a fragrance a lot of reviewers both here and on say that they like the scent i do n't but it is n't so strong that i ca n't stand it over a short time , it fades \( 3 \) there is no coverage i get a bit of skin treatment and a nice glow from this , but my dark undereye circles and few broken capillaries are not if the coverage were stronger , the too light light and the too dark medium shades would really be a problem \( 4 \) there is no way i can use this anywhere near my eyes the runny texture and the chemical sunscreens make this impossible to wear either on my upper lids or undereye area the eye area is where i need foundation most , so i use a foundation like dermablend cream or l'oreal true match around my eyes and use this bb cream on my cheeks and jawline so , instead of making my makeup routine quicker and easier , this adds a step finally , i'm impressed that the formulation includes some really interesting ingredients i am especially intrigued by the saccharomyces black tea ferment
5	there are 2 facials per box , so it 's a really inexpensive way to get a home facial i have to say , i thought the treatments were a little bit harsh , and i was going to give fewer stars than five but i did the treatment last thing before bed , and when i woke up , my skin looked amazing i'm 49 and have pretty decent skin , but it tends to be dry , especially in winter this was great ! !
4	fast shipping , product just as described
5	exactly what i expected
5	call me a if you wish , but i have no connection whatsoever to this company i have reviewed several xen tan products and found all but one of them to be 5 star that is my totally objective opinion this mousse intense is my favorite of all of them , so i 'll call it 5 stars plus the mousse goes on smoothly , without a hint of streaking it smells heavenly if you like vanilla \( i love vanilla \) it gives a buildable , non orange tan that lasts for about a week unless you fail to exfoliate before use it dries fast , so if you apply it just after showering and before bedtime , it will dry during your short walk from the bathroom to the bedroom do n't expect any moisturization from this mousse it is a self tanner only if you want moisture , you will need to add it separately but if you want a natural looking tan , smooth application , wonderful scent , and fast drying , this is a great faux tanner !
5	great summer color
4	not the color i was expecting , but i love it anyway
5	delivered as promised and on time works great i love it
5	i love the product i have been using it for 2 months the product is expensive but i think it 's worth it
5	wonderful product !
5	i am in love with these 20 glycolic pads my skin is already looking clear and they use it with the skin which makes it even better
5	i wanted to try this product first before i wrote a review i bought the hot tools 1 1 2 let me say it works wonders ! i had bought a 20 bed head curling iron a week before this one and it was terrible ! did n't heat up hot or even curl this iron heats up hot ! i leave it on 280 degrees because i have fine hair and do not want to damage it and it gives a great curl and holds ! i recommend this product 100
4	not quite the color i was expecting a good color to match a single outfit , but not to wear for 2 weeks would prefer it to have a undertone , than so orangey
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
5	works great
5	this is the largest size body lotion i have seen from crabtree and evelyn , and the best value the jojoba has a nice scent , it smells clean and fresh i put it on after my morning shower , the softness and smoothness stays with me , just what i need to get me through the winter months ! thank you for making this new size
4	i had n't tried this particular cream before , but like the others i use \( skin strengthening complex , physical cleansing scrub \) , it is a fabulous product and leaves my skin feeling like velvet i also feel like these products help fight the aging effects of sun and environmental factors
4	the wand was pretty good at being able to get the smaller lashes , but throughout the day it seemed that the mascara would flake off onto my cheeks
5	i'm a shampoo junkie philip b 's peppermint avocado shampoo is a tried and true favorite you wo n't find me without it i even have a tiny travel bottle i wish i could rate this 6 stars ! it smells amazing , leaves your scalp tingly , and your hair feels nice 'n clean best of all , it 's cheaper to buy on amazon !
5	awesome a must for thinning hair , just sprinkle on the area and take fingers and hair a little and style as usual it is amazing this is a very light blond they also make a med blond that is great on light blond hair that may cover better do n't use too much it can make scalp itchy but you really do n't need a lot
5	borghese products are so italian they make you feel clean , beautiful , and i like to have fun when i shower and wash my hair i also do n't like to use the same products all the time usually , i like the basic nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dove beauty bar white 4 25 ounce bars in 14 count packages pack of 2 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dove beauty bar , white , 4 25 ounce bars in 14 count packages \( pack of 2 \) a nbsp but sometimes i want to use something different that 's when i use borghese 's di vita shower gel it has a wonderful herbal smell that reminds me of autumn it works great as a cleanser and leaves you smelling fresh it is gentle on the skin and foams up nicely i highly recommend it
5	i'm a guy with bad nails i'm trying to get better and kick some bad habits \( , \) this is a perfect thing to help it 's a perfect little grooming kit , that screams quality from the beginning , and looks like something you 'd want to give for a present pros this will last you forever i would have no worries about this holding up forever the parts are all extremely high quality the nail clippers fold flat , and are very innovative on how they come out and work it took me a moment , but i'm impressed cons it 's very expensive 40 per piece , if you look at it that way
4	all three of my little ones have mild , occasional eczema outbreaks and i'm always looking for the most gentle , non drying cleaner to use on their sensitive skin this is one of the better ones i 've found no \( or very light \) scent and leaves their skin feeling very soft and not at all tight and itchy the only drawback is the high price for a relatively small amount , but if it keeps my from having flare ups , it 's worth it
5	i'm very sensitive to scents i like light clean scents not heavy or anything else , this is the one and only perfume i can wear without getting a headache or sick of it smells just like fresh clothes , clean and light , great for summer ! ! ! if you hate perfume like i pretty much do , try this one , this might be the one and only for you too !
4	i picked up a few sunspots at the beach this summer , despite trying to keep protected with sunscreen , and this took care of them within a couple of months or so granted , they were fairly new and not extensive , and i'm not sure whether they would have hung around without treatment , but i feel fairly certain this product at least helped them disappear more quickly and completely this does make a good base coat for makeup i 've experienced no irritation other than mild tingling on the very first application , and that 's possibly because i also used an aha product at the same time also , i 've seen no breakouts that i connect with the use of this moisturizer finally , as with most products with spf , i assume this is protecting as claimed , but ca n't really verify
5	i love this product i can honestly say it 's the best top coat i have ever used my nails are thin and were always breaking i put a light color of polish on first and let them dry for about an hour and then used this the results were amazing like salon quality amazing and i was able to open a can of soda without breaking any just be sure you do n't layer it too thick and let all coats dry completely , otherwise will show up in the finish definitely recommend if you want to get great nails at home
5	this is a lovely crushed glitter red good for celebrating ! i found myself just at my nails after i applied it gorgeous ! \( just do n't wear base coat or it 's nearly impossible to remove \)
5	good
5	like other mario badescu products , the liquid is thick but not greasy at all when you apply it to your face it has a gentle soothing effect and i found my skin feeling soft and well hydrated after a day running around in the hot , humid weather though the bottle is small , a little goes a long way and it 's the perfect size for traveling i ca n't imagine going on a plane without it
5	my hair is starting to thin on top i have some volumizing shampoo that works well but sometimes i can still see too much scalp when i finish combing my hair i sprinkle a little bit of the toppik and it covers all the scalp and makes my hair look fuller well worth the money
2	i had high hopes for this product but i have n't been so impressed i use their blush and love the pigmentation and clever packaging in this case i find the highlighter really hard to even discern on my olive tan skin i use a liquid highlighter otherwise and that adds the perfect highlight , whereas this just ends up as a smear if i add more not worth it maybe it works well for light skin tones
3	it 's a nice product , but a little to light for me polish stays on well
5	calvin klein 's obsession was an instant classic since its introduction in a blend of citrus , flowers and spicy gives this cologne a soft fragrance that makes a statement without being overpowering although it could be used year round , i prefer wearing it in the fall , winter and spring seasons i would rate its longevity to be moderate to long lasting , depending on how much you spray on it is the perfect fragrance for professionals in any field or age group
3	this cleanser has a nice scent and it 's easy to lather and rinsed off well it did not take off all my mascara , which was a bit of bummer i have very sensitive skin , but this wash did not irritate it at all it did leave me feeling slightly dried out , so i did have to apply a bit of extra moisturizer after using this overall , it works ok , but not the best
5	love love love my agave healing oil treatment ! and so does my hair ! this is by far my favorite hair oil treatment following washing and conditioning my hair , i pump it into my hands , rub them together , then slather it into my hair for a manageable lovely look my hubby is using it as well !
5	excellnt transaction , great product !
5	this is a thick cream that has what it labels as face spf 60 it does feel good on my face and hands where i spread it for sun protection it is water resistant it states this resistance will last for 80 minutes it does itself completely by saying that in order to protect yourself , you need to apply this and wear long shirts , pants sunglasses and a hat for me it works as a good sun protection , but i seem to have a skin that does not burn very easily the best thing is that is a cool non greasy or oily sunscreen
4	south korean beauty and skin care products are all the rage but are they really worth the hype \? this mud mask left me with mixed feelings using the patch technology so popular in medications , it features a two piece mask the box contains four , each individually wrapped i am not sure who they used as model for these but one size most definitely does not fit all if you have small eye , a long nose and a big mouth in an face , well you are in business application is a bit tricky the mud \( actually volcanic ash \) infused mesh fabric is covered on one side by white plastic and the other a clear plastic wrapper remove the white and place over the face then peel the clear side away , pressing into position once you separate the mesh for the backing , it goes pretty quickly the mask has a light , pleasant lemony fragrance leave on at least ten minutes i left it on for twenty so that it dried completely peeling it off was a snap then rinse face with warm water there was not much residue and it rinsed off cleanly and easily there was no tightness or dryness and i experienced no negative reaction from this product i must say that after a session my skin looked and felt terrific pores did seem minimized and my skin looked fresh , smooth and healthy it felt soft , moist and smooth frankly , i wish this stuff came in a jar the mask itself was clunky and although i do n't mind looking temporarily like one of those gray that people for the sake of beauty , the mask need major to fit the contours of my face i also wish they had an unscented version that said , the ends justify the means and the results my objections to the method it is not perfect and you will most likely need to perform surgery on the mask and still some areas will remain untouched by the mud , but overall , it was effective
5	use under my moisturizer i 've had fewer breakouts , clearer and brighter complexion , soft smoother skin and diminished the look of wrinkles i recommend all of pca 's products
5	in a short period of time i have noticed that my skin tone is starting to even out and feels smooth i use them 3 4 times a weeks
4	nice bright color a little more difficult to apply to due lightness of color
2	i am still breaking out i keep using until i run out not sure why i even purchased this thumbs down pca
5	very happy with all of my billy jealousy skincare products this is another daily use product that never leaves my skin oily or greasy it 's perfect for my combination skin
4	the color was a lot darker than i had expected it reminds me of sally hasen 's brick wall , which i already have
4	i live in the desert and my birthday is in a couple of weeks and my face is beginning to show it i have very fine lines near my eyes \( baby crow 's feet \) and smile lines i have only used this once and it felt good going on its not greasy , but does n't feel like it dries my skin out it has a fine that works to exfoliate the dead skin surface i am fairly sensitive to scents and thankfully the one in this scrub is very mild my face and neck feel really soft after using it i look forward to seeing what it does long term and have taken before pictures i will update my review with an after picture and follow up comments on the product
4	iluminage precise touch permanent hair remover seems to work , at least by thinning unwanted hair the device is easy to use first you shave the area you want the hair growth to slow from it should be noted that this product is not intended for facial hair removal on men it can be used on a male or female body , and certain areas of a woman 's face , but not on a man 's face so i am assuming it wo n't work on course hair the instructions do not say that , but i am putting two and two together here you use the device once a week for 6 weeks , which ends up being 7 treatments so again , shave the area you want hair growth to slow on choose your setting preference on the device making sure the two silver bars touch your skin , move slowly across the area of skin you are targeting so the lights flash over the area you trying to rid of unwanted hair just keep the device moving , do not stop you can glide over the area 2 or 3 times per treatment , but apparently no more female facial treatments are a bit different , as the area you are trying to rid of hair is smaller so you are to use a motion with the light , again 2 or 3 times for a treatment the device does n't promise 100 hair removal , but 94 over the course of 6 weeks my husband is noticing a less hair growth on his back \( yes , his back \) , which is a good thing a very good thing beach around the world will thank you next summer so from what i understand from research on this item , it is made to have 150 , 000 pulses , and then wo n't work anymore that 's a lot of pulses probably more than we will use in our lifetime the only reason i mention this is that it may not be good for someone trying to use it in a business , using it on lots of people but 150 , 000 is a lot of pulses for the money , it 's worth buying a new one if you burn this one out fyi and food for thought we 'll give this to my hairy daughter when she comes home from college for the holidays she 's obsessed with hair on her arms , and already shaves them i 'll make a follow up post to update readers on how this works for her
5	is the greatest dryer in the world , it can get hot or cold makes your hair shiny and bold forget what youve been told buy it before its sold
5	excellent product my skin is smooth and soft with no dryness i use it over a neocutis serum which seems to work very well
5	this is one of the premier products form the obagi skin care line it is luxurious moisturizer that will add radiance to the skin it is intended for use at night and has a tons of goodies when it comes to the ingredients shea butter , soybean avocado oil , mango oil , allantoin , panthenol and couple of peptides this is a gold in a bottle product that will bring incredible benefits for anyone with dry or mature skin but it will also benefit anyone who lives in extreme climates with too much heat or cold that can dry out and damage the skin this cream can help slow down the aging process by providing skin with nutrients it need to convenient packaging does not take much on the bathroom counter and it can be easily packed for travel
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	love it , no more words needed
4	this is an easy to use trimmer that is more precise in cutting the tiny hairs between my eyebrows than my old one it has an interesting light feature that works well in low lit situations but i would have appreciated a magnifying attachment , as i find that sort of thing more helpful \( i mean , how many times would i trim my eyebrows in a dark place \? \) for less than 20 , it 's a decent model albeit the casing feels cheap and i worry that it would break easily if i dropped it that said , it 's lightweight , runs fairly long on one aaa battery , and it 's good for travel so , no real complaints
5	is clinical products are typically sold at medical spas i purchase them online this cleanser is superior quality and comes in a generous bottle that can last for up to 6 months is a single person is using the cleanser twice a day \( morning and evening skin cleansing this product contains willow extract , sugar cane extract , chamomile extract as well as lipids it also contains two kinds of acids that help with cleansing properties acid \( which is also used for treatment of \) acid is unique because in traditional herbal medicine , c asiatica has been used in an attempt to treat varicose veins , chronic , psoriasis , minor wounds , , and to encourage according to the american cancer society , although at least one study of cells showed reduced cell growth with , available scientific evidence does not support claims of its effectiveness for treating cancer or any other disease in humans and \( \) acid which is a and inflammatory agent i would this product for anyone with sensitive skin or rosacea because of the soothing and anti inflammatory active ingredients
5	great !
2	i'm pretty disappointed by this machine a real microdermabrasion treatment is when crystals are across the skin 's surface , picking up dead surface skin cells along the way the crystals and dead skin cells are quickly sucked up through a different tube in the same wand and go to a bag this machine has a little metal crystal cake inside the wand the suction pulls your skin into the want tip and rubs it against the little cake thing , which basically scratches a layer of skins cells off and that off onto a little cotton pad just below it i'm not so sure this is good for your skin i could be wrong , but it 's way more abrasive on your skin than a real microderm treatment at a spa \( and i have about three sessions a year and i exfoliate daily at home \) it seems to me that the suction helps plump up your skin because of the way it sucks up your skin into the wand i'm not willing to do this to my skin any longer i do n't recommend the machine
5	i love it
2	usually , i do n't care about the packaging of a cosmetic it 's what inside that counts but this is the worst packaging i have ever encountered in over 20 years of wearing make up specifically , it 's got a weird sort of design where you 're supposed to unscrew the cap and pump out the foundation however , in my product , the tube was bent out of shape and due to being tossed around in the mail , a ton of foundation managed to pool up in the cap what a waste ! also , this stuff is very thick and does n't wash off easy probably due to the high concentration of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide even with repeated washings of hot soapy water , it stayed on my hands and on the bottle and this is before i ever applied it to my face ! when i finally put it on , it was okay it was thicker and darker than i expected although it was not nearly as dark once i applied it to my face it is a decent , medium to full coverage foundation with a good spf but that is all it 's nothing great and the horrible packaging is a drawback i got this as , so i am not out any money however , if i had paid for this , i would ask for a refund
5	great ! ! ! i will use this seller again
5	very good
5	this is a great colour goes on a little darker than what it looks like in the bottle , but still a beautiful lavender and of course essie quality , so dries really fast without streaks needs at least 2 coats for it to be opaque though !
4	i am a minimalist when it comes to make up i always have been i have n't been that interested in make up till just this past year , when i tried ipsy i have never used a make up setting spray before and this one seems fun to try i was over at the lake this past weekend and i decided to try it i basically used just eye shadow , blush , tinted moisturizer , powder and mascara i sprayed the make up setting spray and it seems to hold up just fine all day , even when i was in the water when i washed my face after swimming , the make up did come off , so it did n't completely wash away in the lake so that is a plus there is no odor with this spray , not that i could see i also did n't see any tint to it \( and was not expecting to see a tint \) you only have to use it once and it seems to help the only problem i have with this is that it is rather expensive for a small bottle i know there are people who can afford this , but for me , i would have to decide whether or not i want to spend 24 for it it depends on how long it lasts too if you like make up and live somewhere it is hot and muggy , this might be a good investment for you i enjoyed using ti and it does seem to help keep my make up in place
5	the first two things i noticed when applying this eye cream were the cream felt velvety smooth that it had a bite to it the bite , or burn if you will was not severe but was very unexpected it went away almost as fast as it came on aside from that oddity i have experienced no negative side effects for about two weeks i only used this on one of my eyes to see if there was a difference when i became convinced that i was in fact seeing a very very slight improvement plumper fuller looking skin around my aging eye , i decided to start using it on both eyes again , on the other eye at the first application i experienced the burning , but again it went away within mere moments this eye cream feels absolutely wonderful in comparison to my other brand which went on very wet aka watery thin my highly sensitive skin while prone to breaking out is also prone to dryness this makes things pretty frustrating , but when it comes to the thin delicate skin around my eyes , the more moisturizing the better i expect this will last a very long time , as only the amount is needed , making the price seem more realistic i'm thinking this should easily last me a year or longer i will be sure to update my review if i feel there is anything relevant to report good or bad as it things stand now i'm very happy with this eye cream
5	this is a lovely brush , both to see and use kabuki brushes are designed to use to apply loose powdered make up this spreads the makeup evenly this is made in china the handle is wrapped with thin wisteria vine , making a secure and attractive make up i am frustrated that there is no clue as to what the soft brush is made of traditionally the brushes used animal hair , but many today have synthetic bristles this does say natural and is very soft it almost reminds me of rabbit hair the brush does work with my pressed blush but it does spread wide and with a of powder it creates a natural look as long as the powder does not get on your clothes still its a lovely addition to any makeup set
3	dermablend quality dermablend quality is the biggest issue is finding the shades that match skin tones best another concern is depending on where and how used creasing is possible and needs touchups during the day
5	this is a great mask to use the next day after using the aztec clay mask
4	this is tinted facial sunscreen which is a great idea but at first try it is thick it reminds me of the old fashion cake make up but the key to this product is to apply sparingly and rub in well i am fair with blue eyes and the color is good for me as with all sunscreens re apply throughout the day i recommend this product but i do wish it was creamier
5	pure decadence light and not oily sinks into skin leaving it quite soft and well moisturized smells sweet and all at the same time worth every penny not clogging my pores best part of my nighttime routine 12 17 updating to say how in love i am still with this it is truly a holy grail for my red , sensitive skin i have also purchased the eye cream
4	this mainly works by exfoliating skin with extremely fine microbeads in a tan gel base cleanser , which help to keep small hairs growing out free from in growing and pores clear it has a definite masculine scent that is rather generic , but pleasant , and very subtle just a hint of scent remains on the skin after it is washed and dried it does n't strip skin , but leaves it feeling clean it does n't take much at all for the face , but if using this product for more than the neck and face , expect to burn through a tube rather quickly an exfoliating glove might be a better option for body use
5	essie does deep pink better than anyone we know ! this color is perfect for the beach or the bistro go for it !
5	i have \( or should say \) had callouses on my heels and the front ball of my feet but the dead sea essential foot cream has worked what i would consider a miracle it is not greasy feeling and really has soften my feet i am not very good at remembering to use lotions on my feet so therefore have only applied this a few nights at bedtime it is amazing and i will be telling my friends all about it
5	you ca n't go wrong with hot tools !
3	truly , there is nothing special about this under eye product that would me to pay the 30 it costs it is light and does not cause skin irritation to sensitive skin however , aside from that i did not find the product to be effective my recommendation is to get a good night 's sleep and drink plenty of water
5	mild but thorough very good
4	my wife likes this lacoste pour elle sparkling eau she tells me the scent is a little strong but does fade over time the actual scent she likes and so do i slightly flowery jasmine scent with a bit of spiciness certainly not a generic scent somewhat unique the actual bottle is also attractive elegant looking with high quality build and of course the cool lacoste alligator on it we have the 3 ounce bottle which is pretty large at current price of 76 on amazon it certainly appears reasonable price for a nice perfume and large size tip i did see some lower sale prices on the 3 ounce bottle via google search \( one sub 50 \) if you 're not sure get the smaller size bottle for less overall 4 star rating from me in consideration of price value
4	my husband has a heavy beard and he likes this shave gel he found it gentle and soothing it an adequate amount of and wholesome applied to the facebook moisturized without leaving a greasy residue
5	i do n't usually wear eye make up but i really liked this product i can just smudge it on and voila eyes are done ! i agree with the reviewers who said it makes a difference to use quality eye products like many people , i 've used the low end drugstore products , figuring it would n't matter but it is different easy to apply and use the color worked for me as well
2	this was not as purple as it looks here if it were more cool toned gray i would have loved it too this color is best on darker skin tones it looked odd next to my fair skin
5	elemis pro collagen skin care system goes to show that expensive skin care formulas sometimes deliver the bang for the buck that they promise ! i have many different brands and types of oils from many product lines in my makeup and skin care collection , and elemis is the one i reach for each and every time the oil arrives packaged in a high end , nicely colored , aesthetically pleasing bottle , which comes with a convenient dropper the smell is very light and airy and i always take a second sniff , or more , since one sniff is not enough most important , of course , are results i apply creams on my facial and neck area and dab \( a little goes a long way ! \) a few drops of oil around my eyes i must say , the oil is better than my vitamin c serum that i used before elemis i can see the difference in my crows feet , wrinkles and fine lines around my eyes and the area nicely moisturized without any indication of dryness best of all , it doesnt even feel oily , instead it feels smooth and pure everything about elemis is cruise like and spa like quality through and through apart from my eye area , i found one additional use for toe nails ! i know it sounds bizarre , but i dab the oil on my ingrown toenails every night , and the oil performs wonders my toenails feel so much softer and no more pain ! amazing ! plus , no animal testing and a ingredients , this oil it out of the park and achieves five stars without any hesitation
5	i love the minty flavour it feels very soothing and i would imagine it has a slight effect in case you get a cut a half press is enough to cover your whole face it provides a smooth generous foam that makes your shaver glides with almost no friction at all
5	great product for the control of rosacea much cheaper than i usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product i was buying straight from the pevonia site
5	i started using this recently and absolutely love it it allows me to wash my face and eyes at the same time
4	glides through hair without snagging , gets nice and hot and stays that way it 's also nice to get two replacement springs with the iron that is always the first thing to go on these things and then they lose all effectiveness because the jaws wo n't stay closed swivel cord is nice too
2	although i'm in the target age group for this product , i was disappointed to find it too greasy for me to use during the day it made my skin look oily and unwashed , and at night , it just felt uncomfortable , even though i only applied it to the drier parts of my face this is a little bottle of product , but since you only pump out smaller amounts , it will probably last for a while there is a subtle fragrance , but it 's not unpleasant i intend to use this on the backs of my hands and other non face areas , and see if there are any skin improvements
5	seriously a beautiful color ! a must have for polish lovers , and especially nude polish lovers !
3	it 's a quality office but not as great as reviewers made it seem i was slightly sad after my first brushing experience with it i was expecting more \(
4	when the makeup arrived it seemed really pink i was not sure about it i was surprised by how smoothly it went on and it looked natural i only used about three short of the brush on each cheek it did not make me look like a little girl playing dress up with her mom 's make up also , i like the idea that i could stack all of the make up if i brought a bunch of different products by this line the back of the blush one has side tracks and grooves to stack with instructions on how to stack them
4	living in florida , sunscreen is a very important essential to have i admit i do n't put it on half as much as i should be \( nor do i drink water as much as i should \) ! the reason being i do n't like the way most sunscreen 's feel , especially on the face they always leave behind this chalky feeling and it feels like there is dried up clay on my face it 's just icky ! this suncreen does n't do that too much , while it still gives me that slight feeling , it does n't make me feel icky and it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly the product also does do a bit of a job moisturizing my skin as i do suffer from dry skin \( probably from not drinking water \) while i do like this product i think the price point is a little too high for it it 's hard to find products that fit and match everyone 's preferences and it 's even harder when a good product is n't within your price range hopefully i can soon find a drugstore \( and a much more affordable \) brand to do the same thing
5	in the summertime , especially , i do n't wear foundation as much as in the winter when it 's hot here , it 's hot and humid i found the dermablend intense powder to be a good , effective product for touching up skin imperfection areas while it 's also ideal for full face coverage , for me just being able to camouflage areas around the chin and cheeks or wherever i want a bit of coverage is ideal i find that the trick is to apply with the sponge , then use a medium brush to blend the edges when i use it this way i have light ivory skin , and the color choice works perfectly for me i usually only apply once when i first put makeup on but if i were going out for several hours i 'd take the compact with me in case i feel a need to touch up
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
3	i like the consistency and feel of this product i'm just not sure how much good it really does my skin , overall not sure i would buy it again
4	initially i thought that this would not be useful because it is solid black , which can look way too hard on those of us with over 50 eyes but since one can draw a very fine line with the pencil , this the fact that the liner is solid black it allows one to line upper and lower lids very what i do n't know is whether the fine point will stay fine if it becomes blunt , that is that because i see no way that one sharpen the pencil or refill it
5	best hand cream ever one at work , one in my purse , one on my nightstand , one in the kitchen winter staple for me
5	daughter was thrilled i could order this for her
4	i loooove the color of this nail polish it matchs exactly what i wanted it to match the only downside is that it chips fairly easily without topcoat , so that is necessary
4	this is pretty it was n't the hot pink i expected because it has a hint of orange in it but i am very fair
5	this product is amazing ! it 's an fantastic spot treatment that really works ! !
5	i really like la roche posay products for my skin i have combination facial skin my forehead , nose , and chin are somewhat oily especially when weather hot outdoors or i'm working physically non stop this facial toner works great for my oily area 's and keeps it dry all day long it 's a spray of water , salt , and zinc that 's lightweight the spray is more of a localized spray so you 're able to target specific areas , and you do n't even know it 's there works great
5	saw this nail polish color on pinterest and i searched the stores trying to find it and then i saw it on here and i was a little skeptical buying nail polish online but it came brand new and the color is a dead match !
5	great colors ! when used with my led light , it lasts 2 weeks
5	my favourite shade of red !
5	exactly what i need !
5	when you sniff it straight from the jar it smells like cheap cologne but once you put a on your hair the fragrance is more subtle and pleasant , with that minty smell of other bath products more importantly it does n't leave your hair feeling too stiff or sticky , like other products i 've used if you use it sparingly , it gives your hair a light hold and a nice shine my only qualm is the packaging it 's easy to mistake this paste for the real thing and i'm afraid that if i leave it on the shelf where a child might see it , she will mistake it for an elmer 's glue product and ruin the stuff i get the manly packaging \( no nonsense , kind of in celebrating the basics \) but it feels gimmicky to me and i wish the package would more clearly state what it 's meant to be used for \( instead of just saying paste why not add a second line saying hair pomade \? \) otherwise , this is a quality product
5	this is the best i 've used and the one i reorder
4	love the color quality good as all opi products
5	have n't used this yet but it smells so amazing !
5	i wash and dry my hair everyday and it does get dry you can use this on wet or dry hair and keeps it conditioned and gives a nice shine
5	this is a gorgeous color \( zoya colors always draw me in , though \) it is maybe a touch darker than the product photo \( but the photo definitely covers the metallic shimmer \) i am wearing this on my toes right now i 've had it on for a few days and it still looks wonderful \( granted , my toenail polish usually lasts a long time \) it went on smoothly and was n't drippy the brush is a bit narrow but that really helps with edges and smaller toes this was opaque in two coats and it dried quickly i put it on over a base coat \( blues and greens sometimes stain my nails \) and finished with seche vite fast dry topcoat it has a lovely shine when dry this is a five free polish \( as are all zoya polishes \) although my bottle was kind of old , this went on smoothly and was n't sticky or goopy this had some of the best performance of a zoya polish i 've used , actually \( and i have quite a few of them \) definitely recommended if you like the color
1	i love this color \( and many of essie 's colors \) , but the polish gets so many bubbles as it dries that it 's unusable
5	this is a great clay product i 've actually had difficulty finding a product that i liked \( gels , clays , waxes , etc \) since i 've purchased this one , i 've only been using this i usually use it to my hair , but it also gives a good slicked back to the side look i use the product with my hair slightly wet , but it also does a great job with dry hair you get a lot of good definition with this i very much appreciated the videos showing how to use it get a certain style this helped me to know that this product was going to be good this product lasts me around 1 2 months of daily use baxter has a sample of the various gels clays , which might be useful for someone who wants to try out the different kinds before buying a full jar https www amazon com baxter california pomade mixer kit dp ref sr 1 52 s it \? s luxury beauty ie utf8 qid sr 1 52
5	these pads are great they have a very nice minty smell and they also have a nice minty and cooling effect on the face these pads are on the larger size compared to the little cheap ones at the drug stores and grocery stores these do not fall apart and leave pieces of fuzz all over your beard area like the cheap pads do these come in a flip top container so they are perfect for your gym bag , carry on luggage or your desk drawer these are an a product from an a men 's line overall , a great buy and i will continue to purchase and use these
5	mixing and matching or using just one as a stand alone product wo n't give you full benefit of a skincare product , since they are formulated to work with used during another step of the routine with that in mind , in order to evaluate this product properly , i either purchased or requested through vine , the other pieces \( please see my review of the cleanser and radiant moisturizer in this meg 21 line \) i then used all three products faithfully twice a day , every day for 30 days i can tell you it works your results may vary \( after my testing period i tended to on the twice daily routine \) what i liked about this toner was that it was applied by spritzing it on the skin , the blotting excess off it has a very faint scent , and the bottle is designed for easy use it was and pleasantly refreshing , leaving my skin tighter and smoother i highly recommend this
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
3	i really like jane iredale products but i feel like they are not very durable i really like the smell of this blush and the fact that it is not tested on animals the color looks really nice on my pale skin the reason that i give it a three is because it broke off in the top after only a short time of use
3	the packaging is good the spray and the bottle is well made the spray works well i think this is fine as long as you do n't mind the overwhelming citrus floral smell it does linger for several hours after applying but at times it does loose it 's original smell having said , is this bad smell \? no but is it a good cologne \? probably not as the smell especially after few hours of applying is not as favorable as the initial burst of sweet citrus the asking price also weighs in and makes this a rather expensive cologne spray to own overall i rating this with 3 stars generously
3	not sure scott vincent borba is worth the hype results for me are similar but better in a much less expensive product i prefer not to mix powders before applying
5	the best eye cream ever i got a sample and just loved it and the price is great i have used so many expensive creams and this is better than all of them my concealer goes on so smoothly with this product and it really does smooth out the lines i can use this product day or night i just use a good shadow base and get no creasing and under eyes stays nice and moisturized throughout the day i have used all kinds of different eye products that are far more expensive and the best results i 've gotten is combining this eye cream with peter thomas roth laser free eye serum
1	didnt work for me moving on from mario badescu tried multiple products nothing worked !
5	love it
4	i think these are good nuface serums but the packaging needs improvement there are three serums which i 've used each on their own and also combined two or three of them at once there is the nourisher , a superfruit stem cell serum that suppose to repair , nourish and protect the skin the smoother peptide complex is suppose to smooth fine lines wrinkles and slow aging process it 's too early to see a real difference but my face feels moisturized with these products and not other lotion is needed these product vial containers are so small the , really need a revision , and i do n't like needing to mix three different products the dropper feels cheap , like my early chemistry play set maybe nuface could create a simple pump dispenser with three that could insert these serums into a single pump
5	the best eye cream so far my wife loves this not cheap , but well worth the money for the quality of product highly recommend
5	it really does stay on a week , even with hands constantly in water
5	this is nice it does impart nice shine and it does detangle i 've tried about a dozen philip b products through amazon over the past couple of years and like them all yes i 'd buy this product again
5	this is the best hand cream i have ever used i started using it in the 90 's when i worked in the cosmetic industry stays in the skin and actually moisturizes
5	i like that what this line of products does for my skin , especially during this really dry fall , when my skin is super dry and flaky \( yeah , it 's a lovely time of year \) so many products are either geared towards the younger crowd and have harsh ingredients \( to tame oily skin \) or towards the and filled with acids to \( supposedly \) get rid of wrinkles my skin is so sensitive , i need just a gentle cleanser with a simple toner and this is perfect i like this bottle , too , because it 's pump action easy to get the perfect amount out
2	this candle smells like your old aunt 's guest room you know the one who uses scented in the drawers and feeds you expired for tea
3	if you like a tip to mascara wand , this could be the mascara you would want it does take some getting used to , but i think it is safer when first applying to lashes however , after working with the mascara , i did not find it really was significantly better than other mascaras i have tried and used throughout the years i did not put a primer on first i wanted to see if it to lashes , and it did without primer it did not provide better overall volume and i was disappointed i applied it initially and reapplied it twice more i did not not notice a significant difference i washed it off easily and tried it again , using a different technique of on first application and then working the tips of the lashes that worked somewhat better but not at this price point , i think that there are better mascara products out there with heavier coverage and no clumping this did not clump but it did smudge later after second application on the plus side , my lashes did not itch , and this is a good one to use safely
5	loving my pmd ! bought these because i'm extra sensitive on cheeks
4	pros 1 light 2 creamy but not greasy 3 mild refreshing scent 4 all you need is a nickel sized dab spreads over entire face and neck region 5 moisturizes and soothes cuts 6 clean and stylish packaging cons 1 small tube barely 2 5 oz 2 expensive \( 25 bucks for 2 5 oz whew \) overall 4 stars buy it use judiciously so that it lasts for a long time the product is really very good even if the price is not
4	this concealer is great , it really does cover those dark spots or blemishes i have not found another concealer that lasts as long as this one and actually keeps what i want covered
5	great product for the control of rosacea much cheaper than i usually pay for this product and it works every bit as good as the product i was buying straight from the pevonia site
5	the color is even more pretty in person
4	the thin , narrow wand allows the mascara to coat each eyelash without an excessive application of product however , over time , the product builds up on the wand and it is n't scraped off sufficiently when you pull the wand out of the tube so you end up with clumping on the lashes to address this problem , i wipe the wand on a tissue to remove the excess product i have also rinsed the wand a few times under hot running water these extra steps should n't be necessary and are wasting a rather expensive product nevertheless , i like the appearance of my lashes when using this mascara , and it does n't bleed too much under my eyes throughout the day it also comes off easily at night with the use of a single eye makeup remover pad
5	this works really well in cleaning your face , getting dirt and makeup that are left behind by other cleansers i wo n't be going without it ! my skin feels so much softer and has stopped breaking out
4	boscia make up break up and cleansing oils have been my usual go to 's for the first step in cleaning my face each night , but this one from skin co is just as good all it takes is a couple pumps of this wonderful cleansing oil in your hands \( no cotton balls or pads are necessary \) , rub directly onto your face and eyes until the oil turns milky , then rinse with warm water every trace of makeup , dirt , and grime will be gone and you are left with silky smooth skin that is n't the least bit tight or dry feeling this cleansing oil works especially well if you have oily skin since oil helps breaks down other oil , this will clean your face without over drying it , which for many cleansers is a big problem that only leads to more oil production by your skin if you use products like benefit 's they 're real mascara or kat von d 's eyeliner , then you will really like this cleansing oil as it does a fantastic job at breaking down waterproof smudge proof sweat proof makeup that usually requires a lot of elbow grease and heavy duty makeup remover to take off i have terribly sensitive allergic reactive skin \( that is bane to my love of ulta sephora so many sites \) that reacts badly to half of the products i try , but thankfully this cleansing oil is gentle enough that there were n't any issues i do wish it did n't have the extra colorants , though the only downside to this cleansing oil is the cost though the directions say to use three or four pumps , you can easily get away with only two which will help this last a little bit longer this is one of those investment products that some will find worth it because it is so gentle yet so effective that it allows you to skip another step in your skincare routine second face washing , heavy second application of face cream due to tight skin after washing and therefore \( hopefully \) eliminates the need for buying and using another product
4	this is a very nice set it has items in it that go in your diaper bag , to use for in between bath time messes , as well as bubble bath that is very fluffy making bath time lots of fun ! my little one has sensitive skin , but all of these products worked very well to cleanse and moisturize her skin without drying it out too much it has a nice , subtle , neutral scent that is very nice the gift set itself would make a lovely gift as well overall , very nice skin care set
4	i do like this product although it wo n't replace my current product even though my current product costs over three times as much the reason is that i have sensitive skin and it seems slightly more red and i have a few breakout spots now i cannot say for sure , however , that this redness or those breakout spots are related to this purete cleanser to its credit , when i use it and follow it up with the vichy mineral water , i sometimes forget to apply moisturizer because with the vichy routine my skin feels already moisturized the product also makes my skin feel tighter and firmer so i do n't have visible pores in combination with the mineral water this seems to be a good product for most but if you have exceptionally sensitive skin you might want to try it as a small purchase first and then decide for yourself before buying more
4	smells great very lightweight and good for blonde hair i use a pencil size eraser amount and this bottle will last me forever however , i do n't notice any difference between this product and some of the 10 or 12 hair oils ive tried probably will not order again simply due to price
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	i have only been using this for a few days , underneath my regular spf 15 moisturizer , and i already notice that my skin is visibly brighter i have fairly sensitive skin , and i can slightly feel the acid working in this corrector cream , but it 's not irritating to the point of causing redness or real discomfort i am in my late 40s and have pretty good skin , but it 's showing signs of aging i chose this even though i do n't have dark spots because it says it brightens and evens out skin tone so far , so good i would call this a fluid , not a cream it 's thin and lightweight you do n't need very much
5	i love this shampoo ! i'm a red head so i have to be careful with what products i use so as to not strip my hair of its color i 've received numerous compliments on how well my hair smells after using oribe shampoo i also love this shampoo because my hair still feels soft even if i do n't condition it
5	this is a nice scent , it has a citrus like scent does not have the chemical smell some seems to have recently the scent is not overpowering \( 1 spray \) , but last a long time my wife and daughter both commented that they liked it the first day i tried it it has an efficient mister type sprayer , so you do n't get squirted , but get a controlled and consistent spray each time you press the sprayer this bottle will last a long time , unless you overspray which i highly recommend you do not
5	love this essie color ! essie polishes are some of my favorite nail polishes they self level better than any nail polish i have ever tried they coat very well , and for the majority of the colors essie nail polishes are very opaque they dry very quickly as well this color is a very cheery , vibrant sky blue almost completely opaque with only one coat one of my all time favorites !
5	i received the light medium bb blur by la roche posay the color is a bit too dark for my skin tone which is more of a light ivory with yellow undertones that being said , i gave it to my daughter to use who 1 \) has t zone oily skin she gets break outs on her forehead and chin and is always looking for a product that wo n't contribute to her oily areas 2 \) she has a slightly more olive tone than me , but not by much and she said that she could work with the light medium but wants to try the light as for the coverage \? the product itself goes on beautifully it feels almost silky but not oily it is excellent for all day coverage my daughter loved the way she could her blemishes without any caking and without any added oil just remember to powder lightly and set with a spray and you 're good to go for hours ! we are going to try the light color and post an updated review after using for a longer period of time as of now , the product covers blemishes and sets beautifully recommend !
5	love this use it after i shampoo with davines shampoo
4	this is definitely a mini gift set in a big tin box i have used all the products in the box and actually think it helped to reduce a few very fine lines around my eyes my skin just seems smoother there i like the serum and facial lotion the best and my face felt moisturized for hours after applying the body lotion moisturizes very well , but there is n't much of it so i use it mainly on my hands i'm not saying for sure that this will make you look younger , maybe i just ate a lot of the night before it 's weird , but i 've noticed my facial skin looks better a few hours after eating a load of but it 's a nice surprise nonetheless all the scents are nice and not very strong
5	awesome !
5	i wear lots of brown clothing and eye makeup so these were perfectly complimentary shades it is easy to apply and feels fine when applied with no irritation of heaviness i was wearing it outside on a very , very hot day and the perspiration around my eyes caused me to wipe them quite often reapplication was needed a couple of times i do not believe under ordinary conditions reapplication would be needed
5	this is now my favorite clarisonic brush head it is soft and gentle but effective at exfoliating and that works well with my skin type i do n't like abrasive heads that feel like i took sandpaper to my face what 's funny is i just wrote those thoughts out and then when i looked down the product page at the various heads offered it listed this head as gentle but effective and those were the same words i used too so i say this head is exactly what it says it is
5	this is a lovely skin care line and everything i 've bought of theirs has made me very happy this gift set is no different i took it with me on a trip recently the cleanser was perfect , just mild enough to keep my skin from feeling too dried out and tight the serum went on smoothly and my skin seemed to just eat it up and the moisturizer was exceptionally light the serum seems to be the only full sized product in the gift set and i used up the cleanser and cream more quickly but that 's okay they lasted long enough to get me through my trip and home again i would recommend vichy 's products to anyone looking for quality skincare products without having to dig too deeply into your pockets
2	i guess that i do not have the sophistication to appreciate a 18 can of mineral water that has 10 1 ounces in it i used this product as directed and nothing it is refreshing to spray on your face when it is clean , but i think that i can get the same effect by taking a spray bottle and using some good american mineral water i am not sure why the french mineral water is so much better than mineral water made any place else , but for 25 cents for a 20 ounce bottle compared to 18 i think that i will buy american mineral water i am also a believer that your skin must be hydrated from the inside out you can spray the entire can on your whole body , but if you have not put inside your body , it is not going to do any good my entire family gets together on the 4th of july for a pool party and i plan to use the vichy spray to keep me cool while im sitting outside in the heat by the pool and plan to drink lots and lots of water to keep me hydrated
5	another great color from opi , girl friend loves it
5	feels and smells great ! obviously not a necessity at all , but my house has no ac , and when i wake up in the morning , i'm immediately hot again after washing my face , so this is super refreshing to cool off with after i apply makeup the mist is very fine and sprays evenly across my face
4	skin feels like new
5	i have tried other dermablend products and while they work well , the shade was never right for me this stick matches my skin tones very well i took this for a large discolored acne scar on my back once that worked really well , i also tried this stick on a dark spot on my face perfect smooth coverage ! the stick is so handy , i can carry it in my purse and gym bag it goes on evenly with no pilling i do think the trick to your dermablend experience is getting the right shade and tone product for you im so happy i tried again as i can really see the benefits now
4	love this product although it does seem like the formulas have changed
5	love this ! keeps my skin clear and moist !
5	i love this make up , it has exceptional coverage and the ingredients are safe and non clogging
5	beautiful color ! it 's actually a bit on the natural side of red , too very nice the angled design of the tip makes for easy application and it felt nice and smooth as it went on and it did n't dry my lips out i did n't need a lip gloss as a top coat , and that 's a rare thing for me the staying power is excellent after drinking a i still had a nice red color to my lips i did a reapplication after eating a meal but there was surprisingly enough still some color on a good four hours after applying this lipstick is odor and tasteless and i quite appreciate that it did not bleed nor feather this is most definitely a quality lipstick and i 'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting the perfect red
5	although far from using organic ingredients , vichy makes up for it in nice quality , awesome fragrance and very good value since a little goes a long way this nice sized body and hair shower gel is rich but does n't leave skin sticky or feeling like a film just clean with a nice fragrance the smell is clean and refreshing not heavy or floral very nice product
5	my fine lines are vanishing !
3	the finish on this is amazing i love the blurring effect and it 's not greasy or shiny it feels good on my skin but the shade is kabuki , yo i'm a very pale woman with very little melanin , but i had to order the medium tone this particular shade will be good for only the of
4	i keep trying products that say they will reduce under eye puffiness , and so far none of them work , so i do n't have a lot of hope for this but , on first try , it seems to maybe be working \? i will update this review on further testing the product comes in an interesting twist top container that reveals a pump one pump worth of cream is plenty \( possibly too much \) it goes on smoothly and quickly , but it leaves a bit of a coating that can pill into white clumps if rubbed or if you put too much on , so be careful with that it 's not a good look so far , i'm pleased but this better be effective at this price hoping for the best i will absolutely buy more if it works !
5	i love this oil i have given it as gifts it can be used on wet or dry hair adds shine and great control for the frizzes ! the oi scent is delicious you will not be sorry with this purchase
3	the product is creamy and helpful in moisturizing the eyelids and area around the eye the dispenser is clever but more prone to blockage than a simple plastic tube the liftactiv does slightly reduce puffiness and wrinkles on a temporary basis , from what i can tell frankly , consumers here are paying for fancy packaging \( with instructions printed inside the box \) and the of french mineral rich volcanic water the price is too high for results obtained however , one thing i really do really like is that it has no fragrances added , so the smell is very minimal that 's important to me , especially for anything i'm putting on my face
5	calvin klein eternity now deodorant has a pleasant scent that i love my husband wearing it keeps him smelling fresh through a variety of activities since it is alcohol free , it is comfortable to wear and does n't discolor his clothing
4	great gift my wife loved it and it was free ! ! !
5	hi ! love this brand
4	my 15 yo daughter has a porcelain peaches and cream complexion and so far has been blessed with less acne than i had as a girl when this kit arrived the breakout she had was on her forehead they were tiny red spots she started using the kit and liked it she reported and i saw no signs of irritation summary as you know when it comes to acne products , results will vary my teen used this product on a fairly large breakout of small red spots on her forehead they were not the large or even medium size zits that most people think of when someone says , acne i mention this because it could be that this product works better on some of acne than others on the plus side nothing in this system irritated her pale , delicate skin the system stopped the breakout and seems to have kept any more zits from appearing on the downside , the system did n't zap the zits it may have their decline but they did n't vanish over a period of 3 or 4 days a big problem for teens is that 3 steps is a lot in fact my daughter would only use this once a day twice was just too much conclusion i 'd say there are good results but not miraculous ones for us it might have to do with the type of breakouts she has i wo n't buy more for her because of the time factor and i do n't want to have to ride on whether she keeps up with this or not other teens have better stick to it so it would be better for them
4	erno laszlo is a name i immediately associated with marilyn i'm pretty low maintenance and not real in luxury skin care or make up , i do n't have a set beauty routine , but i do like trying different products and then incorporating in the things that work i want to that at this price range , i am probably not their target customer i have never used a skin serum , so i was intrigued by the promises of moisturized , toned , smooth skin also a plus that it contains no petrolatum , sulfates , mineral oils , colorants , parabens , and phthalates directions suggest gently apply with fingertips and blend upwards and from the middle of face , to the neck and dcollet \( neckline \) this requires about 3 4 pumps of product it dispenses as a light , clear oil gel that has a faint citrus scent , and seemed to dissipate soak quickly into my skin i have not seen visible results , but i can feel it on , hopefully working !
1	no hold , not happy at all with this product
1	update so i 've had this hair curler for 1 5 years now honestly , after the first 3 weeks , i stopped using it not because it was heavy not because i was worried about damaging my hair but because people told me my hair looked terrible ! the curls do n't come out natural looking yeah , they 're curly , but there 's a weird where your hair goes from straight to curly i wanted the entire length of hair to be curly so i used it as close as possible to my scalp as all the instructions tutorials said it still leaves a weird straight area \( about 1 5 2 from your scalp \) and then this weird curl starts it 's not a round big bouncy soft curl it 's a tight , , , uneven curl that looks lifeless i was so excited that a curl actually would stay in my hair but the curl is so ugly that it 's not worth it i'm sticking with hot rollers and big barrel curling irons from now on if anybody wants to buy this from me , i 'll sell this to you cheap only used for 3 weeks so sad that i spent so much on something i used for 3 weeks \( old review i got mine and checked it against online tutorials teaching people how to decide if it 's real or fake i think mine is real it works well but i realize that your hair has to be really dry for the curls to be actually curly i had taken a shower and let my hair air dry for a day i figured that was okay , but it 's hot and humid right now and i noticed my curls \( using the highest heat setting and the longest set time \) were limp i had to dry my hair with a blower dryer and then try again then it worked quite well ! one thing i noticed is that the babyliss miracurl i got had a grey felt patch at the center of the curling mechanism \( whereas online , it shows a plastic circle with rings on it \) i think the computer image online \( even at the babyliss website \) has the circles whereas most people who have posted pics of their real babyliss \( bought from verified sellers \) have the grey felt so just wanted to mention that in case people were worried i have stick straight asian curl that got two over two weeks and still was straight afterwards seriously ! i curled my hair about 4 hours ago and the curl is still there and looking great despite it being crazy humid and hot ! this thing is awesome ! \( though i really hope i'm not damaging my hair with the heat ! \)
3	my first impression of the crabtree evelyn relaxing body lotion is that it had a strange but good smell i was n't expecting it after a minute or two , i did actually find it relaxing , but maybe too strong at first after it drys the smell is quite soothing the lotion itself is n't too greasy but did n't moisturize my legs quite as much as i had hoped , especially for the 28 price tag it 's winter , so i 've got major dry skin after a little while , i have to either suck it up or apply more the presentation of the lotion , bottle and label , is great pump works well , and has n't had any clumping difficulty at all and i 've been using this on my legs for weeks i'm not too happy with the ingredients \( lots of parabens \) in the lotion , so probably wo n't be purchasing this when this bottle really ca n't get over how soothing the smell is though !
5	love the color ! it 's a great autumn color because it 's a great mix of pink and red looks even better with a coat of grapefruit sparkle on top
4	the smells is very pleasant and the hold is terrific not stiff but not too light and it 's a great value for the money the can is huge this is a little different then i imagined comes out almost mousse like though not quite as formed so , you spray it at your roots but it leaves a white foamy trail that needs to be worked , or combed , in not a problem but i had imagined a clear liquid like some other root sprays i 've used i will definitely buy again as it the smell and hold are perfect !
3	ok this is so so cream it quickly gets absorbed in skin feels clean not sticky unfortunately i do n't see any of this hand lotion from drug store kind save yourself some money , pick up aveeno or something
5	the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me they earn being in a high end category in my opinion they do not seem to be scented or too chemical the jars , tubes , compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make ups i have many favorites among them , yet i believe they all stand very well on their own i hope it is going to be efficient to review all of the ones i know of here , and including compatible products along the way respectively 1 dermablend professional cover cr egrave me with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium

body make up \( spf25 \) 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out it smelled good too it was a truer color in my eyes , since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such also , some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly , and i liked them because they looked very ethereal , as with the pink violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light i have aged , and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product , one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture i especially enjoyed the blur ones now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here , including most recently , a lovely reddish brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put , a super mascara , another lip paint , some face tone enhancers , and a creamy to dry , light colored eye light , among others i am happy to see more high end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike , especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd 1 dermablend professional cover cr egrave me with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received , and it is my very favorite it covers my skin imperfections well my first attempt with it doesnt count , since i spread it very thin , allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through and i went out that night wondering why this was happening first of all , i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product , and second , i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have sun spots now i get it this particular cr egrave me has to be built up gradually for me and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all it is lovely if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover variable imperfections and when i apply it with dab it appears blended , and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make up can be it has alone a bit of chroma to it , as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) , in my opinion , unlike many other cover products i have used alone , they gleaming the light more than my other cover make ups , without chalkiness very nice the other purpose for me is that it has a \( 30 spf \) sunscreen all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have \( 25 spf \) or lower , and not my needed \( 30 spf \) that my dermatologist recommends she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage i score 1 , 000 here for this as well as the other qualities of this line the two colors i have are both medium ones , one a bit lighter , and both appropriate for me , especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here and i realize you may not have this type of a menu , but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) needed the wonderful cr egrave mes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder , and hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for this particular product is very fine , not grainy , and perhaps a bit creamy it definitely blends in well it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier , keeping the cr egrave me , bases , foundations , from smudging to hands , clothing in various ways , i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using them together dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades \( separate jars \) when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose a what i mean is that with the lighter shade of cr egrave me i was able to get the same look with the darker powder , as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr egrave me and a lighter powder altogether , with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match , thus prolonging my experience b also , with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face , and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks , nose , chin , forehead , i will carefully apply and lightly dust the medium toned translucent powders as described , allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion another plus 1 , 000 for me i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself pick your poison , as i have purchased some powder and cr egrave me blushes before today though you may find it unnecessary if you want the dimensional yet minimalist look i like to play with the powders , yet , when i am in a rush i will make errors , not being subtle , and not dusting before other products also , i am 62 , and my baggy under eye application errors are the most noticeable i get rid of this bagginess first i will use the powders now , especially with other lighter dermablend cr egrave me applications , or with the high quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) listed below and as well as their other foundations all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type , for example they are nice for a youthful complexion and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less noticeable pores , and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined in my case i am fine , and safest when i am well rested 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make up applications even with dusted powders it will make a difference it is that simple 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation ! ! \( 25 spf \) this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder , which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look yet because i preferred the variable built up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional cr egrave me , i missed something with trying this last as before i was too quick to judge i had applied it very thick and then i went out i thought to myself that is was mask like , yet nice moist cover not only can i variably apply this creamier product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers , i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look , then applying more product to the flaws this shade is a tad darker than the other shades of make ups , so as with the cr egrave me , and the powders , i may experiment with altering the look as in 2a win win win i also may add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray for a fresh stay with or without powders 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo ! ! \( no spf \) this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator , in other compartments while this color is quite dark for me , one quality , besides the products ability to render a thin cover layer , is that i do not see wrinkles really maybe the thin layer or the creaminess \? and the staying power , especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray also , i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck the darker color , applied gently is making a nice bronzer i do know that is stretching it i have n't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product , since this is a very dark color however , i am sure this might possibly work though this does go on thin , and i do not think a cr egrave me or foundation is needed to get a good look very nice camo cover product ! 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body ! ! \( no spf \) wow again i hadnt understood at first how i can use this , as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium \( my shade \) i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me , yet thick as i applied it and silly me ! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have ! double win ! this is a creamy roll up stick cover product which does the job , and which i wo n't feel shy about adding puffs of dermablend professional translucent setting powder so it doesnt rub off and i will use the appropriate color powder as well as described above in 2a this is a lovely product i love the idea of having a smooth body skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful , and long lasting dermablend professional leg and body make up however , im mentioning this first as im partial to a more natural , yet youthful , less unsightly look it is n't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed as the full body make up , yet it is the product i will use first especially during the day love 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) it is so nice to wear tights , stockings , or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses , and on ankles under pants above boots however , during cooler months especially , it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look , it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing i absolutely loved the look when i put it on and then darn , i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin this might not be problematic for you with full body applications , as for me on an occasional basis as desired yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother , and will please you i believe as i have expressed that this product renders a nice , airbrushed look , and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) this works fabulously it is creamy and it stays put it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover cr egrave me , because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends , even as i am in my home , shades drawn it covers very well , looks flawless with or without other products , yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line i have it in a tan color , and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin lovely plus 1 , 000 , and very smart very nice products indeed enjoy !
3	this shade is no longer available , so i was very pleased to see it on amazon although the seller is wonderful , there is a slight difference in color from my old bottle it is slight , so it is probably the dye lot , but with opi being such a well known trusted brand , i would have thought quality control would be better
4	these fibers are a good product for making a thinning head of hair look thick again i do however recommend the toppik hair fattener spray over this product also , if you are insistent on purchasing this item , i highly recommend purchasing the pump applicator as well it makes for the application process so much more effective and will extend the duration of the products use
5	i seldom wear perfume , but when offered this product i decided to try it i am not sorry it is a much fruitier and more flowery scent than the one i otherwise use very occasionally a musk oil i 've had for that is quite subtle and \( i think \) unusual , as it was custom made i could never have accurately described the scent as well as the perfume who likewise grabbed this offering they did remarkably well one reviewer agreed with lacoste it is tart and further noted the scent of bitter grapes , as well as the sensual and youthful nature of the floral tones that give this perfume a appropriate for the board room agreed like my musk oil , this scent requires only a dab to do the trick and lasts a very long while over use can also over power those around you , and is not recommended i would not pay 68 for this \( or any scent \) but i am very glad to own it and am sure the contents of the beautiful cobalt blue jar will last me for years
4	a few years back we got a veet device that used light to remove hair after receiving this device i was comparing them and noticed they were identical then i noticed the veet was actually the silk'n technology for their own machine \( essentially it \) the only major difference was color , and that this version included a nice storage case \( plus a separate battery powered trimmer \) in my experience these do work , but they will take some patience as well the light spot is small and it takes a few seconds for each flash you need to shave trim before using it , and you need to have lighter pigmented skin with darker hair , that allows the light to be absorbed by just the hair and kill it , from what i understand just like any other hair removal , you 'll have to continue to do it to get all the different \( hair lies , and then cycles \) good for small areas , and 50 , 000 flashes , the one has a bit larger area and can do 3x the flashes i believe , but still will need some patience
4	i have oily sensitive and acne prone skin i am learning that scrubbing it is not a good idea for me my skin will try to produce more oil and protect itself when scrubbed this is but i had to stop using it just to figure out how to handle my particular skin otherwise , i do love pevonia products
5	a must for me ! ! ! ! always need to have it to fill those not so hairy spots ! ! !
3	i have mixed feelings about this lip mousse in kiss me first of all , it 's darker than i anticipated just a touch darker than it appears on the lightest model on the see it on feature \( which is a very cool way to see how it will look on you ! \) i like the feel on my lips at first , but after about an hour , my lips start feeling very dry like i either need to reapply \( though the color is still holding strong \) or use some chap stick this is my first matte lip color , so i do n't know if that 's a of all matte lipsticks or not i also have a little trouble in the application it 's hard to get an even coat on my lips without applying a ton of the product the other thing i do n't like is how easily it wipes off onto other things napkins , cups , skin i ended up with it on the back of my hand , and it took a lot of scrubbing to get it off what i do like is how long it stays on my lips a morning application lasts me into the afternoon if this was a color i liked better and if it did n't come off on other things so easily , i would really , really like it
4	back in the 80 's , i had a similiar motorized skin brush it was great while it lasted now that i am middle aged with sensitive , oily , with occasional acne skin i thought i should try one again would this really help my skin look better , i wondered \? the box arrived very quickly this unit has a magnetic charging station with usb and an electric adapter as well , which is nice it comes with a face brush , body brush , cleansing lotion and a polishing lotion charging it was easy , the instructions say to let it charge for a full 24 hours i 've used the pre programmed facial and body cleaning cycles the face brush is very soft , i was n't sure it would do anything when i first used it but i was proven wrong i wish the face program was shorter for the forehead and longer on the cheeks , but that 's a personal preference my skin does look better after just a week of using it the clogged pores on my nose are much clearer and smaller and my skin looks a bit healthier the body brush is ok but i'm not overly excited about it i wish it were larger and had a bit more power to it i had a bit of trouble getting the heads off while in the shower , but i supposed they need to be that tight so water does n't get to the interior the cleansing polishing lotions that come with it are really great my skin is super sensitive and these did n't dry me out or make me red i would buy them on their own if available overall , i 'd recommend this as an excellent skin care tool !
5	i am new to dermablend products but this one is by far my favorite as it applies smoothly and does n't settle into fine lines but masks any imperfections and redness i applied it with a sponge and it stayed put through the texas heat and made my skin look even and i like the lightweight texture and the fact that is has sun protection of spf 25 i also love the upside down squeeze tube design and i would buy this once my bottle runs out
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i am happy with this product i do not see it taking off eye make up as with the blue liquid from the same brand though it really my skin after use when i had foundation on the solution cleans and tones , leaving my feeling like it is in perfect balance i believe if i use this every day i be pimple free for the i have to use a clean pore masque once a month , but this is perfect for me as an everyday maintenance followed by moisturizers , \( if you want to call them that \) , and then make up this is not drying or soapy , and is perfect for aging skin like mine i put it on a cotton pad and it feels lovely , being clear , and not smelling perfumey
4	this is really good for cystic acne does n't do a whole lot for regular acne , so if that 's what you 're considering it for i 'd go with the drying lotion or the drying cream that they offer in this line any cyst i had though on my jaw line or nice did n't stand a chance , literally makes a huge difference over night
4	really like it but it comes off easily
4	dries out pimples really well helps them come to a head if they have not yet i like that i can truly spot treat because since my face is dry from all the acne products i do n't to apply spot treatment anywhere but where i need it with creams although i try to spot treat it ends up being a larger area than the bump site i am very happy with it will continue to use it i do n't know that it works any better than when i use the proactiv sulfur mask as a spot treatment i will put a dab of that on a pimple before bed and it dries it out pretty good the next day and it is much cheaper since it comes free with the proactiv 3 piece kit but even so i bought this and i like it and still would buy it again
5	i tried this product after success with other pca products i use this cleanser in the morning and i use the pigment bar in the evenings i have done this for 6 weeks now and i can truly see a difference in my complexion my skin is less oily and much clearer i like this combination because it seems to combat my acne along with scaring from older scars i say this is a good first step into the pca product line i also utilize the a c serum , the true tone , and oil free sunscreen my skin has not looked better ! if you suffer from acne i highly recommend the pca line and this blemish bar is a good way to start building upon the line if you are weary of dropping a lot of cash they do have trial size intro packets ! !
5	this little tube of color correcting liquid is gold if you have red on your face , from acne , rosacea or even some broken veins , you will love this tube i am irish , scotch and german you know that is fair skin that gets red areas i used some of this on my areas of redness and now , no longer red i used a small amount and distributed with my finger easily on my face after that , you will need to have a foundation and then the setting powder i am able to wear this on my red areas by itself because i blended it in well it also smoothed the texture of the skin
5	i love this hand cream ! i work from home , and we have electric heat , so during these cold winter months , my hands become sore and chapped i 've been using this cream for about two weeks now , and have noticed that i no longer have chapped or sore hands ! i simply apply a small amount every time i wash my hands or do the dishes \( no dishwasher here ! \) and it works ! it really works just a little dab will do you my first application i put about a quarter size amount in my palm , and i thought i was going to hate it , because i felt greasy until the next hand washing , when i learned to apply between a dime size amount and a nickel size amount it works in well , and leaves no greasy feeling afterward
5	i did n't realize when i got this , not sure how i missed it , that it was a beard comb so i had a fit of when i got the package , but its truly adorable i used it on my to brush them down but i cant see how anyone who has a mustache or a beard would not love this , its sturdy , well made and a perfect mini of a great comb wonderful for many uses
4	i like jack black products , i use and like their lip balm for example i had some specific uses in mind for this product when i saw it come up in vine recently i began bleaching the dye out of my hair to go natural rather than let it grow out i 've been using argan oil very happily as a moisturizing treatment i thought the jack black epic moisture would be a great comparison item against the argan , but it has n't been sure , it temporarily smooths your hair it makes the ends stick together a little bit after you use a flat iron but as soon as i wash my hair , it feels the same as it did before the oil is n't any lasting benefit to my hair i have thick , curly hair for the record yes , it makes my hands and elbows smooth \( er \) temporarily but i have to keep applying it as a moisturizer for my face and neck , it just seemed to do light duty i need more than light duty , especially for the severe winter weather we are having on the plus side this did not aggravate my rosacea and did n't cause any zits to form they suggest a use for a beard conditioner softener i 'd never thought of that use but have to wonder if a man would enjoy this fragrance lingering near his nose mouth throughout the day this smells great the temporary effects it gives are nice , if you are looking for that it 's not what i needed and i would n't buy it , but i know there are a lot of men and women who need just this light kind of oil and would find it beneficial it 's a nice quality product , as i 've found most jack black products to be , but if you have heavy duty moisture needs this one wo n't be what you want update my husband decided to grow out a goatee , and he 's using this oil on his facial hair twice a day it 's helped soften the hair so that it 's not rough and
5	delivered as promised , new in box this is a fairly non irritating exfoliant my skin is very sensitive and i use it only every other day i ca n't imagine using it twice daily unless your skin is extremely oily if you use the pads that go along with this \( and i do \) get them from nordstrom you can get double the amount for the same price you would pay anywhere else otherwise the prices here for somme products are the best i 've ordered the serum and the cleanser but so far they have not arrived
2	this is a lightweight clear oil serum my wife has been using it on her d eacute colletage to try and erase some of the sun damage done in her earlier years she has been using it daily for about a month and has not noticed any real improvement at first she was using it on her face too , but got worried that the oily consistency would make her acne prone skin break out and switched to the c complex for her face instead the product claims there may be a slight tingling sensation when applied , but that continued use would remedy this , however she did not experience any at all the bottle will last for several months as you only need to apply 5 7 several drops to your face , neck and d eacute colletage for the price i would hope that it would work perhaps it only works on mild sun damage and aging skin \?
5	again the cnd shellac system is amazing and i will reccomend it to anyone ! it is so easy and nails turn out perfect every time
5	love this color , received many complaints
4	new to ji cosmetics and absolutely loving the line goes on soo light almost feels like nothing on your face i plan to change to this brand since it really feels good on my skin face the bad thing about this line very expensive and coupon this brand at checkout
5	it is a great neutral color it 's not quite the wear with everything mauve that i like but more of a latte beige it goes on streak free and i only need 2 coats
1	this perfume smells like cheap \( and strong \) shampoo or highly fragrant dryer sheets i sprayed some on a piece of paper , at the of aroma chemicals , and then put it back in the box about a half an hour later , i saw a friend who knows i love \( and collect \) perfume she commented , you smell like cheap perfume ! what she was smelling was merely a few scent molecules that had off the paper and stuck to my clothes this supposedly soft feminine fragrance is one of the reasons perfumes are increasingly banned in public places this fragrance was popular in the perhaps it 's been reformulated perhaps not either way , this iteration is simply awful to my nose
4	worked for me not as full face makeup , but as a concealer a little bit goes a long way and there is a learning curve , but once that 's out of the way , the product works great lots of choices of colors and i found going into a store and seeing them first hand works the best for me after that , i order online
5	the best
2	you definitely need to add more than 2 coats super sheer and my nail shows through i 'd resell it if i could
5	i am a huge fan of bioderma ! i just cannot get enough of their products ! this is something that i use on people that have oily or combination skin tone this does an amazing job of holding back the oil and filling in the pores if you have combination skin , i would use this in zones i usually put this where the person would have larger pores or oily areas , which is usually in the t zone i do n't think i could live without this in my kit !
2	while i liked the product initially because it does hydrate well something started to happen that i thought might be coincidence i started noticing eye bags i thought at first maybe i was too much salt , not hydrated , not getting enough rest , etc eventually i suspected it 's the nia complex and discontinued it the bags started disappearing a month later i tried it again \( new jar this time just in case \) to see if this was coincidence they began i tried reducing the amount applied , and even just using it only at night only when i switched to another product did the problem clear up for me might just be my skin , but sadly this is a no go for me btw i could not wear under make up unless applied at least 15 minutes before applying eye make up \( or it would smear off \)
4	an easy to apply silky feeling lotion according to the product label this ultra lifting and filling treatment contains blurring agents designed to help conceal imperfections , giving your skin a beautiful soft focus glow to be honest i did n't notice that my skin has a beautiful soft focus glow i did notice a bit of tingling after i put it on it claims to give your skin a youthful appearance but i have n't noticed any change although that may change after using the product on a regular basis
4	perhaps it 's a 5 star product , but i am deducting a star for the packaging defect my compact is missing the , which i'm sure would be helpful when i opened the compact , the metal dish of makeup out along with a large spring after looking at it and comparing it to the pics on amazon , i could see there was no way to grind the powder i opted to use my brush that i use with bare minerals to swirl lightly over the powders i was able to get great even coverage this way the product does a nice job covering pores , goes on with a nice matte finish and has a nice soft feel i would agree with the 8 hour rating it is lighter than other medium shades i would say it 's a bit lighter than bare minerals fairly medium it is good for pink and neutral undertones yellow and olive undertones would probably not go well with this medium shade
4	i 've been using this face wash for about three weeks now , and have been very pleased with the results it 's perfect for after a gym session , or a long day at work it definitely cuts oil and removes grime very well i often use it in conjunction with an exfoliating device , a clairsonic , for extra cleansing the ingredients list is impressive , and the fragrance is mild and natural i definitely feel good about using this wash i can see where this cleanser would be excellent for people with oily or break out prone skin i have regular to dry skin , and find daily use to be too harsh as a result , i only use this wash a couple times a week the drying results is the only real complaint i have about the product
5	shade 03 is absolutely amazing long wearing , truly velvety in texture , richly pigmented , and very versatile not only do i love it as an eye shadow but i 've been using it as a highlighter too i would definitely recommend this to a friend in the market for a high end shadow product that has many uses and is worth the higher price tag
3	i personally do n't like this either i use and love it ! this is super high shine , and i mean high shine its very very greasy and oily its not the look im going for the scent is fairly decent
4	great color but the brush is very tinny the color is beautiful but is does not last at all
5	beautiful color ! love cnd products !
3	i remember when dermablend was the name in coverage foundations i'm not really sure what 's going on nowadays or if maybe there were n't as many competitors back then i currently use nars tinted moisturizer and i find that my nars \( with concealer where needed \) works better than this foundation stick by dermablend i would say that even just the tinted moisturizer by nars works better the dermablend required quite a bit of aggressive blending as well as multiple coats to really get a look the foundation also felt very heavy on the skin it was one of those foundations where you felt like you had a mask layer i will say that even though it felt heavy , i did not notice any breakouts or oily issues afterwards
5	love the smooth , hydrating tingly texture !
5	great product !
4	tanning lotions are always a nice alternative to tanning beds and of course , excessive sun exposure the best thing is that you do n't need to apply a lot if you 're looking for is a soft , golden glow on your arms and legs if you want a darker look , however , it takes repeat applications and i found this a little annoying after applying a good amount of the lotion to my arms and legs , i waited for the darkening effect but it was too subtle i added more the next day and the effect was much better so , patience is the key to using this product i found it was n't greasy and does n't dry out your skin the smell is pleasant , not too chemical , which is a plus overall i was pleased with this product but it 's not for someone who wants to get a rich , dark tan in a hurry
5	this polish has so many different shades in it fuschia , coral , blue it changes in every different light , and different skin tones it wears very well and i love opi polish buying a refill do n't want to run out !
5	all is ok thanks
2	this gel does leave your skin feeling clean , but the smell is hard to get past it 's hard to imagine why this off putting scent was added to a product like this i used it on my own skin , but will pass on using it on one of the kids in our family
5	by far the best treatment for ingrown hair i have ever used not just for the face , it works quickly and easily i have never found something that truly gets to the root of the problem and heals , but this definitely does recommend 100
2	wow , for the price we were shocked with the quality of the actual pieces the nail clippers did really clip , the was okay and will not be used often and that left us with the nose hair trimmer that worked and lovely leather case cant say that is worth the price ! much disappointed and expected so much more from henckels
4	this is a pretty muted purple pink with an iridescent purple running through it it has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque
5	fun shade and opi is always the best
5	great purchase !
3	if you are considering buying this exfoderm forte product , i suggest you visit a skin care professional first get their advice and directions for proper use this product page does a poor job of explaining just what this product is supposed to do for your face the directions on the box and the back of the container advise you to use a pea size drop \( or a bit more \) and rub it on your face in the morning it also advises one to use a quality sunscreen while using this product questions i ca n't find answers to anywhere what kind of results am i supposed to see \? how long should i use this \? do i use it around my eye area , or avoid sensitive skin \? there are no tiny grains or particles in this lotion the lotion is soft , smooth and with gently finger motion will absorb into the skin at least that is what i experienced it is not greasy or waxy or heavy in any way at least that is what i experienced after reading many of the reviews here , i was more that a bit concerned that i would wake up and find my facial skin peeling that has not been my experience and i 've been using it faithfully for well over a week in my morning routine i have followed up its application faithfully with the obagi sunscreen my skin has not peeled my skin has not gotten red my skin has not dried do i see any results \? what results am i looking for \? who knows i 've gone to the obagi website and i 've done internet , and i still do n't have a firm grip on what i'm looking for if anything , i 've gotten a bit of breakout to the sides and below my lower lip and to the chin it could be caused by the obagi sunscreen , though , and not this exfoderm i'm going back to my previous routine biore charcoal bar which has some scrub in it , witch hazel spray toner and my favorite brightening serum \( with hyaluronic acid and a of other goodies in it \)
3	i know vichy from europe when i grew up and it was consider a good stuff \( maybe because it 's from france and french ladies are known for their nice skin , or not \) it was also rather expensive and sold only through pharmacies in us it 's available in most of the drug stores , but do n't let that fool you although they are nor pricey and are not load with a lot of high end ingredients the vichy products are very good this particular oil 's first ingredient is mineral oil sounds scary \? baby oil is pure mineral oil and it does good job in removing make up too than some , emollients and finally camellia seed oil and vitamin e performance it does remove make up well , but not 100 from eyes i still use eye make up remover on reusable cotton pads it did n't dried my skin and makes pore look very small \( most oils do jojoba , castor , etc \) it lacks some luxurious and antiaging ingredients , it is basic cleanser , will not do any harm but if you are looking for cosmetics and skincare without mineral oil this is not for you , and if you need more antiaging products you need some good serum after this
5	love this new color just got it in the mail today and already had to try it out it is a deep , dark navy with silver shimmer indoor , it almost looks black , but in the sunlight , it is like a deep sapphire it goes on easy and thin one coat gives even coverage \( i find some , like romantic , need two coats to look even \) , but i did two color coats for a darker navy i have been waiting for a color like this from cnd i am a shellac addict and buy a new color every month or so , and this was my first of the new fall 2012 line i am not disappointed i actually combined it with black pool tips for a must have black on navy french manicure i ca n't wait to try some of the other fall colors ! one hint with the darker colors , make sure you have a small touch up brush and some isopropyl alcohol to clean up around the edges , because they must be extra crisp to look good
5	the great thing is i had purchased this product before it showed up on my vine list \( but i lost it in a tsa search \) philosophy purity is my favorite cleaner and i tend to buy the mega bottles , but i on a whim tried this and was really pleased with it both price wise and its it works well it 's not drying , it removes my eye makeup gently and i only have to use a small amount \( less than the size of a quarter \) so , while this one may have been free , my previous one was n't ! an affordable , effective winner !
5	wonderful texture and fantastic coverage it was extremely happy with the feel on my skin it lasts quite a while to until you take it off excellent product
5	i agree a little goes a very long way , and it smells fantastic ! this is my new favorite face cleanser
4	i am fascinated by how good this makes my trouble spots , lower neck and lower arms that have gotten the most sun exposure , feel softer , less ravaged , less dried out
5	i wanted to reorder another color , but it is no longer available , so tried this beautiful rosy red color almost translucent , so color looks very natural almost like you bit your lips and color came up with a shine very moisturizing but wears off easily i ca n't wear many because they dry too much not this one
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
3	a summer favorite , fuschia with a hint of shimmer i love this color , but this bottle is thin normally i would need two coats to cover , but i need 3 from this bottle
5	hot , hot , hot ! we used tropix as the tip color for our french manicures it worked great hint the color is very close to opi 's cajun shrimp , which we used for our pedicures !
5	the orange scent is amazing and this is really moisturizing it 's very thick so i do n't like using this during the day because it does leave a weird white film on your lips i highly recommend just using this as an overnight lip balm because your lips will feel amazing by morning
5	this color was a lot of fun very neon i used about 3 coats and it is so nice i got a lot of compliments on it
5	this is a light grey goes on opaque with 2 coats tip wear is n't as as with darker colors product needs a uv lamp to cure
3	unfortunately this is yet another strongly scented \( think baby powder \) l'occitane lotion every so often i get one because i hear such good things about them and they lotions themselves are really great but i'm certainly not going to slather them on when the smell is so strong \( and frankly unpleasant \) i suppose there would be an if they decided to change their signature scent which i assume this must be , since it 's been the same for all the products i 've tried thus far i wish they 'd make an unscented version i know shea butter tends to have an earthy scent that many people do n't like , but this lotion is only 25 shea if you do n't mind the smell , definitely give this a try but steer clear if you 're sensitive to strong perfume y scents
4	i use this when i get all up if you have an already shiny or oily complexion i would not recommend as sometimes it does make me look oily
5	i love this vichy vichy neovadiol elixer i'm not a girly girl and do n't really have any set beauty routines and if not for getting this stuff to review i would most likely have never tried it or even heard of it before but i am glad i did n't miss out on this i have very sensitive skin and most things that i put on my face causes me to either break out in acne , or causes my skin to look raw and chapped i really did n't have any expectations that this would be any different , but i am happy to say that it is my skin is more plump and soft and smooth and it really does look younger i'm 52 , and this may be the first real girly beauty routine that i hang on too when my bottle is gone , i will definitely buy it again my skin feels better than ever
3	was a little shocked to open up the package and find this inside seemed super small and quite expensive for what you get and the size i know this is a luxury type of brand so if you 're willing to pay that for a small container of a blush like product than you may like it if you get the right shade the petal color is akin to a flushed type of look , not bad , looks good , works well but not sure if this shade will blend with all skin tones good points it 's easy to apply you can use your fingertips and apply on cheeks as a blush or lips for a flush of color so it 's versatile plus it 's loaded with vitamin e and shea butter to nourish and moisturize the skin it 's paraben free as well if you buy this you can also custom build your jouer palette by attaching compacts side to side and lining up tracks that slide together or simply the pegs back to back and slide together to expand the palette , which i find to be a unique feature my opinion is you 'd get a better value with the whole palette \( which is also expensive \) but contains a lot more of a diverse mix of products and a lot more of the product \( s \) for the money overall , it 's a nice brand but i 'd give this alone three stars and go for the palette with everything included instead
5	ok i have tried so many vitamin c serum 's and i do love them but there is something about this obagi that is making my skin look glowy i ca n't explain it i have really dry , dull skin and was told that c serum 's are an amazing trick to the skin up but this is the first vitamin c serum i have bought where i actually can see the results ! i love this product ! pricey though ! i 'll have to finish the bottle and see if it 's an i ca n't live without when i'm done but so far , it 's looking that way highly recommend
3	ok product after testing , i would rather use the its a 10
5	i 've used many different types of moisturizers this one is really good it 's not at all oily or creamy but leaves my face with a nice , refreshed feeling , and smooths my skin right away it 's odorless and easy to use and it does get skin clean i did n't test with a lot of makeup so i ca n't say how well it removes makeup but it 's really good for basic cleaning and it 's pleasant enough to use every day
5	this crabtree evelyn hand cream is a very high quality product it 's a luxurious and rich hand cream that 's very effective at adding moisture to my dry hands this is a thick cream and only a small amount is needed with each application my hands absorb this cream quickly and immediately feel noticeably softer after each use without feeling greasy or sticky this cream feels similar to l'occitane dry skin hand cream and seems of equal quality to me the crabtree evelyn cream does have a moderately strong scent \( as does l'occitane \) , so for those who do n't like fragrance this may not be the best choice i'm not a huge fragrance fan , but i find the scent interesting and pleasant this cream contains a long list of ingredients , but i mostly smell a fragrant blend of lemon and herbs i do n't find the scent overwhelming , though any stronger and it would be too much for my taste for those with nut allergy , macadamia nut oil is the second ingredient listed the tube and outer packaging are pretty for gifting , and this cream is made in the usa i really enjoy this crabtree evelyn cream it 's an effective luxury hand cream that i'm likely to purchase in the future and highly recommend , except to those people who prefer unscented creams
5	after use for about a week , my husband and i have loved juice beauty blemish clearing mask it feels good on the face , and we both really liked how the mask does n't dry out the face but stays moist it immediately brought quite a bit to the surface and left our pores cleaner we both have noted fewer zits and blemishes since we started using it what more could you ask \? also , my husband has an autoimmune disorder that often as rashes and swelling on the face this seemed to help quite a bit perhaps due to the advertised zinc dioxide it makes sense that this would work to fix blemishes as it decreases inflammation \( which can cause blemishes \) and kills bacteria as it exfoliates and moisturizes we will likely be purchasing more when we run out
5	essie cartel blue is a deep , rich navy blue it 's perfect for any time of the year
5	my grandson is prone to allergy rashes and is very sensitive to many products on the market that have left his skin bumpy and dried out the mustela brand has proven to be one that he does n't react to , leaving his skin so soft the only caveat has been that we find the classic mustela scent to be too strong we had been using the stelatopia fragrance free lotion , but had not been able to find cleanser without fragrance , so switched to another cleanser brand we will definitely be returning to this non scented version it has an ever so slight simple fragrance that 's clean smelling and perfect , leaving a notable soft barrier on the skin the entire family uses this as well
5	my husband discovered this in a spa in hawaii and loves it he is very sensitive to strong smells so the fragrance free product is great can use as all over moisturizer , even on the face not greasy at all this large size seriously lasts like a year
4	this is n't bad , but it 's not great worse still , it manages to go on wet \( and feels wet for a bit \) , does n't do anything about sweat , and has a pronounced smell the latter may well be a positive , as it does n't smell bad , and some may say it smells good it 's also how deodorant works , but somehow here it feels a bit much it does help the 24 hour claims , though like most , i 'd only suggest that time frame in a pinch in the end , it may well be worth a try for you the odor is a matter of preference , and you may be ok with the wet application and lingering moisture for me , i 'll keep looking
5	i love my clarisonic pro , but at 8 5 8 oz including a brush head and measuring roughly 7 1 2 long and 3 1 4 high , it was a bit larger than desirable for travel the clarisonic mia fit , sonic facial cleansing brush system 2 speeds for gentle and invigorating cleansing was exactly what i needed it is about 5 3 4 oz , including a brush head , and measures roughly 2 1 2 x 2 1 2 x 2 1 2 without the brush head it charged the first time in less than twelve hours and the charge lasted through a two week vacation , using the clarisonic twice a day i used the faster speed the entire time and felt it cleansed my skin extremely well while i took the charger with me , i did not need to use it and will probably leave it at home the next time i travel further , my skin stayed much clearer than it has in the past my only regret is that this unit does not come with a carrying container , but that is not a significant negative
1	nope this did absolutely nothing i'm in my mid thirties so i am starting to see wrinkles in my forehead i thought this might them as the product claimed , but not so much i'm not even going to bother posting the before and after pics i took because i ca n't tell which is which
2	am i the only one who finds the idea of a travel shave brush a tad ridiculous \? a normal shave brush takes up , what , like three inches \? this brush has a hollow handle to conceal the brush head in , it all the way down to a size of \( wait for it \) two inches ! wow ! now i have so much more room in my travel bag , i'm going to grab my extra ! if you 're the kind of person who wants to travel with a spare cheap brush they do n't mind losing , well , this thing costs fifty dollars , how much did you spend on your good shaving brush \? now do n't get me wrong , this brush works well it lathers really nicely , though its bristles are just a bit soft imho , but it is a good , very functional brush but fifty dollars \? fifty \? one of the other reviewers said of this product , although this brush is expensive , you are getting what you pay for how \? all it does is apply shaving cream to your face , and do n't tell me its cause its badger hair , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href badger brushes dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 badger brushes a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href do not have dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 do not have a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href to be all dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 to be all a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href that expensive dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 that expensive a sure , the hollow aluminum handle is nicely crafted but its also hollow aluminum they use aluminum to make soda cans , for 's sake ! there 's no way this thing should cost what it does again , a good brush , but the pricing is ridiculous even as a pure luxury item , there is way cooler stuff to spend your money on in short , who is this for \?
4	this adds nice volume to short hair without making it crunchy or greasy , even though the cream does feel a bit waxy i was surprised when i first tried this because it seemed to be completely hard but once you break into the top of the coating , the texture is more like a thick cream i found the scent a bit feminine , considering it 's marketed as a men 's product and like another reviewer , i was n't thrilled that it 's packaged in a glass container anything meant for the bathroom is something i 'd prefer to have in plastic because of the of it ending up falling onto my tile floor or countertop at some point that said , the glass is pretty thick , so it does n't seem prone to shatter easily all in all , a good product if you 're looking to add volume and texture
4	it 's a nice mascara the brush is oddly shaped but surprisingly convenient and fits the shape of lashes well in a direct swipe the mascara itself leaves them not clumped and soft , and pretty well defined i 'd say it 's nice both for everyday use and on a night out the seems to work pretty well , and though i sometimes rub my eyes , it does n't come off for a full tube at 25 , it might be a little pricey , but seems worth it
5	i 've always been a fan of juicy couture i really love this specific scent it is so light and fresh and most of all it lasts all day ! ! ! you really cant go wrong this the bottle itself is simply gorgeous !
5	this is another product i swear by , this has repaired my dry skin without leaving a greasy feeling , this soaks right into skin the scent is so mild and fades out after a few minutes i love that this is made with olive oil a reason this is so hydrating i recommend this to anyone male and female great for daily use
1	so that i could do a good comparison , i used this on only one half of my face after using it twice , one week apart , i did n't see any change in my skin at all , so i decided to step it up and used it again after five days nothing i used it again after four days , then three , and still no results in addition , the detoxifying primer has red 33 and blue 1 , and both the primer and the activator have fragrance which i do n't like and which does linger i find the addition of these ingredients unnecessary and annoying i 've gotten amazing results with the strivectin sd advanced intensive concentrate for wrinkles and stretch marks , 4 5 fl oz , and was hoping that the strivectin glycolic peel would be just as amazing , so i'm very disappointed that it did n't work for me based on my experience , i ca n't recommend this product
4	this is my teenager 's dream eyeliner a rich black formula that goes on smoothly and precisely perfect for the very hip cat eye you even have a few seconds after application to do a little blending before the liner sets and is virtually smudge proof i do have some concerns about using any makeup made in china and did not realize this product there or i probably would not have selected this item to review as part of amazon 's vine program my other criticism is about the cost of this eyeliner i'm not sure it 's worth 10 more than the good quality 10 12 eyeliner that is sold by other cosmetics companies at your neighborhood big box store
4	this is a nice concealer although a little lighter than i expected it is a little dry and works better on oily skin a little goes a long way
5	jack black sun guard sunscreen spf 45 oil free and water resistant is one of the highest recommended sunscreens from our dermatologist for anyone who has experienced skin cancer like some of our family members , finding a good sunscreen is extremely important paying twenty dollars or more for a 4 ounce tube of a great protective suncreen may seem expensive , but it is not in comparison to hundreds of dollars spent to the dermatologist appointments to treat sun damage our dermatologist said the only sunscreens that offer total skin protection from the damaging rays of the sun will contain one of 2 ingredients either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide this jack black contains 8 zinc oxide and will give you total protection you also need both uva and uvb protection , and this sunscreen gives you both , so again you are totally protected finding a sunscreen that gives you the total dermatologist protection is only half of what makes a great sunscreen the other half is that it is not greasy or oily and will not run into your eyes and burn them when you are sweating or swimming outdoors this jack black sun guard sunscreen is not only non greasy and non oily , but it is super light weight , not containing any oils or parabens it 's dermatology tested and has a very light scent , that wo n't overwhelm you or clash with your deodorant or fragrances this 5 star sunscreen gives you total protection , wo n't run or drip into your eyes , goes on super light with a light fragrance it 's everything you would want from a totally protective dermatologist recommended sunscreen
3	bliss 's triple oxygen to the rescue facial in a box is a sample kit of three products first is the foaming face mask a thick , rich , citrus smelling gel that foams when it mixes with water and is applied to the face it is a strange looking reaction , reminiscent of what happens when the scrubbing bubbles hit the shower wall it did seem to get my face clean , and the smell was great second is the little pad thing with the peel solution on it this is sticky feeling , with a neutral scent , that feels really gross on the skin it also takes a long time to dry , and did not seem to do anything to improve my skin the instructions say to use an spf of at least 15 after using last is the little packet of day cream this is a thick cream , with a lovely scent it did a good job of moisturizing my face and neck , but it does not appear to contain an spf , so you will still need to use a sunscreen the cream is a four star , the mask is a four star , and the peel thing is a one star , for a combined rating of 3 stars it is an expensive little kit
4	works as expected goes on smooth stays all day would have given 5 stars if price was a bit lower
4	i like this it improves texture , but not color power of three cream is better
5	this is my husbands favorite deodorant ! he has tried them all and after reading about this one in a sports magazine he gave it a try and has n't looked back
3	a little dark for my complexion \( i am a very fair \) , i actually this when ordering and thought it said eyeliner not eyelighter , so this product is n't something i normally use it did appear to have somewhat good coverage though \( not fantastic just ok \) , but was a mess to try to apply and hard to see how much was coming out of the tube i used it once and was n't worth the hassle for me
5	this is fantastic stuff ! i had not seen this extra large size before , even at my local i normally would not buy here because i can get it with my but the price was right and now our house is set for months ! fyi that the pump did not work but the seller sent out a replacement immediately
5	i love laura geller products i had previously used a different spackle from her but i am really enjoying this oil control primer during times of the month when my face is a little greasier this provides a smooth foundation before putting on my balance and brighten also from laura geller this helps to make more pores look a little smaller and really helps control shine i like the feel of it on my face as well
1	these just really did n't work for me i have diffuse thinning not the worst out there , but quite noticeable sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump , so it was really obvious there was something going on on my scalp if you sweat a little bit or scratch your head , the fibers will really turn into clumps i'm glad this works for other people , but i do n't really want anyone to be able to tell that i'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder
3	it 's a pretty color if you have the time and patience to apply 3 4 coats even after 3 coats you could still see my nail line
3	not sure that this took off my shellac any faster like someone said , or maybe it was in the description , which is what i was really looking forward to , but it certainly did n't dry my nails out like acetone did either so that was definitely a benefit
5	great product !
4	my first highlighter not bad very pigmented ! i know there are better ones out there but this i still a lovely product for the price
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	the question you have to ask yourself is is this lipstick better then other lipstick is it worth the 20 dollars to try to use it so far that answer has been yes first off the color is spot on and looks exactly like what you see it looks nice and it actually does work the way it is supposed to is it perfect , no , but then again nothing is that being said , sometimes things are not worth the little extra you pay , sometimes they are in this case i do believe they are
5	this is the only cleanser that my wife will use mario badescu is a great brand and well worth the price that you pay this works miracles and my wife swears by this brand this is highly reccomend this brand !
5	it really does have a dry finish to it , i was really surprised , i have never a sunscreen like this before and i really like it it 's very nice , not a greasy or slick , pore suffocating cream ! it is light and invisible , absorbs in in seconds leaving a matte dry finish as if you have nothing on your skin i have very sensitive skin and most lotions sting and burn so bad i have to wash them off immediately , i had absolutely no issues with this sunscreen ! \( 5 \) stars easy ! it also has a fresh light scent that dissipates quickly , no strong or heavy perfume smell to it you need to apply it 15 minutes before you go out into the sun and then reapply it every 2 hours , unless of course you go swimming and towel it off , then it must be reapplied right away or if you just go swimming \( no towel drying \) reapply within 20 minutes to maintain full protection at a spf of 45
5	this curler works great and i like the fact that it is infused with organic chamomile my lashes certainly need conditioning with all the mascara i wear and remove daily hope that it helps to keep the lashes in shape , it sounds like a great idea ! i do wear contact lenses and the chamomile does n't bother me at all , it was one of the things that i was wondering about at first , but had no problem the curler also comes with 2 extra refill pads which is nice
5	i use it daily , great stuff i'm outside all day long it 's amazing
5	my brother loves baxter of california these three piece together make for a great value ! pros the face wash lathers well and leaves your face feeling clean and smooth ! the toner is the best item in this trio , according to my brother ! the toner has a light fragrance to it , but the moisturizer and face wash are fragrance free most importantly , this is a great deal all together , this is a pretty awesome gift set there seems to be a noticeable difference in my skin since beginning this baxter of california 1 2 3 skin kit overall , my bother loves this set and when i asked about cons , he had none myself , i do think the containers need a bit of up they 're so simple however , for him , it was a perfect gift set and that is n't heard very often !
5	great
5	everyone loves this color , and my coworker borrowed it yesterday for a special occasion !
3	bought from amazon \( seller \) not horrible but not my favorite these are n't very smooth to apply , which i find odd because it is n't drying on the lips i do not like the tingling feeling as well , it is very mild there is also a slight minty smell , which i am not a fan of since i do n't like mint i do love the fact that you can go for a bright lip for evening if you apply more , or subtle for day if you apply lightly and it does sit well on the lips however the smell , application and feeling on my lips is my i said this is average personally i prefer my ysl lipsticks to this they have a similar effect on the lips , much smoother to apply and they do n't tingle on my lips they are more expensive though
3	at first i thought i received a defective unit the instructions say to turn the dial at the bottom to release a small amount of the product i turned and turned and nothing happened i was ready to give up , but continued playing with it , and after about 50 \( ! \) turns it worked now it works as intended it clicks when you turn the dial , so you can measure how much product will come out aside from packaging , i like the concealer there is a little brush , and the liquid is being squeezed from the middle of it you brush it around your eyes , and then tap with your fingertips to blend at the edges it conceals unevenness nicely , and looks quite well when applied another little annoyance is when you remove the cap to use the product , you cannot put it on the other end it is not the right size to attach there i am not sure why they called the product pixelated do n't worry , there were n't any little tiny squares or dots of different color noticeable as the name suggests
5	so , so smooth i have wanted to try dermablend i'm so glad i checked this line out i have periodic breakouts and i have pretty intense scarring from teenage acne this covers nicely without looking cakey , wearing off , or making me feel like i have on a ton of makeup i love it ! adding this with their cover crme full coverage foundation just looks amazing and adds the perfect coverage to look flawless ! i look 15 years younger !
5	definitely the same quality as the hard water but with a bit less hold what i really like about these pomades is the natural look and feel they leave and the ease that they wash out my first experience with baxters was through amazon vine almost a year ago i 've been buying them since i 'll probably go back to the hard water since my hair is really fine and does n't hold without a lot of help but i could happily recommend the soft water just as easily as the hard water
5	this silky oil has become an part of my winter skin care routine completely eliminating my dry , flaky skin and reducing my fine lines love how it plumps without making my sensitive skin break out three small drops at night plus my normal moisturizer and i wake up with glowing , refreshed skin ! i tried to only use the oil , but found it was n't moisturizing enough at least during the winter the packaging is very luxe with a glass bottle and a push pump cap dropper that easily dispenses one drop at a time so you do n't waste any product as i only need a few small drops a night , this bottle is going to last a long time
5	i 've only used this cream for two days and i am very impressed as it goes on smoothly and penetrates my skin without any feeling of grease it has a nice scent and i did n't have to use a lot as it covers evenly based on what other reviewers have stated , i'm pretty sure that i'm going to see some improvement in my skin within the next few weeks and , i was so impressed with what others have stated with regard to l'occitane that i ordered the hand cream !
5	love this color , received many complaints
5	this is my first encounter with a l'occitane product and i have to say that i am a fan so far the moisturizer is thinner than most i 've been using lately , but it does not leave a greasy footprint like the thicker options the formula feels very loose and liquid y , almost as if it were water based a small dab about the size of half a non marble is enough for a foot and a little goes a long way here the fragrance is probably the biggest love it or hate it point the fragrance is very strong in a insistent sort of way i do n't find it overwhelming , but you wo n't forget that it 's there it does remind me of almonds in a almond milk sort of way however for those calling the scent chemically , i can see that too it does n't smell natural , but it does n't smell wholly artificial to me either performance wise , i am a fan the moisturizer soaks in quickly and works for at least between showers my skin is soft and i do not find myself needing to reapply as the day goes on having said that the scent is n't offensive , i would n't suggest using this as a face cream the smell is probably too much for that proximity to your nose
5	my friend had skin cancer and her doctor recommended trying the obaji skin line after a procedure and noticed great healing results and so naturally i tried it and fell in love the obagi professional c serum 15 is an anti aging serum for most skin types it contains 15 l ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) to help naturally brighten the skin tone the antioxidant packed serum also works to help prevent the signs of premature aging from forming on the skin , as well as treating and correcting the current signs such as fine lines and wrinkles and dark spots i have tried other vit c products in the past and i have to say this one is now my favorite loves it smells great ! no greasy residue your skin feels great immediately after use i noticed a slight difference with my fine lines after a few uses in a 10x mirror , but i have only used it for a week so i cannot report any dramatic results as of yet con i wish it was less expensive if it does begin correcting my fine lines though , it will be well worth the cost the dropper is horrible for the price , each drop is gold wish the design of it was better to prevent waste
5	let me be clear here i do love this product , but it is simply much too expensive for a repeat purchase i use the image line and it works just as well for a quarter of the price i do not have a big problem with wrinkles it 's sagging that is more problematic for me i am going to be 52 and my skin is relatively smooth , but the jowls are beginning to show i also have lots of brown spots i need a very good cream for sagging , but i really do n't think one exists if any one of you ladies knows of one , i sure would appreciate your feedback !
4	i was familiar with the vincent longo brand , but had never used any of his products i received the dew drop radiant blush in the color sandalwood it 's described as a peach color the color is light peach at a glance , but after applying it seems more of a lighter pink shade on me there is a slight sheen , but nothing too sparkly for my complexion it 's a large compact with a mirror i like the subtle color and did n't notice the perfume smell that others have mentioned nice blush , but too expensive for my budget
1	arrived and too to use such a waste of money
5	did n't think it 'd look good on my brown skin but it really made it pop ! very pretty mix of nude , coral , and pink gorgeous wears well too ! very shiny
5	curly head here i use this as a water replacement step in my liquid , cream , oil routine i love it ! i use it on sectioned hair , smooth it in , and follow with pm the conditioner , and a tiny tiny dab of coconut oil on my ends good moisture from this combo neutral scent this is a bit thicker than the pm lite detangler spray , and can spray on a bit sticky if you use too much once my hair dries with it in , the slight stickiness feeling is completely gone and i have soft curls it does n't shrink my hair and leaves my hair very soft , so i will definitely repurchase purchased from ulta 13 for 17 ounce only buy pm from an ulta store or professional salons pm com lists otherwise you risk buying fake , old , or tampered product plus , these stores the price bottle of paul mitchell is actually 9 10 retail in salons
4	well , we had two conflicting results with this product that i will note i think using this product and the ending result depends upon the damage of your hair i like this product i think it smells nice and adds a nice finish to my hair or if i use it to refresh my hair it works well in that area too it adds a bit of and shine as a refresher between washing making it quite convenient for my use my daughter has bleached her hair and uses a flat iron daily , she is in school where they do a lot of experimenting her ends are fried i suggested she try this to tame her ends which are fairly this finishing cream did pretty much nothing to her hair it may have just soaked in her porous hair not leaving anything on the outside i do n't know , she also did n't think it smelled very good so , two very different results i have to say , i really liked the packaging on this product with a classy recycled paper box and the bottle of cream is pretty i like this cream as a finishing touch , or a refresher my daughter , not so much i think it does depend on the shape of your hair as to whether this will work on my daughter 's hair , we applied quite a bit of product with no real result and for me , a little bit will work on my hair if your hair is burnt and , it may not do wonders but if your hair is healthy , this may add some pick me up to your style
3	i do not care for this foundation i suppose i am used to foundations that are more sheer my skin has few flaws , so that may be why i found it too heavy after using my fingertips , i did not like needing to blend it with a brush i found that my skin absorbed the moisture in the foundation and left me with streaks i suppose if i wanted to cover a discoloration or blemish on my face , that i would work with this foundation more but i gave up after one trial also , it turned out to be too dark for my skin tone which is fair
5	i live in an area where the water is hard , but aside from that , water has trace amounts of all kinds of substances that just ca n't be filtered out , and that really do n't do your skin any good since we do n't drink water out of the tap here , why would you want it on your delicate facial skin \? well you have to use it to wash the face , but after cleansing , i spritz this on and let it set awhile before i put on any creams or serums with my irritable rash prone skin , i find this process reduces redness in the morning , i do n't wash my face at all , but just spray this on \( i have not oily skin \) i also like the fact that its not in a plastic container , therefore none of the plastic residues are into the product
5	fantastic product
4	this is a light and subtle highlighter that dispenses product for easy application in a brush form especially in the winter , skin gets dry and after application of foundation and make up it can use a little highlighting to bring back the glow i prefer subtle highlights and this product does not make your face look shiny but gives it a glow that looks really nice in photographs if i want more shimmer i can always use a bronzer i have another product from nars is that is also an illuminator in compact form and this product complements it nicely i can carry this in my purse for quick touchups
1	it feels like petroleum jelly it leaves sticky residue on the skin , and it stays sticky for hours no wonder the main ingredient after water is mineral oil ugh it did n't do much to my very dry flaky patches , although in those places , more of the cream got absorbed , and did n't feel as sticky
4	this face primer is excellent ! i have oily dry combination skin , and this product does n't come off or cause my skin to flake it leaves my skin with a smooth finish and lasts for hours i do have to mention that the shimmer is a bit much but it does n't ruin the consistency of the primer at all i love how a small amount goes a long way definitely a must in anyone 's makeup collection !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	i love dermablend it covers spider veins real well and spots i have a couple of sun spots on my chest , not large ones but it doesnt do well on those without looking fake finding the right shade is really tough i am fair and their light colors are pinky on my skin and the yellow tones are way too yellow i use a high end powder from another line and once i get this in the right place i cover then with powder it does crack if you make it thick it also looks thick if your skin is oily a while after you put it on the great is it does not irritate or break me out i rate it highly because of that this particular tube \( bought two \) was a little dried so i may be hesitant to order here again it does cover very well , as well as anything i have ever found but not sure about scars or i apply a base first and it smooths my pores pretty good too
5	like
4	most reviewers are pretty critical about this hand mask they have good reasons it 's expensive for a single use hand mask that 's right you 're paying 10 for one disposable treatment you can justify it by saying that a similar treatment in a spa might cost 2 5 times more 1 you must tear mask at the 2 wear the gloves 3 secure the straps 4 add the massage oil 5 wear 10 20 minutes or longer for intense treatment 6 throw everything away 7 do n't wash away the residue let it work its way in karuna should price the single use a bit more aggressively to encourage people to try it if they like it , they can get a 4 or 5 pack option just do n't expect miracles on a single use product
5	this stuff works ! i 've had problems with other moisturizers making my eyes water when i apply them around my eyes juice beauty does n't do this but what it does do is a great job at smoothing out fine lines besides applying it around my eyes i also put it on my hands which seem to be aging more quickly than my face \( probably because i usually sun defying products on my face but not my hands \) the result was that it smoothed out my skin texture very quickly and for quite awhile even though i washed my hands several times despite this they remained smoother for at least four hours there 's a very slight smell when you first dispense the product but it fades quickly it also sinks into your skin fast it has a handy pump delivery system with a lid that clicks in place to prevent spills the only slight problem i have with the product is that it 's difficult to dispense a super small amount but there are always other body parts where you can apply the excess i'm also prone to break outs but did n't have that issue with juice beauty to sum up it 's effective , lasts for quite awhile , and a little goes a long way
5	this really makes your hair shiny and healthy looking i lost my hair due to chemo , and when it started coming back , it was dull and sad i used this and it really made it look better five stars
5	perfect spring pink
5	i love all of the borghese line
4	obagi medical gentle rejuvenation soothing cleanser has a gel like consistency it has the faint scent of beauty products from long ago reminds me of the 60 's or 70 's and my facial creams the instructions say to apply to damp face and neck with moistened fingertips and rinse completely the soap easily rinsed with water and left my face feeling clean and very soft there was no soap feeling whatsoever my skin was not tight the claim for this product is to make your skin feel comfortable and soft my skin was already comfortable so soothing was n't needed in my case the cleanser definitely made my skin soft after use the bottle is 6 7 fluid ounces , which is pretty small for the price you can get by with using about a quarter sized portion of cleanser , though a little does go a long way still , the price is steep to me if i had sensitive and irritating skin , i might think it was worth the price though i generally try to exfoliate my skin once a week or so , but otherwise do not use soaps or products on my face i moisturize after showering and after removing makeup with water my skin is in great shape after years of this simple regimen if you need something for sensitive skin and can afford this , you might want to try it it does make your skin soft
5	definitely a good value ! very satisfied with how my hair feels after using !
4	so far i am liking this shampoo ! i have thick , wavy , color treated hair and i definitely notice a difference if i am using shampoos that are not formulated for color treated hair this stuff lathers well and leaves my color shiny and vibrant i personally like the smell of the shampoo , it smells more like the high end salon brands i do not own the conditioner that goes with it but i think that i would like this shampoo even more if i did ! if you do not mind paying a higher price for your hair products i would see no reason not to buy this brand !
4	number 1 , i do not like to spend a lot of time on my hair i got things to do , places to see , and so i needed a curling iron that did what i needed it to do make me look pretty in 4 minutes or less this does it ! ! ! it heats up fast and it is just the right diameter to do what i need curl my bangs i was glad i read the reviews about how hot it gets because , yup , this machine does get hot so i only put it to a medium heat level i love the easy way the bar flips up and down so i can i easily lay it on the counter while i brush my hair the only problem is it does not automatically shut off otherwise i would have given it 5 stars
5	this lotion leaves no sticky residue , has a beautiful , light floral scent that lingers , and seemed to keep working even after i washed a sink full of dishes in addition , i did n't need to use a lot to get a moisturizing effect this compares favorably with the aveeno lotion i have been using recently
5	i thought this would be like every other salicylic acid cleanser , but there is something about it that seems to tighten and close my pores far more than the other products i 've tried the cleanser is largely scentless , light feeling , and leaves no residue on your skin i have very tough skin , lots of huge pores , and have recently started getting menopause related acne this seems to take care of the greasy and reddish spotting i was getting and also dried up any of the cysts that had already made themselves noticeable the directions say you can use it 3 times a day but , as tough as my skin is , i feel like once a day is plenty and more would be too drying i'm excited by this product as nothing else has worked to clear my skin for the long term
5	i really like this i alternate using it with their regular cleanser and then only use it in the evening i like nia24 products in general a little goes along way and it keeps your skins feeling smooth and fresh
3	it looks watered down
5	great product long wear
5	this is the best makeup ever i will never use anything else
4	my wife and daughter have been using obagi products and my wife got to try this one i really like this toner , however im not sure long term what it is supposed to do for the skin after ive used my obagi cleanser , i put a bit of toner on a cotton ball and apply it to my face it appears to do just what it says its gentle and helps balance the skin after cleansing \( i e , adds a bit of moisture after the cleanser has removed all oils from the face \) im just not sure what it does , considering after the toner is used , i use the moisturizer \( or serum , or peptide complex \) i could n't tell a huge difference on days when i skipped the toner though i could tell a difference when i skipped the moisturizer , serum , peptide complex , etc anyway , if you like to use a toner , this is a good one im just not sold considering the price tag
5	this is the most emollient foot cream i 've ever tried i put this all over my body before bed and i wake up with silky skin and it smells great too !
3	it 's ok not sure i 'll get it again smells good , but feels a bit waxy
4	this lotion is a little heavy i use it when my skin is especially dry but not every day i like it because it is not full of glycerin too much glycerin irritates my skin the scent is ok , nothing special
5	good purchase
5	i requested this to try and get my husband to stop using mousse for this thinning hair , and use something modern and manly first off , this has a great scent , \( sweet tobacco \) but it is a strong one if you do not like heavy scents or wear a signature scent , this may get on your man made makes great hair products i use the pomade to slick back my thick hair like the pomade , this does have a bit of a sticky feel when using it but easily rinses off with warm water the product does not get crunchy or weird like lesser products can unlike the pomade , this feels a bit drier , \( well , it is a clay \) and leaves a matte finish which is preferable to many who do not want a wet or look this helps the hair stay in place , for the most part , but some may want to additionally use the man made hairspray for extra hold i would recommend this for those with short thinning or wispy hair if you have longer thick , dense hair , go with the pomade \( shiny finish \) or paste \( satin finish \) this product costs a bit more than drugstore , but it comes in a nice glass jar , is good quality and a little bit goes a long way
5	i really like this powder it seems to have more than one color in the powder that gives it a more natural look i had never heard of this brand but took a chance i would definitely purchase it again it gives a bit of a matte finish which is what i was looking for
5	love this sunblock ! would n't use anything else non greasy , non smelly and effective highly recommend and i love the fact it 's non toxic
5	good
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	this edt opens with a burst of fresh citrus lemon , lime , bergamot , grapefruit hint of mandarin orange with underlying herbal notes of verbena , basil patchouli a slight once the citrus settles down there are some spicy carnation woody notes a hint of sandalwood very light floral \( jasmine \) this is a classic citrus fragrance that women men can wear it is uplifting , just out of the shower , clean fresh there are no cloying notes it smells natural it does n't have the usual men 's citrus cologne notes of lavender cedar i like this kind of fragrance on a hot humid day for a citrus edt , this has very good sillage lasting power with one generous spritz , it goes to arm length lasts about 5 hours on my skin becoming an up close , clean herbal with light citrus it lasts even longer on clothing than on my skin citrus fragrance is inherently short lived on skin but this one is better than most do n't overspray thinking it will last longer just plan to reapply later in the day if it fades too much a well made classic citrus
5	this color is soooooi nice ! i get always compliments every time i have it on my nails i keep buying it , this is my 4 bottle !
3	these are described as lightly scented , but i find them to be very strongly scented perfumey , with a musty note not a pleasant scent the wipe itself is soft and decently sized , but due to the scent i wo n't be using these
5	this is the best vitamin c lotion i have ever used the price seems high , but it is a 30 concentrate , most are 10 to 15 it feels great under a moisturizer it does last quite a while one short pump is enough to cover your face
2	i took this because i am very pale and need sunscreen daily i am not impressed i let this warm up in my bathroom for 8 hours before i tried it \( it was cold coming in from the mail \) i almost could not get it out of the tube , it was so thick it did not apply easily with a make up sponge so i used my fingers my skin looked uniform but uniformly chalky i am not sure who the intended market is for this product but i ended up with an unpleasant orange tone to my skin unless i followed this with a lot of foundation , i could never wear it to work or out i might take it with me on a camping vacation where no one will really see me overall i did not like the thick consistency nor the color tone it would be helpful for customers to get a sense of how deep the color is of this product perhaps a color swatch \? had i known the depth of the color i 'd have never chosen this
5	i really like this product its very nice it has a great smell well priced i use it at night and wake up with soft hands
4	this is a gorgeous champagne highlighter a lot of people say it is very similar to the champagne pop highlighter it probably is somewhat similar but it 's not exactly the same color
4	first , i like that this company does not practice animal testing my wife likes this cleanser and says it leaves her face feeling fresh and clean it has a slight fragrance that , like some others have said , smells a little like a men 's aftershave but it 's pleasant she also likes that it comes with a pump so it 's easy to use and there 's little waste suds up very well a little goes a long way except for the price , what 's not to like \?
5	in one word , sexy i put this on my husband and it smells great it is a little musky , light , masculine but not too overpowering some of my husbands other sprays have an smell and i 've told him he ca n't use them like the aerosol lingers in the air and makes my eyes sting but this is softer and does n't bother me at all the bottle is great with a outer wrap it makes it look great sitting out on a dresser
5	if you are looking for a soft floral or soft fruity sweet fragrance , this is not for you it has a bold sophisticated floral fragrance that in my opinion that is anything but soft i love this fragrance ! it definitely has a scent which makes you feel put together , sexy , and in control i would say it is a women 's fragrance rather than a girls i generally purchase light scented fragrances , but this one is a nice change of pace personally two squirts do the job for me and the scent is not overwhelmingly strong after around 5 minutes i do n't even notice it , but if i check for it , it is still present the scent lasts well on the skin throughout the workday overall , a great quality fragrance !
5	i'm in love with this polish ! its the perfect neon pink for summer and looks super hot with my tan ! people keep commenting on how much they love the color and want to know brand and color this could possibly be my new fav !
2	polish chips very easily love the color
5	good
1	it just did not work , despite the impressive packaging and attention to detail in the design and construction
5	this is a really nice moisturizer sunscreen when i first got it and opened it , my first thought was that it was going to be too dark for my light skin fortunately , it absorbed into my skin and was n't too dark at all the scent is a very light , mild scent that is n't too overpowering which works well for me and my sensitivity to strong scents i have very sensitive skin that breaks out at the slightest most moisturizers and sunscreens will make my face break out terribly so far , this has not caused a breakout in my skin i am very light complected so i need all the protection i can get when out in the sun , and this product gives me that without irritating my skin or making it feel greasy
5	i have been using this products for years
3	love the color ! the polish goes on kind of clumpy for a brand new polish that is the only negative and why i am not giving it a 5 star i'm a little disappointed with that , because i absolutely love this color and thought essie was the brand to get ! !
2	light its top coat i swear no color at all
5	this definitely works ! ! my nails feel much stronger than it was before applying this also this gives your nails a more natural look it is beautiful ! ! i would highly recommend this for everyone guy and gal
4	this worked for me ! a little goes a long way too ! my bangs are thinning , so i use it right in front i would recommend it
5	cnd weekly polish yours opaque cream dark purple almost black color polish beautiful for any change of season can be worn year round thanks
5	have used it for a year , first time form amazon although it appears a little lighter than the doctor 's office , it 's still seems to be pretty much the same product the price is right
5	seller shipped item promptly this sunscreen applies so smoothly and protects well does n't irritate my sensitive skin either !
4	this exfoliating body polish has been a nice treat for my wife and i to try out on our skin i have been using it after shaves and find that my neck area feels better than when i just rely on some store brand aftershave i never really exfoliate though so i 'd imagine i 'd get the same effect from other just normal exfoliators where this product really shines though is the anti aging aspects while my skin is n't in terrible condition it 's comforting to know that it 's being protected from such issues i see it kind of like using whitening toothpaste when you have white teeth you do n't really need it but it lessens the chance you 'd end up getting stains in that case and helps minimize that crepe paper issue in this case it smells kind of nice it 's not too overpowering but expect it to have some leftover smell it it afterwards some products come on with a smell but then disappear but i found i could still detect this a bit later it feels nice on the skin and i have no complaints with any residue issues afterwards in terms of the claim about any skin types i have extremely sensitive skin which often will break out into eczema rashes if any products that are n't made for super sensitive skin are used on it with this product my skin did n't do that it 's hit or miss really with skin products as even some perfume types wo n't necessarily trigger any rashes but i can say at least in my case my sensitive skin was fine make sure you try only a little at first if you want to be safe though and confirm hard to really just test out a product like this due to the price though i 'd say it 's probably too expensive for most users the reason why i'm inclined to give it 4 stars is that it 's intent it to erase crepe skin if it was just an exfoliating body wash i 'd probably see it as just way too expensive it still feels a bit pricey but you pay for the results you 're looking for i 'd
5	the obagi hydrate luxe face cream is a very luxurious rich feeling moisturizing cream it almost feels more like a butter than a cream and spreads well and absorbs quickly it is a soft cream color and has no noticeable odor even through the harsh drying winter \( we use a wood burning all winter so my skin gets very dry \) this face cream is doing wonders and i feel like my skin is glowing i would recommend for anyone suffering with dry skin on their faces to try this cream
2	whats the \? i sadly got two pimples a while after this came in i had used it on another pimple and did n't see anything so great about it , but thought what the heck lets be all so my loss was your gain after 5 days of using both this and a generic brand 5 there was not noticeable difference my gf thought this product might have moisturized more but the results sure did n't show it also worth noting neutrogena makes a formula which 25 if you really need acne taken care of maybe this has some ingredients that make it more effective or more worthwhile but not for my skin also just because they are in dermatologists office doesnt much confidence the product for me i went to dermatologist in beverly hills because my insurance covered it the guy had no idea what was causing a rash on my face or why it would he through everything and the kitchen sink at it and said we do n't really know why this happens but lets see if it works also he tried 3 different products on my dark circles under my eyes and none of them worked i was not bothered at all by them but he because guess what he has his own very successful beauty line i was clearly not his usual once he left the room and his pa said i could get literally the same products minus an ingredient or two that had no appreciable clinical effect mostly otc i'm sure there are ancient or ingredients that would make a difference in some products it just seems these doctors have no to actually research it they just find a sales angle and go with it
3	i was in hopes of liking this lotion moisturizer more unfortunately , its more like applying suntan lotion and does not absorb well its unscented , which is fine , but honestly , i would prefer a little smell i use it after using the toner if you do n't let the toner try first , then its a mess but even after the toner dries , it doesnt absorb well no matter how long you rub i just wait a bit before i leave my so you cant see all of the white streaks on my face
3	this is only lightly moisturizing and the scent reminds me of an shop old and musty but not totally in a bad way the fragrance is from my grandmother 's time in the early 's the moisturizer sinks in almost immediately and leaves smooth lightly softened skin behind if the scent was n't so , i 'd like this as a summer lotion because it is non greasy and has no stickiness to it
3	this badger shave tonic is lightly astringent because the second ingredient is alcohol the effect on the skin is pleasant , but if you have dry skin , you may want an aftershave or tonic that has more oil or other or in it as other reviewers have mentioned , the scent it overwhelmed in a bad way by the menthol , which is a harsh effect rather than being merely pleasantly minty it 's mildly off putting , but dissapates quickly the label says that there is rosemary , eucalyptus , camphor and as well , but i do n't pick up any floral or warm spicy notes at all the fragrance needs to be better balanced
5	great top coat , exactly what i wanted
5	i quite like this brush , despite it 's extravagant price if you ca n't afford this , method makes a much cheaper version that is quite nice i bought the small version of the popular mixture from them \( mm \) \( i also bought the straight bristle brushes from mm but they were too soft i guess my hair is too thick or there 's too much of it for a pure boar bristle brush \) i'm glad when i bought this mason pearson one i got the popular mixture it feels fantastic on my scalp i actually enjoy using it , and now all my other brushes are
5	this is the first time i have used this product works great and does not have any unpleasant fragrance
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
5	this works really well to cover areas needed i love it and use it often highly recommended you should try it
5	this just feels wonderful i have n't been using retinol on my face just because of general not paying attention i have been using a vitamin c serum booster i know that is supposed to be before moisturizer but just have n't been bothering i know better than that i am 54 years old and know that my skin feels great because i have been using good cleansers and moisturizers consistently for almost 40 years now was not a time to get my skin just soaks this up after just a few uses the skin around my eyes feels as soft as ever
4	i rarely wear perfume or cologne because i do n't like overpowering scents to me , an ideal cologne should smell almost like the body lotion i wear after showering subtle , pleasant , and non cloying eau de rochas promised that experience and so i decided to try it first , im impressed with the bottle that its quite affordable price the multi vintage glass look prepared me for quality contents i used it on my wrists and for me the top note was citrusy with a tart lemony and musky smell upon first application with a hint of bergamot it settles in with a crisp and refreshing scent while its being marketed as unisex , i think thats a bit of a stretch i like it do n't love it but cologne is very subjective and each person will make that for herself
1	very disappointed it may be 7 free but it 's rated a 6 on ewg ugh ! i was going to go back to essie \( rated a 5 with ewg skin deep \) but will try zoya \( 5 free \) because of all the good things i read about it it was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed
5	a little bit of this on my wife 's cheekbones created the illusion of more brightness i think it looks good lightly applied for a hint of shimmer this counters the appearance of dark circles around the eyes the key to applying this powder highlighter has got to be moderation , for most people \( a small percentage somehow can do something good with what would be excess for most \) just enough to combat a hint of fatigue seem right to me
3	i have thin fine hair and i keep it highlighted to help with thickness and volume i was excited to try this with the promise of plumping up my hair and giving it body and volume here comes in a small metal can with a spray pump and easily sprays a fine mist the results well , it 's not quite the miracle i was expecting but it gets kudos for not irritating my very sensitive scalp most of the time when i try something new i spray it on and then within 10 minutes start itching but it did not happen with this spray i 've done this both with wet and dry hair it 's heat activated so i spray the roots of the crown of my head , flip my head upside down and dry with a blow dryer and then finish right side up using a metal round brush i think maybe i noticed a slight difference maybe i'm not going to say that i'm positive because there was n't enough difference for me to not turn around and use my normal product when i follow it up with a inexpensive leading company 's dry shampoo then i achieve the results that i wanted the volume and thicker hair i would say phyto in conjunction with it is a good combination it may just not get the results for me but you may get the results for yourself because a lot of people love this product i do like volumizing shampoo but i do n't know that i would order this product again
5	i never liked browns , but i love this color ! it 's called take it outside ! great for fall , winter and spring formula is nice , goes on smooth , shiny , and lasts a long time ! the darker color on other fingers is chinchilly by essie which is nice too
2	im use to essie polishes being of better quality i had to put on 3 coats to get an accurate color pay off
5	covers up those shiny spots
1	this product is not great it has a very watery consistency , it does n't absorb , it 's sticky it tastes good , but you 'll find yourself quickly removing it by doing daily life tasks that said , it makes an okay cheek tint i had a terrible time blending it , and it was tacky in texture all day , but the color is nice \?
5	i use this face scrub daily , in the shower , prior to shaving it is the best face scrub i 've ever used
5	i have a pretty rough time shaving , as i have rather thick beard growth and sensitive skin while the green label proraso was quite impressive , this red sandalwood formula really does the trick ! its meant for heavier beards and take it from me it is without a doubt the thickest , richest lather i 've ever experienced it really does soften the skin and provide a more comfortable shave my wife also likes the sandalwood fragrance too , so that 's a plus as well ! it might seem a tad pricey compared to a normal can of cream , but there 's no comparison with the quality and the tube will last you months as you only need a pea size amount of the cream to lather up if you 've had a tough time shaving your thick beard , give this stuff a shot , its nice !
3	it does a great job of taming any beards or mustaches , my husband 's bear gets all wiry and messy looking naturally , but this keeps him looking clean my only complaint is that the scent is way too strong , it 's like he 's wearing a strong cologne if they lightened that scent even a little bit i would like this a lot more
1	really disappointed two raved about oribe , as if it was the best brand ever i'm unimpressed first of all , i bought it quickly , thinking i bought shampoo it was bad enough as shampoo i e , i was disappointed that it did n't leave my hair soft and it really did n't brighten it and , since i have super curly hair , i frequently use conditioner to wash my hair when i realized this was conditioner , i was more than disappointed talk about drying out my hair ! what a waste of money the smell is ok , a bit too perfumey for me i specifically purchased it for use with keratin treated hair while this claims to be safe for keratin , the second time i used it i noticed that my hair was starting to get frizzy i found this to be really as i'm only 6 weeks into a keratin treatment , and it 's winter , and keratin usually lasts me easily 3 months through a steamy summer i ca n't say for sure that this was the cause , as each keratin treatment and product is different , and i 've had 3 different keratin products over the past 9 months frankly , even if this worked really well , the price is outrageously absurd and i 've had better luck with drugstore purple shampoos and conditioners no more oribe for me
3	vichy quenching mineral mask the cold and windy weather make my skin very dry , stiff and even flakes no matter how many times a day i apply moisturizer i applied the mask after the toner since you are not supposed to rinse this off it could have been that i had just exfoliated my face but there was a very slight tingling sensation \( less than ten seconds \) it took longer than five minutes to absorb , i would say more on the 15 minute mark i did not immediately feel any difference but i did notice my face was very sticky , the kind of sticky you get from a wet piece of candy i touched my face and my fingers were sticky from touching ! it was not until about half an hour later that i finally felt any sort of effect on my face while the scent is not bad at first , it might feel irritating to your nose after some time , depending on your nose sensitivity i might have to stick to once a week application as i was not a fan of the stickiness the following day my skin was as dry as the day before , but i know i cannot expect a one time use to do miracles overnight maybe i did something wrong and if you are a beauty expert , i am more than open to suggestions on how to avoid that in the meantime , i am giving it 3 stars until i find a solution to the sticky issue
5	the perfect companion to the day time oil free moisturizer ! what i love best is no perfume scent in the products , which can irritate people , particularly if you happen to wear contacts , as i do i can honestly say that after 3 weeks of use , my skin is brighter , has an even tone , and some redness has been diminished fine lines in the forehead are far less noticable , which is most welcome while the product is marketed to guys , i am sure that either sex could easily benefit from this superior formula ! what a terrific gift this might make and the ample size makes it even nicer easily , one of my favorite products !
5	this shaving cream is much better than all the crappy store junk you can name even department store shaving creams do n't hold a candle to this bad boy i bowl lather with conk badger brush and get the most cool fresh warm lather good enough for 2 3 passes i use a dime sized amount and expect the cream to last a while leaves skin smooth and fresh and not dried out , i can skip aftershave balm if i want with this since my skin feels healthy and moist price is decent for what you get so what 's not to love try it if you have n't
3	this would be a nice product if it were fragrance free i am sensitive and the smell of this bothers me so i cannot use it on my face or even on my hands it does have a smooth feel so i use it on my feet and calves , just nowhere near my nose it does not my skin , fortunately
2	it is not useful and i wo n't buy it again
5	lovely color ! !
4	first , in regarding the appearance of authenticity of this product the bottle is very attractive there is a clear plastic snap on heart ring around the stopper \( i removed it because it looks very teen ish \) it is very attractive for a desk or vanity it is a spray there is a cut out type design on the face of the bottle and it looks nice on the vanity fragrance is by nature subjective , and this one is a fresh scent that sparkles and is perfect for day it does n't seem to last a terribly long time , so be aware of that !
5	i have been using this twice daily for 4 weeks light , non greasy and absorbs well i do think my under eye area is smoother but no cream is a miracle i am 52 and am starting to get crows feet this has softened them
5	love this with the eye collagen serum
5	the color is vivid and highly pigmented i love that this cherry shade is not orangy red , but more rose pink it is a moisturizing lipstick usually that means the oil that keeps your lips from drying also let the color fade and wear out much quicker not the case here , the color goes on creamy smooth and precise like matte lipstick it does n't smear primer is recommended but i wore it without and had dinner right after at end of the night , the color is there and needed only a bit of touch up i'm not familiar with the make brand , but this lipstick will stay in my go to tray
5	on time , i love it
5	the menthol feels great on this , but more importantly , it contains the most popular active ingredient that is proven to work against acne , salicylic acid it does a good job of clearing up my skin and it does n't dry me out a little goes a long way
5	i love essie nail polish it 's the best out their and the prices here are fantastic ! very happy with this purchase !
4	bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do i had to use a high gloss top coat i also had to layer up to get the desired coverage i wanted i would describe the color as barbie pink and i love it
5	this smells amazing it is the perfect blend of spices without smelling overwhelming i love this fragrance
4	has a slightly old lady smell to it other than that , it does a good job
3	this shampoo is a thick and rich looking green it does n't smell at all like eucalyptus , which was what i was expecting from the description , but the scent is pleasant and not too strong the shampoo works fine it leaves my hair soft and clean but there is nothing really out of the ordinary about it
5	i thought this comb was expensive but i bought it because i am a fan of the baxter of california products and have never been disappointed after several uses i realized the price is a i previously used a brush and decided to switch to a comb as easier to throw in my travel bag grabs all of my hair which is very thick and i comb it back than forward in two easy motions for a style than i use the other half of the comb to my goatee
5	on the whole , being born blonde is a fabulous blessing my only teensy , tiny , wee complaint is that i have super light eyebrows that literally disappear when i have my picture taken with a flash it 's creepy , actually they 're super pale i am talking pale i have used sephora 's eyebrow kit \( which comes with and two blendable shades \) which i love , but this pencil is easier to use and more portable bonus strawberry blondes will be able to use this pencil as it has a very slight reddish tint
4	this helped a bit with breakouts but not as much as i was hoping it did make my skin feel super smooth worth trying for the price though ! it 's a little hard to use some people use a cotton ball but what i found most effective was wetting my beauty blender , dipping it into the powder , then dabbing onto my face worked like a charm !
5	i could n't believe i found this for such a good price i was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer my hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him it 's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price i will be ordering more soon
2	i like facial oils and normally i make my own as i can control ingredients and eliminate synthetic fragrances i am trying to my routine and decided to try otc facial oils this one has a nice texture and did n't make me break out , which i appreciate after using it the first the skin around my eyes and my eyelids burned like crazy i went to the box and saw it says do n't use around eyes , and it most definitely means it i am not interested in an oil that is so harsh i use around as that is where i most need the oil side note , that one time use helped under eye circles ! too bad i cant use it for that , and i wish i knew which ingredient was responsible for the improvement the was way to strong and harsh lastly , the oils ruined my nail polish normal opi polish with seche vite top coat
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
5	while often people think of julep as a nail polish brand they 've also been into makeup and skincare in the last couple of years i 've found the products to be hit or miss , but have generally really liked their lip products those positive continued with these matte liquid lipsticks to start off with , the formula is excellent it applies easily with the wand attached to the cap it 's very opaque , but creamier and more hydrating than other liquid lipsticks i 've tried and it 's long lasting so it 's a great choice when you may not be able to reapply but still want it to last after eating and drinking i also like these do not bleed or transfer so my lip line stays precise and distinct it also does n't over accentuate lip wrinkles ! i also surprised myself with this color i tend towards mauves , nudes , peaches , and purples i 've always found red tricky to pull off but i find this deep cool red to be flattering to my blonde hair and neutral tones light medium skin overall i'm really liking this i'm not yet convinced that julep can do any product flawlessly , but their lip products definitely win me over
5	my wife and i enjoy this product and we see the improvement on our mature skin because this cream works well on mature facial skin the benefits are many it locks in the brightening benefits of one it 's ingredients , the white marble , that provides skin with a deep and lasting hydration , brightens , lightens the skin , evens out overall skin tones , and creates a protective , hydrating barrier that feels soothing the dark spots and patches on our skin seemed to vanish after a short daily application for best results the use of this white translucence cream is recommended to use mornings and evenings , and this is what we did even after a few days of applying this cream , we saw the benefits of a younger , smoother skin
4	both lotions smell very nice , not over powering and wo n't compete with your perfume if you wear one i chose this because my skin is super sensitive and i figured if it 's safe for a pregnant woman , it 's safe for any woman , right \? plus , if it will plump up your breasts , why not your face \? if it 'll remove stretch marks , why not crows feet \? for the bust cream i ca n't say that i 've noticed the differences advertised \( no plumping \) and in checking the ingredients , this scores pretty low on the toxicity scale , which is nice it 's not greasy , feels great when you put it on and i do believe that moisturizer is going to help you feel better and helps keep your skin young looking bust firming serum aqua water eau , peg 6 , butylene glycol , dextrin , 1 , 2 hexanediol , phenyl trimethicone , acrylates c10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer , peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil , glyceryl caprylate , hydrolyzed soy protein , dimethicone phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer , parfum \( fragrance \) , xanthan gum , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil , sodium hydroxide , glucose , sophora japonica fruit extract , centella asiatica extract , sorbitol , hydrolyzed avocado protein , maltodextrin , pentylene glycol , citric acid , lupinus albus seed extract , ci 47005 \( yellow 10 \) , ci \( red 40 \) , tocopherol this again is a nice smelling , non greasy moisturizer will it prevent stretch marks \? well , stretch marks are genetic so i would be interested in learning about a lotion , potion or cream that could actually do that ! but again , using moisture on skin that is stretching quickly will make it feel better and certainly can help with the awful itchiness that can start when the belly really starts to pop out there so i would be cautious in believing this will fend off stretch marks science just does n't support that but it 's a nice lotion stretch marks prevention cream aqua water eau , di c12 13 alkyl malate , ethylhexyl cocoate , cetearyl alcohol , dicaprylyl carbonate , hydrolyzed soy protein , butylene glycol , cera alba beeswax cire dabeille , laureth 23 , galactoarabinan , butyrospermum parkii \( shea \) butter , glyceryl stearate , 1 , 2 hexanediol , cetyl alcohol , cetearyl glucoside , glyceryl caprylate , parfum \( fragrance \) , xanthan gum , cetyl palmitate , cocoglycerides , sclerotium gum , zinc gluconate , pentylene glycol , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil , sophora japonica fruit extract , hydrolyzed avocado protein , maltodextrin , citric acid , lupinus albus seed extract , tocopherol
5	i have very dry skin and i'm always trying creams to keep it hydrated so when i saw the chance of trying the juice beauty nutrient moisturizer , i took it but first , i had to go to the manufacturer 's website to see the list of all the ingredients , it would be great if they 'd listed them on the product description as well among its many ingredients are organic shea butter , jojoba , aloe and algae this is my experience with it , it 's a nice moisturizer that is great for my face , and also for my hands after i applied it to my face and neck , i got the idea of massaging into my cuticles , fingernails and hands , and it hydrates them all very well the cream is thick but it penetrates fast and it has a mild and pleasant aroma it 's all natural , without chemicals , or artificial fragrance or dyes and it does n't have any soy components , either i recommend this products both for women and men
5	this stuff really works , i love to use it a day before i go in for a pedicure and it really makes the pedi even better wash your hands after you apply this stuff would not want any of this to get in your eyes by accident
5	yay ! ! ! love , love , love this color ! i have been dying for a lilac color since spring , and just had n't gotten around to purchasing cnd 's rock royalty and studio white , which one website said was the only way to get a lilac color , and then vexed violette came out ! it 's a little darker than anticipated , which is actually perfect for fall , and i think i can lighten it up for spring with a top coat of and roses fun !
5	really nice for those cold dry fall winter months smells gives off a little of that menthol camphor smell , but it evaporates fast and leaves no residual grease or scent
3	i 've tried many , many skin serums , and facial products of this type , and i have found the juice beauty stem cellular repair booster serum , is not really much different than the other high end products i 've tried i have n't really noticed a difference in my facial skin at all , or my neck i 'd really like to find something that would rejuvenate my skin because , although i'm only 50 , i feel like my skin has aged more than it should at this point thus i try the really good products , hoping for a miracle ! i realize none of these products have promised miracles , but i have n't noticed any noticeable repair either ! i would say the texture of this product is rather sticky and tacky once rubbed into your skin it 's a gel serum , and not a cream or lotion , so i suppose it 's to be expected , but it made my face feel pulled like i needed lotion on top the product package does say it 's been clinically for age delay , and blemish clearing so to be fair , perhaps this is for a bit young appearing skin and , i do n't have any blemishes , so i ca n't speak to that i do like that it 's anti oxidant rich , and made without , any artificial dyes or scents , parabens , etc it does have some artificial ingredients , but nothing harmful they are things like which five products like juice serum slip what that does is helps make this a great primer under any make up you might use i just use a bit of concealer around my eye area , and this was perfect under the concealer as long as i did n't wait too long to put on the concealer i would n't use this product on a regular basis considering the price however i would buy it for our daughter 's as a gift , if they used it on their much younger skin !
3	i used this product every day for 2 weeks i was so by its that i had the follow up product aqualia thermal power serum in my amazon cart i removed it for the following reasons this vichy aqualia thermal hydrating refreshing water made it difficult to apply my favorite tinted moisturizer it was blotchy and not blendable it did not slide across my face which is why i like that tinted spf moisturizer so much but i persisted over time , flakes and redness around my mouth started to appear it could be a reaction to the active ingredients , which are water , glycerin , and castor oil or any number of color dyes or the version of polyethylene glycol which is derived from bees wax \( i also have reactions to most bee products from a guy whose name begins with b \) or the copper sulfate , which in large enough quantity dissolves roots from or the agent disodium edta , which is probably used as a preservative or the parfum , which could be anything or the , which is an ammonium salt so i cannot say what my skin reacted to , but react it did i had to discontinue the product and get a prescription from my dermatologist for the redness which also tightened my skin painfully yes , it sounds like plain old water and it was indeed tested on asian \( \) sensitive skin but not on mine anymore \( i am neither asian nor asian \) but i have admittedly wonky skin if you have wonky skin , i would not recommend this if you have normal , normal dry , or otherwise non sensitive skin , then i would say yes , give this product a try but know that you are getting a lot more than just water
5	really shows improvement after a couple weeks my lips are fuller
2	not for sensitive skin irritates me , but smells very good and gives a good tone to the skin
3	this shimmer cooling spray was , i 'll say it in one word random it sprayed on very lightly , and i guess was \( it felt cooler on my skin after spraying this on , than before \) , and it left a very light shimmer on my skin \( the shimmer did not show up that well , but my skin is very light colored \) overall , this shimmer cooling spray just did n't seem to do much it smelled nice , it gave a very light , but at 30 a bottle , not sure what exactly you 're paying for here \? did n't seem to do much for my skin ,
5	i have light skin , large pores , and a shiny face i look so amazingly matte , small and perfect when i use this ! i really like it it is so lightweight on the face , non pore clogging , the powder is really light colored and i thought i might have a bright white face , but it just sort of mattes the face without adding a lot of weight or color i love it i look fabulous i have used the sponge enclosed and a brush both provide a great result i am switching from benefit cosmetics to this velvet touch finishing powder i love the result
5	as usual essie has another hit ! great color for a mani pedi for summer looks great on most skin tones shipped quickly too
5	baxter has made a really awesome bar of soap the scent is potent and masculine and lasts for hours after showering the soap bar has a silky feel even before being after using , i found the soap gave me a very clean feeling while also leaving my skin feeling smooth and soft i almost felt like i had applied a light lotion that said , i will not be leaving the soap bar in the shower to get constantly wet while other family members shower because i do not think it would hold up well staying wet
4	i was honestly surprised by how much i loved this sun screen the bottle has a tip that 's designed to squirt out just the right amount for your face additional the sun screen itself is more liquid than any of the others i 've tried in the past with such a high spf it goes on my face easily and dries in seconds , so quickly in fact that the remainder i just wipe around my hands and there 's no need to even rinse after my skin absolutely loved it and as soon as it dried i felt like i was wearing nothing at all the only complaint is the price point a 1 7 oz bottle is tiny but costs quite a lot
3	do n't like the fact that i had to put 3 coats i wish gel polish was darker like one coat nail polish
5	mat control is a moisturizing product that keeps your skin hydrated for up to eight hours it really works well , goes on just like an ordinary lotion , but works so much better it conceals by closing up your pores look younger while moisturizing ! recommended to reapply 2 3 times each day for best results works great for any season ! summary \( 1 \) paraben free \( 2 \) hypoallergenic \( 3 \) scented formula \( 4 \) non comedogenic brand story bioderma has acquired unique by placing at the service of dermatology
3	i had no idea what to expect from this product i have used it once a week , as suggested , for 4 weeks and ca n't say i have seen any remarkable difference it might make my hair feel a bit smoother , as i do not have straight hair , rather fine wavy hair that is naturally gray , but cheaper moisturizing products that i apply to damp hair do the same job i colored my hair and used this , but again , i did n't notice more shine , or enough to justify the cost i would consider it a good conditioner , but would not purchase again unfortunately
5	beautiful color ! !
5	love the colors !
2	wife review i wanted to give this 5 stars because it 's obagi but i just ca n't this product did n't do anything to brighten or make the skin under my eye more refresh healthy looking these beauty products are not expected to be fountain of youth and given that i have dark circles , i did n't have any high expectations however , i was hoping this product would atleast make minimal impact on the appearance but no effect at all after 2 weeks of use
3	this is the only mustela product we have n't really liked it is extremely gentle and has an unscented smell it does not foam later at all it does not have a soapy feel it feels more like you are washing with hand lotion it just did n't feel right to my wife and me but overall , it seems to clean and not irritate skin so if your child is very sensitive , especially to the foaming agents , this might be for you
5	the perfect every day color goes with everything i use this as my in between color when my nails are short but i want color and strength
5	i just used this polish for my manicure everyone loved it at the salon i am getting so many compliments ! this shade just might work all year long there is a beautiful shimmer to it as well a perfect mauve brown shade !
3	excellent oil absorption , however flakey
4	this color goes on smooth with okay coverage i 'd put a lighter base coat under it to make the color pop it 's a very pretty spring color
5	my husband and daughter love this product because it moisturizes , shapes a little and it does n't weight down hair feels really nice too after you hair dries
5	it does n't matter what type of pomade that you usually use even if you usually do n't use pomade , you will find a formula that you can use with this kit i believe in trying out lots of products until you find the ones that are the best for you the mixer kit allows you to do that since you can use a small amount every time you should have enough for several trial mixes even though the price is high , i did n't think that the kit was a waste of money because you waste money every time you try a new brand that you do n't like you have wasted money the four types of pomades work differently the hard cream variety has the strongest hold , i do n't need a lot of hold most of the time , but it 's good to have my favorite is the cream , but i also use the hard water because it gives a bit of shine the cream has light hold , i use it for a little bit of frizz control and smoother look i personally do n't like the clay the scent is strong and it reminds me of thyme the others have nice and subtle scents i do n't even smell them when when i wear them i would recommend this kit to people who are not sure what product to buy
1	this is not an effective glycolic acid treatment i was suspicious when i saw the ingredients the primer has baking soda as a main ingredient so you 're layering an acid over a base what 's the point \? i tried this on my face and , to do a better comparison , tried it a few times on one hand sure , skin felt softer immediately after treatment there are moisturizers in the mix , so it 's got the short term softening effect of any skin mask but that faded within hours , and over a couple of weeks i could see no difference between the treated or untreated hand this product does n't work you can find effective glycolic acid treatments for far less
5	i love these candles ! they burn wonderfully and smell delicious
5	i love this scent but i'm not a fan of this being a lotion in a tiny bottle it 's 50 on here i used it on the majority of my body \( i'm only \) and it was n't overwhelming or strong , a few hours i can still smell it but i disagree with other people saying a little goes a long way my husband said he could hardly smell it the bottle is very nice looking , but i 'd go with the perfume , not the lotion
5	amazing product that smells wonderful highly recommend
3	not as effective as the topcoat
5	love it
5	love this color was looking for a great rich brown to go with my designs this is amazing a deep undertone of an one blood red makes this more than your average brown completely opaque in 2 thin coats , dries quickly and levels nicely look amazing with a scattered hlgraphic topcoat all on its own and a great base for nail art
4	i'm fair cool and normally when i select a new foundation to try i pick the shade next to the lightest of all shades , and it 's almost always a good match not with this shade , cream 10n it 's like i 've transformed into a vampire unless i put a light dusting of bronzer over it otherwise it 's a good foundation it 's a neutral tone and not too yellow , not too pink i use a slightly damp make up brush but i put it on so sparingly i'm not sure if i'm getting the full effects of the spf 25 i'm sensitive to scent and there is none it covers my freckles across my cheeks nose and a couple darker age spots with ease i recommend going a shade darker than you normally do maybe even 2 shades i have slightly dry skin in the summer , and while this is n't moisturizing , it 's not too drying either i do n't use the dermablend setting powder and this stays on long enough for me from 7 am until i get home from work , around 5 pm
5	this is an awesome color ! i love the name too ! use this one with the silver additive it is beautiful
5	calvin klein has always been one of my few favorite brands for fragrance i particularly like eternity that came out many years ago the floral scent is classic and long lasting now came eternity now and it does n't disappoint eternity now has a light fruity and addictive floral scent i initially found it a tad strong on the first spritz a somewhat sweet fruity note which opens up to a floral bouquet , and finally ends with a cashmere and musk the scent is surprisingly long lasting i could still smell a hint of the perfume at the end of the day the perfume comes in a hefty glass bottle with a , silver and transparent acrylic top just one spray is enough to last the whole day a little really goes a long way
5	very nice product !
5	i am very happy with jane iredale products i use this to my face powder the mist spray melts everything together and reduces the look of makeup it looks natural
4	this is a lovely scent , not very floral but more musky when first applied , it 's more floral but the residual scent after wearing it for several hours is the vanilla musk scent , which i prefer it comes in a cool , roman column like bottle i also like that it seems to be quite concentrated , which means you need just a little so the bottle should last a very long time
5	this is a great translucent setting powder i did not have to re apply it during my evening out so it really set my makeup and prevented any shine
4	product is good , goes on well coverage is light it 's important to get a color that matches your skin tone note that mocha does not match an indian skin tone four stars
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	was excited to try this out after reading the rave reviews on birchbox and beauty blogs this product did n't disappoint ! the sheer formula absorbs well leaving my dull skin dewy not sparkly ! the lightweight coverage with spf is perfect for summer weekends and those with generally nice skin who just need a little boost the tint does minimize the appearance of my fine lines , though i found a little concealer necessary to cover my under eye circles after late nights
5	i was trying all types of products to thicken my thinning hair nothing worked minoxidil only helps in slowing down the process but does nothing for covering the thinning spots this product really works it really does work in covering areas that are thinning , and your friends will not be able to tell the difference it will last all day , the only draw back , it will wash off if your hair gets too wet it is also best to use hair spray to keep it in place
5	this is a great product for redness from rosacea , it hides the red and the spf is good for the occasional sun here in pa ! not a lot of smell and the coverage makes the skin look more even
5	this is the best sunblock i have ever used and as a person who lacks pigment that is quite a statement from me ! it does not burn your eyes , so terrific i have used it on our
2	i could easily overlook the pine ish top note of this at first application , because it wears off in about 15 minutes but what replaces it is a vaguely grassy chemical scent with no depth or subtlety and it only lasts a couple hours , so by the end of the day it disappears without a trace kind of reminds me of the old joke one old lady says to another , the food at this place is disgusting ! and the other , yes , and such small portions ! , since this is allegedly a man 's scent i had my husband try this out a couple times for my though it turns out i did n't enjoy it , and neither did he and i \( a woman \) tried it myself a couple times , since i find many grassy , woodsy scents work for me no dice unfortunately , this is a miss for varvatos
5	love opi !
3	i did not see any difference in my skin by using this product when i my feedback the seller contacted me to say that it usually takes more than one tube i was not comfortable ordering another tube of this product the product suggests you see results almost immediately i love fruit based products wished it had lived up to its name
1	to be fair , the only make up i use is mascara and lipstick that said , my lipstick did not set and was easily came off on my husband 's lips and my mascara ran also , for a few minutes after i sprayed the solution on my face , it made my face sticky that cleared up totally after a half hour or so my guess is that this would better serve people who use foundation but i do n't know for sure
5	very happy with purchase !
2	most people who are used to getting their shaving cream from an aerosol can would not call this a shaving cream it is closer to an old fashioned shaving soap that requires you to work up a lather with a shaving brush not a shaving brush , i found that it required quite a bit of the product \( about 2 inches out of the tube \) to cover my face , so i would not expect the tube to last a very long time although it looked reminiscent of shaving from a bar of soap , on those times when i someplace without shaving cream , the oils in cade allowed for a smooth , close shave while the scent is not unpleasant , i do not like scented shave creams , and i would not buy this product again
5	great colors , applies well , looks awesome i would recommend
3	pretty color but it is really silver not gray , lighter than appears in the picture , its okay but i really needed wanted a color that was gray and a little darker
5	i really like this blush , it is a very light color and it has a nice shimmer to it the case is nice , and it has a mirror easy to apply with powder brush good quality ,
5	the is clinical products were introduced to me by my skin care specialist do your skin a favor and get this is it expensive \? yes but worth every drop think how much you will save in getting all those drugstore serums that do n't work will it totally erase wrinkles \? no , of course not but it will definitely make your skin brighter healthier looking and it certainly does lessen the look of wrinkles
5	the spf 40 this is a good level for my sensitive skin it is 20 zinc , so it does n't soak in right away but the medium tint kept it from looking like a kabuki mask i tried rubbing it in parts of my body with different tones and it blended in just fine on both the tan areas and the lighter still people with darker skin may find it too light it was like a mass market medium foundation color i do n't notice any scent and it does not bother my sensitive skin i have been using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href eltamd skincare uv daily broad spectrum spf 40 tinted 1 7 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 eltamd skincare uv daily broad spectrum spf 40 tinted , 1 7 oz a nbsp sold to me by my dermatologist i like this much better the eltamd rubs in quicker , but it leaves my face shiny i also saw a study checking how effective different brands are and the eltamd was toward the bottom of the chart it says spf40 but it really was n't i do n't know how this would test in a scientific study , but i would buy this before the eltamd , even with the push from my to buy the stuff they sell
5	where has this stuff been my whole baby hair styling career \? this is just a really light water like cleaner with a really fresh scent mustela has a baby perfume and this smells very similar to me we use this primarily to get the baby 's hair to lay flat after or waking up we 've also used it for midday overall , very versatile and smells fantastic
5	i'm a hot tools fan i 've been working on growing my hair out for quite some time , so i 've been using the hot tools gold 1 inch barrel the first time i curled my short hair with the 1 in i ! my hair was crazy ! the curls did n't start until about 1 2 way down the shaft of my hair and they were n't tight enough my hair dresser told me to get a 3 4 inch inch i 've never used a 3 4 inch before it took forever to curl my hair but my curls were tighter and they gave me more curl and volume at the root i love hot tools they are affordable and heat up fact and get hot i now own a 1 3 4 in , a 1 inch and a 3 4 inch 1 is ceramic , 2 are gold i know that use the gold , but i prefer the ceramic and wish i would have bought this in ceramic for me , i find the hair tends to stick to the gold making it hard to curl the hair the pic below , the top pic is with the 1 inch hot tools , the bottom pic is with the new hot tools 3 4 inch gold plated curling iron
5	it goes on easier than your typical sunscreen and is not heavy at all very light and silky feeling and blends in well not greasy ! has a very faint smell \( smells like sunscreen \) that goes away quickly it smooths the skin like a face primer lotion would makeup goes on nicely after use of this product all thumbs up from me !
5	i generally buy opi , which has a similar price point , and this is a similar product it goes on thick and nice , and lasts a long time honestly , what sets this apart is the bottle shape i hate the round opi bottles they are so painful to store i know that sounds dumb , but i like to have a lot of different colors , and this takes 3 4 of the space just because the bottle is n't round i am sold !
5	a must have color
5	i just watched a video of bobbi brown doing makeup on older women and she showed that using a heavy rich cream is okay , that it plumps up the face well for makeup application i'm one that usually uses that at night but for this last week , i 've used it during the day , under makeup , and it 's not heavy like i imagined it is thick but it does n't feel once your makeup is on i also used less makeup , just a smidge of cc here and there and a bit of concealer the plumping of the skin made my skin look more radiant than usual me , radiant \? \? \? that said , i really like and i'm a price this is a good price for a good cream , others at the makeup counter are much more expensive for example , i last tried an estee lauder heavy cream that was so heavily scented that it made my eyes tear up \( why fragrance in moisturizer \? \? \? \) this has no scent and has a bigger container that feels much nicer and the price was much less it 's not cheap , but even drugstore brands are comparable in price for this have you priced olay or roc lately \? i 'd never considered vichy a bargain brand before but it is great and high quality
5	this special rich rose essential oil can be used for all skin types it has a very pleasant scent we found that it is easy to use and is not oily it penetrates quickly into the skin without clogging pores it is the perfect solution for a smooth and perfect facial skin it smooth the facial skin of some of the age related wrinkles and it continues to work an entire day i recommend this product for women and men of all ages
5	huge bottle , fine mist , very refreshing calms the skin and can be used over make up i love it
5	my daughter has very fine hair and this product helps her achieve the curls she wants in conjunction with the dryer i bought her she is very happy with the product she is 12 and it does burn her hair we do not plug it in , we just put the setting lotion , wait ten minutes then put her under the dryer i bought on here for 20 minutes and the most beautiful curls are created
4	dermablend products are the bomb they cover up scars , acne and discolorations or flaws on your face , but it does n't feel heavy if you want to use it as a sunscreen , you will need to apply every two hours if you want to use as a foundation , you will need to apply in layers and when done , use the powder to finish the look and set the look you can also use lighter shades for highlighting and dark colors for contouring to get that perfect face this product has not caused any irritation to my skin and works extremely well it also comes with a paddle so that you can apply in small amounts where needed
4	my main complaint with this stuff is that it ships in a glass jar that makes it difficult to toss into my bag for traveling that said , just a little bit provides enough control without leaving my hair stiff based on its texture and consistency , i was a little afraid that it would leave my hair looking wet all day , but that is not the case , at least with the amount that i use there is a slight fragrance , but it is more pleasant than not \( a bit of citrus , i guess \) and it does not linger all in all , good stuff i might heat it up a little and pour some into a plastic tube for traveling , though
3	josie by josie natori body lotion is a fairly thin consistency lotion that has a light fruity scent in the squeezable plastic bottle , and is dispensed through a euro dropper type opening it spreads easy and absorbs quickly due to the of the lotion , i do not find it to be very , and the moisture it does supply is not long lasting the fragrance , however , is long lasting , which is not a particularly good thing as i do not care for the scent when i wear it it develops an scent within five minutes of my applying the lotion however , my teen daughter can wear it and it smells very nice on her , slightly fruity and with a hint of vanilla and wood on me , it smells like cheap dollar store pear scented lotion not something i would buy for myself , but if you like the scent , it is a good layering option , especially if you do not really need it to
4	this is a pretty good facial moisturizer ! it has vitamin e and aloe i use it about twice a day and it leaves my skin feeling soft , smooth and most of all not oily the tube is not big so use about a dime sized amount and remember a little goes a long way
5	i am quite fair skinned and have used sunscreens for years what i like best about tizo is the tint , it is not that whitish color smearing on my face only to be reapplied often is thick , maybe due to the zinc oxide , which is n't great but it 's tolerable the price , which is over 40 , i believe could stop sunscreen users tizo has an spf 40 and many high end cosmetics with an spf 25 are more costly thinking of the damage the sun can do to one 's skin cancer , aging and more , 40 is a small price many patients regret they did n't use sunscreens so , despite the fact that you have to re apply every two hours or sooner if swimming or sweating , it will be beneficial it 's worth a try
5	this product is exactly as advertised arrived promptly thank you
3	i want to like this hand lotion more than i do , but i ca n't be very excited about it enough to want to purchase it what 's good about it is it 's a thick , emollient hand lotion that when applied softens my hands but so do many other hand lotions for half the price and at a better scent what makes it not exciting is that for the price at this size \( see photo \) , it does n't live up to that price standard i think the of this hand lotion should give it an exotic spicy scent , or something citrus , or woodsy , so that , like another well known brand sold in hair salons , there is that feeling of decadence or a spa like experience this lotion 's scent is like grandma \( and i'm a grandmother , but i do n't want to smell like my grandmother \) there is also an almost chemical scent to the grandma flowery scent as well , it takes a while for the lotion to soak into my skin , so if i'm at my computer working on a novel , i have to wait a while it 's a little greasy yet , that would n't be so bad since when it does soak in , my hands do feel great so , in general , give this lotion an exotic or scent and or give a little bit more for the money , and i 'd be more inclined to purchase it honestly , just changing the scent would do a lot to my interest in this product
3	i use after using their serum this lotion comes in a nice glass jar , that 's kind of heavy do n't drop it ! the lotion does have some fragrance to it inside the box , there 2 mini to scoop the lotion out the lotion feels nice on my face , and is n't too heavy i have n't noticed any difference using this alongside the serum i 'll keep using it , but would n't purchase another as they 're just too expensive
5	the color has a lot of brown and a slightly noticeable burgundy , a rather nice mixture for fall i would recommend this color in place of red or brown
5	my wife likes the rosy pink shade this delivers you can use it with any loose powder it has no fragrance it hides imperfections if you 're not sure which shade to get , try buy it at a department store that sells it or rely on amazon 's return policy
4	this is a very nice lip gloss that offers sun protection with an spf of 45 the only problem is if you are an avid , plan to use this frequently to prolong your protection i always use lip balm in summer and brutally cold winters frequent application is always a must this is a nice product which goes on with ease and offers sun protection
4	i 've been watching the changes on my 92 year old mother 's neck over a number of weeks using strivectin tightening neck serum daily and do see tighter looking neck skin that looks better than it was using the well designed steel roller makes it easy to apply this product evenly , just squeeze the tube as you roll the wheel over your skin
4	good polish
5	this stuff works great in my fine hair for when i'm curling it i feel like it does protect my hair and keeps my curls in longer does n't make it too stiff or unnatural looking
4	supersmile does a good job does help with teeth whitening so long as you use daily and follow instruction
5	love it ! gives nails a break between colors great for when running out the door and want nails to look finished and pretty much better than clear the secret to no chipping and making this a long lasting finish is to buff your nails slightly before application stays on for a few weeks as a nice polished sheen
5	great color !
5	excellent wash does n't dry out skin really controls cystic acne issues for the over 40 crowd
5	this was part of a nail polish gift package for my sister and she loved it great color ! excellent service too very fast shipping and appropriate packaging
3	great color but it did not last as long on me as cheaper drugstore types it is less drying
5	i 've used boar bristle hair brushes for most of my life but must admit this is the best one by far , my hair is graying so its dry and after washing and conditioning but once i start using this great thick boar brush my hair gets a natural shine without looking oily or greasy , it holds its shape and looks great too ! i wo n't use anything else after being spoiled with the benefits this brush offers the size of this brush is excellent too , i can twist it as i brush adding some wavy to my hair too my only problem is i keep loosing this chair brush , my girlfriend keeps walking off with it because she like it so much , guess 'll buy another one so she can have her own her hair is thin blond that is about shoulder length , she also loves the shine plus the lasting control
4	i am a 42 year old female with fine brown hair that is colored blond , which is cut in a bob to my shoulders i use the product line and have tried almost all of their products i use the color care shampoo and conditioner as my daily routine , and switch to the strengthening shampoo and conditioner \( with the healing oil \) when my hair gets dry and or starts breaking falling out more than usual \( due to a medical condition \) i decided to try the thickening shampoo and matching conditioner to see if it would help my hair is fine and has no volume , but i hate to use a lot of products on it as it always seems to leave a residue or feel greasy by the end of the day thus , i wanted to find a way to plump up my hair with just the shampoo and conditioner where possible you can use this on a daily basis i used it for about 2 weeks every day with the conditioner and within about 4 days , i noticed a difference it just gave my hair more thickness , without it feeling greasy or frozen in place like some do it also made it shiny , which was a nice bonus since that was not my top priority in choosing this product in summary , based on experience , i do keep this in shower and rotate it in my regular routine as i need some plumping of my hair but i do n't use it on a daily basis
4	i have used several different brands of night creams , and was looking for another restorative cream to help out my skin this product claims to strengthen the skin barrier , smooth lines and prevent natural water loss i have felt that this locks in moisture to help ensure it lasts my skin has felt more moisturized without feeling greasy i feel like my skin tone is brighter , and am hoping that it really is helping with my wrinkles as well
5	should have bought this years ago my hair is very thick and this iron actually works on it and holds for a few days
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i'm very happy that i tried this dermablend quick fix body full coverage stick ! i had a small but very specific need i recently had a scrape of a questionable on my chest \( benign and normal , thankfully ! \) this has left a 1 2 bright pink spot of brand new skin which is very obvious when i wear a v or scoop neckline daily sunscreen still does n't cover this unsightly , sensitive spot but the dermablend does cover it 100 it stays on all day with zero smearing it also it from any sun damage , which could permanently discolor the new skin since i had great luck with it , i tried it on other discolored areas of my body , and it worked equally well i am so satisfied with this product ! it washes right off when i shower i 've always known about dermablend , but now i have become a devoted customer
4	i like the hydrate poo much better the perfect for platinum leaves my hair too greasy , so i try using less and using the hydrate for the second shampooing in the same washing of my hair
3	i love the packaging for euphoria its in a space age type bottle and the contents are lavender the bottle is on both sides providing a handy place for your thumbs to hold on to i often get serious headaches from scents but that was not the case with euphoria i cant say i love the overly sweet smell however its not overpowering but even a little spritz lasts a long time
5	love zoya polish ! i use the base and top coat along with 2 coats of polish i can usually go 2 weeks without a chip and it is easy to remove the polish also knowing it is 5 free brings peace of mind !
5	i prefer a creamy formula that does not have a strong perfume , and this lipstick more than met my expectations it goes on extremely smooth and has a rich feel , but does n't creep into fine lines the color is a lovely pink and stayed true for a decent length of time one warning one persons very creamy moisturizing formula can too greasy for another if you dislike the feel of lip glass you may have issues with this lipstick i 'll add that the case is elegant with a substantial weight
3	i was excited to get this , but my major issue is that it off not sure if that is dead skin and it did its job \? \? but it also does n't absorb well so , the scent is not overpowering , little feminine this lotion is just okay ,
4	this is a pretty decent moisturizing lotion , though it is a bit pricey the good news is that it is nearly scent free \( when dry \) and does n't leave your skin feeling oily at all it dries clear , of course , and leaves your skin feeling nice and smooth i have been using it on the , driest spots on my body hands , elbows , knees and feet it seems to work just as well as some other moisturizers i use \( from milk co , neutrogena , and eucerin \) because it is significantly more expensive than most other brands , however , i probably wo n't be ordering this again , and this is the main reason i am giving this a four star rating , as opposed to a five star rating
5	arrived as expected great tool !
4	this is the second la roche posay product i 've tried and i'm becoming a fan this product goes on smooth with a minimum smell to interfere with any perfume you might be wearing , the only problem is that this particular color has too much yellow tint for my complexion i 'll probably use it for face contouring and or on my neck maybe even on my shoulders if i 'll be sending lots of time outdoors
4	this is the third foundation type product i 've used from la roche posay , and i really like it the texture is like an airy whipped cream , but it dries down to a matte finish another reviewer noted that it sat on her skin , but i always use a foundation primer \( too faced 's primed and poreless \) underneath my foundations , and doing so makes this glide right on it does n't sink into my pores , and provides a nice , smooth finish i also really like that it provides light coverage , so it would be good to use if you do n't like to wear foundation
4	the liftactiv , which is made and manufactured in france , has a pleasant consistency and scent i found that this product does in fact have a firming effect upon the skin , and the effect was not due to any sort of irritation or ill reaction to the cream while the jury is still out on the small line removal , the claim of firming action does appear to be the glass jar comes in a mirror finish cardboard box
4	i 've been using the meg 21 cell therapy anti oxidant boost serum for just a few days and will update after 3 weeks \( to address their claim \) i am also experimenting on the back of one hand to have a more accurate comparison i have extremely sensitive skin that is very dry being post menopausal , i lost what little moisture i had plus i live in a area with extremely low \( or \) humidity i am scent sensitive as well the skin on my face is soaks up moisture \( as if it is which it may be \) out of the , the scent of this product is faint and for my sensitivity the initial scent strength fades quickly , but does remain in my acceptable range the scent flavor is of the perfumy type \( very light \) vs citrus or medicinal what i like a lot is that this serum spreads smoothly , dries quickly , and leaves a silky sheen without appearing \( or feeling \) oily greasy high here i appreciate my skin feeling and appearing hydrating without a greasy covering 30 minutes after applying both \( as of this writing \) , my face and the back of my right hand feel slightly cooler to the touch with a lovely pleasurable soft feel both feel moisturized which is a plus i have lots of fine \( and not so fine \) lines on my face with its 64 years mostly due to starting with dry skin \( age related moisture loss residence weather \) i have no of losing all the lines , but am interested in giving my facial skin the help and health i can other reviewers \( and the description on amazon \) do a complete job in the science and trials info so i will not repeat here the bottle is small \( 1 oz \) under 5 high very nicely packaged simple , elegant the opening inner cap is a new interesting design twist one way and the inner pump dispenser lifts up twist the opposite and the dispenser back into the silver outer cap \( handy for travel prevention \) nice , light , and easy to hold and operate recommended to be applied twice each day onto clean skin \( the follow up moisturizer is also suggested , but i have only the serum to review \) of course , what shoppers want to know does it work as advertised , is it worth the price \( current on amazon 95 \) , and how long does it last \? i am sorry to make you wait but , i 'll be back in mid to late september to update
5	please see review in oribe for brilliance and shine conditioner , working perfect together with light moisturizing cream and gold lust hair oil for my mid length , naturally curly , dry , freeze prune hair , and use of t3 hair dryer , making hair look very healthy
5	the word peel me when it comes to a face product , but this one has eased my mind looking at the ingredients , it seems like something you could almost eat , so i felt good about putting it on my face it gives a cool , tingling effect , and my face felt like new after i used it this is the only peel that will be coming near me !
5	shampoo is best , hands down , for preserving the life of your color and just making your hair look and smell amazing worth the cost
5	i 've tried every davines shampoo and conditioner and hated them all this was the last one i had to try before writing off the whole line as worthless first , i loved the scent very clean and fresh second and more importantly , this left my hair so soft and shiny ! i'm thrilled with the results ! my only beef is they do n't fill the containers all the way up
5	i love the price on this and the quality of this brand polish is great stays on and is very true to color i deep blood red !
5	this product is exactly as advertised arrived promptly thank you
5	beautiful colors by opi infinite shine collection
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
3	this make up is very thick and can even appear cakey it would be good for those who really need to cover up marks on their face you do not need a lot in order to cover because the make up is dense it does not have a perfumed odor and the make up itself is matte so it does not have a shine those who want or need a heavy quality make up might like this
5	beauty box
4	this is the first time my wife attempted this on her face and the results were good the comments i received were all positive it does have a light scent which can be overpowering for some but in my opinion the product does smells nice , my wife reported that her skin does feel supple smooth after removal of the facial clay mask the mineral clay mask which consists of two ultra fine white clay with vichy 's proprietary mineral water leaves your face smooth and feels good there were no itchy sensations reported by my wife who is very sensitive to other skin care products i personally liked the jar and the mirror top finish which doubles as makeup mirror on the go i am sure my wife will save the bottle jar to store other skincare products on the go for later use rating this product with four stars !
4	i absolutely hate straightening my hair i do n't like doing anything with my hair and most of the time i just wash it and let it air dry because i hate spending time and energy on it this straight iron may help change that i waited until my hair was dry \( the instructions say to use it on dry hair \) and then followed the directions for fine hair i was pleasantly surprised by how quickly this straightened my hair this straightener also comes with clips to section your hair and a little felt pad to rest the hot tool on the reason i am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the heated part is only 4 inches long , instead of being spread along the entire length of the straightener , which would have straightened my hair even faster
5	i love the smell , it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft !
4	this provides nice cover up just tap it on the area you 're covering until you 're satisfied for longer lasting coverage , it 's suggested to use their setting powder i received color beige 30c for reviewing purposes it 's a little darker than mary kay ivory 6 keep in mind where you plan on using dermablend quick fix for example , my legs , arms and face are different shades
5	love this product it covers red areas better than anything i have used i used the loose powder in the same shade for my neck and jawline but this one is better for red areas around nose and eyes
5	it was over a week before they began to chip
5	i use this with uv light and the base top coat from cnd looks and holds like the shellacks i get at the salon
5	i like to have cleansing cloths in my bathroom for when i come home from a night out i am almost always too tired to do a complicated makeup removal cleansing cloths make it much easier and quicker i have been using them for years , but this is my first time trying them from skyn i love how the iceland glacial cloths soothe my eyes they are so relaxing on tired skin i think i may even start using them after long nights at work when my eyes are sore too i did feel a tiny bit of burning in my eye however , i think that is because i was trying to get every bit of my eye makeup off including my eyeliner the only issue that i have with these cloths is that they are really only best for the eyes if i am wearing eye makeup , i am also wearing face makeup that needs to be removed i tried to use these cloths on my face and the icy hot feeling irritated my facial skin it turned my face bright red and inflamed it was fine again the next morning , but i am not going to use them on my face again so , i really have to use two cloths if i use these to remove makeup after a night out other than that , i really like the soothing effect
4	leaves skin feeling soft and definitely clean it 's good for my sensitive combination skin i would recommend although , it is a bit more money than i would generally pay for this sort of product but you do get what you pay for with a high quality product that cleans and is truly gentle on your skin
5	this is great cleansing water ! it does a very good job , without feeling greasy or leaving a film on my face ! i would buy this again
3	while i like the coolness of the roll on \( it feels really good , especially in the summer \) , i do n't like the uber strong fragrance it smells like something my mother might have used in the definitely an older lady smell that took over and made me regret putting it on my face i definitely need anti aging products i'm middle aged and would n't mind decreasing wrinkles but the fragrance will not go away i could be more enthusiastic about the product if it came unscented
5	with these new nail products promising a long lasting manicure , you really do n't have to go to the salon anymore ! i applied the top coat \( which is clear \) to my existing plum colored nails and it kept it from chipping for a week my only caveat is the price you could buy the sally hansen miracle gel top coat for half that price and it will do almost as good a job the main difference is the drying time londontown gel dries much faster than sally hensen and it gives my nails a nice gloss so if you do n't mind paying a little extra , the londontown gel is faster and looks a little nicer
3	i wanted to like this but i think it just does n't suit my thin hair i also do n't love misty sprays i tend to get the aerosol it smells great but i found it to be a little heavy and sticky
5	this is for sensitive skin i used this to remove my makeup and works great nice clean smell , not greasy feeling and wipes off nicely got black eyeliner off which is a great test for me i used this one with water says you can use it without but i have found i need to make sure all cleaners are off my skin due to drying and breaking out problems but works great and is a product i would use every day
3	this looks lovely , though is very delicate and to be honest , i prefer the control you get with a normal \( card \) file better
5	addicted this stuff is the bomb !
1	this hair spray has a very strong smell even with two small sprays , the smell lasted for hours it smells like a strong perfume a grandmother would wear that would overpower everyone i really did not detect a tobacco smell the hold is not as good as my wifes regular pump hairspray either
5	be sure to buy this nail lacquer from butter london and not from shop adorn ! ! butter london is a quality product , but shop adorn sent me old , thick , streaky bl nail lacquer
5	this is not a misting spray it is a serum type of bottle that squeezes out the perfect amount of moisturizer for one application the design of the bottle is clean and easy to use this was your eyes are soaked to the skin very quickly it is smooth and yummy i am able to put my foundation on immediately after applying this moisturizer i really wish you could test moisturizers to see if the spf is legit i hope it is living in florida you need a good spf lotion daily this one is light , not heavy i detect no smell , but i also did n't it to find out this one is a bit pricey compared to others the active ingredients are zinc oxide and octinoxate not sure what the latter one is must apply 30 minutes before sun exposure
5	i love to have candles around for and to add a pleasant scent to the house or just one room the baxter noir candle in cassis is very eye catching in its design , as even the carton was unique with its embossed text and textured paper the candle wax is just as jet black as appears in the photo , which in person really stands out the other candles when burning , the scent was an excellent amount that filled up a large area \( living room and room \) which a slightly citrusy and fig aroma that was not overly sweet or overbearing in any way i 've found many candles do n't always burn so evenly , however the baxter one after about 2 3 hours of initial burn , is looking as smooth on the surface as when it was new
4	i have been using the juice green apple peel for 5 or more years and i swear by it if you have sensitive , acne prone and rosacea prone skin this peel is wonderful the clear skin kit is perfect for other juice products or having travel sized products i am equally in love with the cleanser finding it gentle yet treating i am not impressed with the moisturizer , it feels a bit sticky and irritates my sensitive skin i do like the blemish clearing lotion but i only apply it every other day because \( again \) sensitive skin ! !
5	love it
5	update july 3 , 2016 it has come to my attention that triclosan is no longer an ingredient in this product i do n't know if it was removed in response to my negative comments about it in my review or not but since it has apparently been removed , that 's good news and potentially bad news the removal of triclosan my negative comment but now that the formulation has changed , and i have not tried the new formulation , i do n't know if it 's as effective a product as what i originally tested for the last several years i 've been using deodorants rather than anti there are several reasons why i 've done this but the primary reason was i do not want to use a product containing aluminum anymore because of the to disease that numerous studies have indicated i was also interested in not trying to alter my bodies natural ability to perspire antiperspirants block the pores from being able to sweat a deodorant is simply going to help prevent odor caused by bacteria companies try different ways to accomplish that either by fragrance to cover up the odor , some form of absorbing ingredient like baking soda , some sort of anti bacteria agent , or some combination of these of all the products i used over the last several years , none have effectively worked for more than a few hours it was very frustrating i tried a tom 's of maine product , another product called naturally fresh and several others along the same idea none of them worked for me very well this menscience advanced fragrance free deoderant is the first one that has truly worked all day for me and then some i can apply this first thing in the morning and at the end of the day it is still effectively preventing underarm odor it applies easily and does n't require you to flap your arms around for a minute or two to dry before you can put your shirt on it 's fragrance free \( although there is a hint of a smell due to the ingredients used , but it is very very minimal \) and is not sticky it just works some people have complained of irritation i have not experienced any irritation while using this deoderant at all for me it works perfectly my only reservation is that it contains triclosan triclosan has been used for years in soaps and other products it is an anti bacterial agent and although there is no hard evidence at this time that it is harmful to humans , the fda has been reviewing the use of triclosan at this point i'm willing to use a product that has triclosan in it until there is some firm evidence that it might be hazardous in some way i suspect it is the addition of triclosan that makes this deoderant so effective i am very happy with this deoderant i like that it is fragrance free and that is works all day for me it is not an antiperspirant so if you are looking for something that will help with excessively , this will not help you , but for most people with normal perspiration , this is worth a shot , it sure works for me i was provided a sample for review
2	i really wanted to like this product because besides being a perfect color match , it really evened out my skin tone and gave me the most amazing glow at least when looking in my house bathroom mirror i did n't see a single sparkle just a lovely sheen that made my skin look like it was glowing from within i was by how perfect it made my complexion look that i was certain i had found my ca n't live beauty product fast forward to later that afternoon while running errands i took a glance up in my car mirror and was shocked to see that apparently , a glitter bomb had on my face i looked like a sparkly disco ball ! i gave this another try the following day using just a smidge but it still was way too sparkly in sunlight would only possibly wear this product in the evening and even then i'm not sure it 'd be worth it if there were any chance of flash photography or having to walk into a well lit with my girlfriends i may get some use out of this as a highlighter for my cheekbones or legs but at my age , this type of sparkle is a big no no for all over face use the sparkles accentuate all the things i want to keep hidden in daylight ! fine lines , pores , imperfections it only looks good under lighting conditions update i hate throwing out perfectly good products and just wanted to share that i did find a use for this as a highlighter after applying makeup , a quick swipe down the center of my nose gives the bridge of my nose the perfect contoured look without all the work of contouring no need to blend ! i also use a dab on my 's bow to highlight my lips and as a highlighter on my cheekbones brow bones when used this way , the shimmer does n't overwhelm your face and sink into pores fine lines i 'll probably have this at the rate i'm using it \( just a smidge here and there \) but it 's pretty much become a staple in my daily beauty routine i would n't feel put together and polished without it \)
3	i 've tried a lot of night creams , both expensive and not , and all work , albeit it in different degrees the primary difference between the premium brands and the common ones is generally found in the ingredient list if you showed me this erno lazlo ingredient list without telling me what the product was , i 'd swear that this was olay it contains everything that women are trying to avoid these days silicone , petroleum products , and parabens that said , those do condition skin , except for those who have developed sensitivity to those ingredients in an expensive cream , though , i look for ingredients that are gentler on my skin while still providing moisture and care at least the fragrance is not overbearing and is more in line with an expensive product despite my disappointment with the ingredients , this cream does indeed moisturize like most night creams , this one is thick and white it goes on smoothly \( thanks in part to silicone \) , and , while it requires a bit more blending than a lighter day cream might , it absorbs fairly quickly use it sparingly you do n't need a lot i love that it comes with a little plastic scoop to keep my fingers out of it even though it is with parabens , you do n't want to introduce bacteria that could turn it prematurely this night cream works i was just hoping for something a little more special given the brand and the price point debbie lee wesselmann
4	really pretty blue color , perfect summer color nail polish
5	light , refreshing , slightly tart i think of it as a spring and summer scent
4	i stopped using hair products when my hair started thinning especially because most products were n't thick enough or were too greasy i wanted to try something high end and after reading the description that this was geared for thin hair , i had to try i'm pleasantly surprised how it worked it did n't make my hair greasy , did n't make it look like i sprayed gloss in it a little goes a long way so do n't use too much the scent is a powder vanilla its strong at first and you can for a few hours then it lessens and slowly fades the hold is not too strong but not too weak , just the right amount for me it does n't feel stiff or crunchy , its firm but i like this much better than the axe or bed head i 've tried so many and they all do n't work or are too heavy and make you look like you had a hat on all day this one really does a nice job in keeping your style and not looking wet , hard , or flat its a little pricey but again , a little goes a long way so it will last you
5	the day life cosmetic palette has more conservative colors than some of the others offered by this brand and would be a good choice to give to a young lady who is old enough to wear makeup , but who is still experimenting to find shades that complement her natural good looks they tend to be lightly pigmented and understated there are four girl 's day out , coffee break , weekend brunch , and day dreaming the individual pans can be removed and carried in the travel sized compact a dual brush is also included the quality is comparable to reasonably priced makeup from a drugstore for those not in the know , michelle phan is a makeup artist who to the younger set with a channel devoted to her show on youtube the em michelle phan cosmetics are from l'oreal
1	first , the color shown here , which looks like a soft apricot , was actually a garish orange my toes look like i am wearing orange peel ! second , as another reviewer mentioned , the polish goes on streaky , and it was only after much effort , and much time , that i was able to achieve some semblance of coverage i have never thrown out a polish , but this one i did i think i will stick to opi polishes , they have a better quality overall as for this essie polish complete fail , i hated it ! !
4	this polish is hard to get despite its popularity for the last 3 4 years that is why a purchase two bottles in case this color will be discontinue \( which i hope not \) its the real essie polish no problems with the delivery and the package was secure amazon did it once again
5	this has a very light texture like a lotion , not a cream consistency it has a slight smell of the benzoyl peroxide it absorbs really fast , and after a minute or two you feel the tingling burning sensation on your skin for my wife it was about a 5 minute long sensation obviously different skin types may react differently , but it does n't leave her skin red like some other treatments she has tried using 10 creams in the past , but they are too strong and cause a bad skin reaction and redness this 5 mixture is the right balance for her skin compared to other benzoyl peroxide acne treatments , this does not dry your skin that much , but still is effective at reducing the acne it gave noticeable results and clearer skin after just 1 week the downside of this cream , like others , is that it increases your sun sensitivity , so you may need to take extra precautions to protect your skin of all the acne treatments my wife has used \( at least a half dozen brands \) , this is the most effective she 's used yet however , if she stopped using it for a day or two , the skin condition but she was extremely satisfied with the results a minor caution while using benzoyl peroxide treatments , they can discolor , like pillow cases , so use a cheap one ! another acne treatment with similar results but that does n't affect sun sensitivity so much is the brand with \( 20 \) but this cream is mostly available in europe i have not found it in the usa yet
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	not bad , trying it out for the first time
4	while this bubble bath is not overly bubbly it did feel good on my skin which has been drying out lately due to the weather i also have sensitive skin and react to perfumes and some chemicals to the point where my breathing can be this feels great on my skin and does not cause any reactions on my skin or effect my breathing in any way i also use this as a shower gel because it feels so nice on my body this is great for a nice calming bubble bath at my age bubbles are not a big thing relaxing in a hit tub of water which feels nice on my skin is all i want it is also great as a shower gel if you are getting this for a child or adult who likes lots of bubbles they may want more bubbles
4	really useful for cold wintery days when my newborn needed that extra boost of moisture in his skin i find it is also useful for the we are having now as the ac is on almost 24 7 and hence the air in the house is pretty dry at the moment \( he is now 6 months old and we are still using it \) the mustela stelatopia range has proved to be really useful for my eczema prone little one 's skin especially with the change in weather we want a product we can rely on that will not cause further irritation to his already super dry skin
5	fab product ! love this color !
2	looks pretty , pink , and creamy with strawberry seeds as described expected a lovely strawberry smell , but just smelled like lotion also felt like a cream lotion did nothing at all followed up with my clean and clear scrub to get the job done
5	i do not always make the time to use the trinity itself because putting on all the gel to use the device is not my fav thing to do ! and i use aloe , not the goop that nuface sells ! i can always find time to use this wrinkle remover device ! so easy and i really see the results in fewer brown spots and fine lines you have to hold this on each section of your face for 3 min and you need to do this 5 days per week i would be very surprised if someone commit to using this as stated and they did not see some positive difference in their skin it does use the battery up in your trinity much faster than the device so charge often !
5	i 've used a few vichy products and find this to be a nice one too its a bit thin so squeeze with care ! i also found it to absorb quickly i am using this on the backs of my hands , i have that certain age brown spots starting up i know it will take more than a week of use to have them fade , so i will have to come back and make changes , if need be , on my rating the thing that pleased me is i have very dry and sensitive skin and just the fact that it did n't irritate my skin is great ! very lightly scented , but i wish all cosmetic companies would just leave scents out of all products all in all , i am pleased with this product and hope that this will fade the spots , if they do not , i will be back to change the star rating
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	absolutely love this polish ! ! ! it stains the nails so be sure to use a good basecoat but love it !
3	the foundation is very light weight i loved that it did n't even feel like i had make up on the part i did n't like was that it did n't cover well for me i would have liked it to cover a bit more than it did , but other than that , i'm pretty happy with the product not sure if i would pay full price for it , though
5	love this brand
3	i wanted to give this 2 stars when i first opened it and saw how little i received for a price list of 24 ! i was unimpressed but , after applying it \( despite the scent i did n't care for \) , i was ready to give it a chance , since it did seem to set my makeup maybe it 's not this product \? but , i do n't see the tint they are talking about i sprayed some on my inner arm and looked with a bright light and i just do n't see it looks clear to me which is not a problem for me as i 'd not want a tint over my makeup it did irritate my skin a little where i applied it on my inner arm , though it did n't on my face so \? mystery to me i suppose i just do n't get these types of beauty products because i'm not a girly girl who spends a lot of money on certain cosmetic type products for which i ca n't tell whether they are doing me any good or not , and charging too much to do it while i 'll spend extra on serums and face creams and maybe my foundation , these type of products are to me this is my second bliss product to try the first was an oxygen mist for which the scent was wonderful and it felt great spritz on my face , but it was 38 a bottle ! way too much for my budget that 's how i feel about this bliss product 24 for a small can \( see photo it is a tiny can \) of product is too much for my budget for something i 'll likely not use enough to warrant the cost i tested this setting spray by first applying my makeup , spraying the bliss , waiting a second \( it dried very fast ! \) , and then dabbing with a tissue to see how much makeup came off not much ! i swiped a little harder and a little more came off but not much i was impressed i then went for a hike \( this is summer as i write this \) and up the mountain so i 'd break a sweat i then dabbed my face again and was impressed that not much came off on the tissue i was considering giving it 4 stars despite the ridiculous price though , i will say here that i did n't care for the scent a kind of alcohol smell that followed me around for a while it does dissipate and for that i'm glad it reminded me of those old hair sprays not pleasant \( however , their bliss oxygen mist , , smelled so good and fresh ! they should use the same scent for this product ! \) then once home , i washed off the spray and makeup \( washes off easily by the way \) and applied the same amount of makeup , but this time i did not spray the bliss setting spray i let my makeup set and then i did the tissue test about the same amount of makeup came off i then spritzed my face to moisten it , to mimic sweat , and there was n't that much difference in the tissues of spray vs not spray i conclude that the setting spray works a little bit , but not in the way here i am completely sure about it perhaps the proof is in whether the makeup stays on longer throughout your day or evening since i work from home , i do n't wear makeup all day i suppose it could have its merits for long travel or a long night and i 'll try it out when i travel i'm also going to let my friends who live in a very humid climate try it out and see what they think if they report back they love it , i 'll update my review so with the testing of with spray and without spray there was a little bit of difference but not enough for me to be excited about at this price just as with the bliss oxygen mist spray , if they 'd lower the price , i 'd be interested in purchasing it but at 24 for this tiny can , i think i 'd find a less expensive alternative if i felt the need for a setting spray if you live in a humid climate i'm in the mountains and do not and if you do n't mind spending a little more on products that probably have some good ingredients in them , you may benefit from this product
5	calvin klein has managed to create a fragrance whose complexity , depth and longevity have made it my favorite men 's fragrance other reviewers its freshness , its clean aroma and its , which are all valid observations but what struck me the very first time i sprayed it on after shaving was its aromatic depth and complexity it has spice and wood overtones at first but these soon deepen into a cinnamon musk cedar aroma that is very appealing the aroma lingers for quite some time without losing much of its early intensity i also found this after shave spray exceptionally bracing and soothing on the skin , something that is often overlooked in the merits of high quality after shaves with an appealing aroma that lasts for several hours and its soothing freshness on the skin , calvin klein has created an excellent after shave spray in eternity now
4	to be fair , i only started using this about three weeks ago , on the heels of using oz natural serums , including the vitamin c with hyaluronic acid which i thought made a difference on my skin while this juice beauty smelled great and did moisturize my skin , i'm not seeing any results as far as defying age goes i like that one of the moisturizers has spf 15 i like that the entire skin support kit is here , from cleansing to serum , to moisturizer to mask
4	the neon color is very true to the picture definitely a irreplaceable shade to everyone 's summer collections
5	i have been really stepping up my facial routine because im in my mid 40s i have been using a 10 aha acid exfoliator for a little while and i can already tell that my skin is looking better my pores are tighter , cleaner and my skin looks smoother i have always heard great things about strivectin labs products , not just reviews but clinical studies have reported good things i was very excited to try the strivectin labs glycolic peel it interested me because it is 10 aha acid which was recommended to me by a skin specialist but also claims that it is quick and gentle i have pretty dry skin so although i want a thorough exfoliation to reveal better skin , i do n't want something that is going to dry out or irritate my skin the strivectin labs glycolic peel comes as a 2 step process you get 2 tubes of good sized product each tube is 1 7 oz according to research , products that comes in tubes or pumps are better for skin care because active ingredients start to break down and become less effective when exposed to air open jars can also allow bacteria in so the tube application is good step 1 is a detoxifying primer you apply on a clean face and allow to and prime your skin for 1 minute do not rinse immediately follow with step 2 step 2 is the aha activator you apply over the primer that you already applied from the first tube you leave on for 3 to 5 minutes rinse off when time is up it was easy to do and i did n't find anything unpleasant aha can produce stinging , especially if you have any broken or irritated skin but nothing unpleasant results i have to say that i am very impressed although i have already been using a 10 aha exfoliation , i think since this sits on the skin in a thicker mask that it really kicks up the exfoliation process my pores pushed out things that i did n't even know were there ive had small places on my face that were n't quite blemishes but were small raised areas later in the day , these places had pushed out grease and dirt that is saying a lot since my older , very dry skin does n't seem to produce enough oil any longer to really keep my pores cleaned out on their own it says that you can use 1 2 times a week for best results im using twice a week and will continue to do so my skin looks better than it has in awhile
5	beautiful color !
5	been using this product for years to improve thinning hair
2	i do n't have porcelain skin and i do n't have olive skin , i have medium skin so when i ordered a medium concealer i expected to receive something for medium skin this is actually better for someone between porcelain and medium it 's far , far too light for my skin tone and ends up making my under eyes and chin look weird when i use it i also do n't like how oily creamy it feels it 's just too slippery for my taste and i 'd rather see something that stays put rather than slides around not much of me wants to continue using the product
5	these work i wear them before any event to make myself look more awake , and people notice immediately i always get are you wearing makeup \? questions after i 've used these worth a try !
4	this eau de parfum has a very light fragrance it is reminiscent of flowery cotton , but it is so light that after a couple hours when i held my wrist up to my friend to ask if she could smell it she could not this is wonderful for those who are sensitive and hate those elevator scents it comes in a handsome spray bottle the lotion that comes in the package also has this light scent but the lotion itself is very runny i would use it for the scent to rub on my skin , but as for it to be used as an effective lotion for skin softening body lotion for example it would have to have a creamier thicker base the box makes a nice gift set and for those who like light fragrances this would be a good choice
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
5	i love mario badescu products ! i have combination skin and use this on particularly oily days very nice , gentle and a little goes a long way
4	both lotions smell very nice , not over powering and wo n't compete with your perfume if you wear one i chose this because my skin is super sensitive and i figured if it 's safe for a pregnant woman , it 's safe for any woman , right \? plus , if it will plump up your breasts , why not your face \? if it 'll remove stretch marks , why not crows feet \? for the bust cream i ca n't say that i 've noticed the differences advertised \( no plumping \) and in checking the ingredients , this scores pretty low on the toxicity scale , which is nice it 's not greasy , feels great when you put it on and i do believe that moisturizer is going to help you feel better and helps keep your skin young looking bust firming serum aqua water eau , peg 6 , butylene glycol , dextrin , 1 , 2 hexanediol , phenyl trimethicone , acrylates c10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer , peg 40 hydrogenated castor oil , glyceryl caprylate , hydrolyzed soy protein , dimethicone phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer , parfum \( fragrance \) , xanthan gum , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil , sodium hydroxide , glucose , sophora japonica fruit extract , centella asiatica extract , sorbitol , hydrolyzed avocado protein , maltodextrin , pentylene glycol , citric acid , lupinus albus seed extract , ci 47005 \( yellow 10 \) , ci \( red 40 \) , tocopherol this again is a nice smelling , non greasy moisturizer will it prevent stretch marks \? well , stretch marks are genetic so i would be interested in learning about a lotion , potion or cream that could actually do that ! but again , using moisture on skin that is stretching quickly will make it feel better and certainly can help with the awful itchiness that can start when the belly really starts to pop out there so i would be cautious in believing this will fend off stretch marks science just does n't support that but it 's a nice lotion stretch marks prevention cream aqua water eau , di c12 13 alkyl malate , ethylhexyl cocoate , cetearyl alcohol , dicaprylyl carbonate , hydrolyzed soy protein , butylene glycol , cera alba beeswax cire dabeille , laureth 23 , galactoarabinan , butyrospermum parkii \( shea \) butter , glyceryl stearate , 1 , 2 hexanediol , cetyl alcohol , cetearyl glucoside , glyceryl caprylate , parfum \( fragrance \) , xanthan gum , cetyl palmitate , cocoglycerides , sclerotium gum , zinc gluconate , pentylene glycol , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed oil , sophora japonica fruit extract , hydrolyzed avocado protein , maltodextrin , citric acid , lupinus albus seed extract , tocopherol
5	love it !
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
3	i the scientific in the description i really do n't expect skin creams to do all the things they claim , i'm judging this on the basis of does it moisturize without irritation or other negative effects \? the dispenser is actually irritating the 2 sides do not dispense evenly , so one will run out faster the cream itself has a heavier fragrance than i 'd like it is very moisturizing , on the of feeling oily i'm surprised this is considered a day cream i use it sparingly at night on my slightly dry skin and i feel very moisturized since it does n't take much , it will last awhile i'm not familiar with the company , but it seems you 're paying a lot for the name and packaging it 's an effective moisturizer at too high a price
5	really cute color for summer

2	i was surprised to receive red nailpolish this picture is deceiving i was expecting a pink color it shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate
3	i did n't really care for this primer it did provide some coverage and helped my makeup stay on with the help of setting powder however , it my makeup started fading rubbing off just three hours in this primer also made me look paler i also felt it was unusually thick , almost like a foundation that said , it does what it 's supposed to it just was n't my favorite
5	love this stuff premium hand cream , lovely scent
5	i 've been using this cleanser for about four months , and am happy to see that it 's available on amazon now since it 's become increasingly hard to track down i have sensitive skin that can easily turn red or feel tight if i use a cleanser that is too strong , and this one is very soothing when i come home from work , i still use an oil cleanser \( clinique 's take the day off \) as a first step , but then i use this as a second cleanser , and it seems to remove any last of makeup your skin actually feels soothed and moisturized , rather than tight i love all the vichy products i 've tried , and this is another great one to try if you have sensitive skin
5	always use this product on my face in the evening
5	micellar cleansing water has proven to be a fantastic product for my complexion i only wish this had been around when i was a teen i'm middle aged , but still have acne flare ups the thought of using a cleansing water and not rinsing my face , just sounded like it would n't work for me i'm glad i tried it anyway i poured some on a cotton pad , wiped away makeup and that 's it ! it makes my face soft , clean and it clears up my acne fast it 's convenient , no excuse for leaving on makeup pleased to find this formula for oily complexions this is the best ! recommended
3	this is a review for japonesque pixelated color eyelighter , shade 02 the product application color was just as expected it was very easy to apply , all you have to do is twist the end of the almost permanent marker size looking pen type applicator and after few clicks you will find the color coming out of the brush use the pen lightly apply it underneath the eye where the black circles generally appear , and then dab with your fingertip to blend the color into those areas you need to conceal it does work okay in concealing the areas which makes your face look dull overall okay product rating with 3 stars !
4	my wife wo n't put any chemicals or weird things on her skin she sticks primarily to pure oil products that do n't contain things such as alcohol or preservatives she has tried vichy a number of times after bathing and found it pleasant , but she feels on its benefits it is always difficult to determine whether certain products are really having a positive effect this would include things such as skin care products , vitamins and food supplements it can only be on a subjective level which is prone to all kinds of variables unless something has immediately caused a bad reaction or problem tough to tell it seems that there is nothing bad in the vichy , which is why she agreed to try it so far she says its nice
5	i used this treatment on damp hair after shampooing just a few drops is all that 's needed for my below shoulder length hair it and acts as a heat protectant because it contains a lot of silicone i then use my regular styling products on top of it i did n't get any frizz , even in the florida humidity it worked like a charm i'm impressed with this product and may decide to make it a regular part of my routine i definitely recommend it
5	this oil based cleanser is amazing ! it feels and looks like oil when i pump it out of the container when i rub it into my face , it turns milky and non oily as soon as i add some water it really does seem to deep clean without leaving any oily film my skin just feels clean and it can handle waterproof and long wearing makeup easily ! even stubborn mascara ! usually , i have to scrub that off with this , there is a gentle rub or two , and it is gone ! i really like this cleanser ! it is like nothing else i have ever used ! my skin feels fresh and soft afterwards it has made a difference in my skin ! and it is cost effective , because a few drops go a long way
5	i have been using this product since 1995 it is the first thing i put on my face every morning and some days it is the only thing it never feels greasy and is a great sun protectant
5	love this fun color i get tired of only pink and red shades this was a great way to mix it up without the color being too young looking for this 30 something woman ! \)
3	the color of jouer whitney is bright pink in the tube but more subtle when applied , since it goes on sheer the texture is fine but not especially creamy the color is better for cool toned , light skinned complexions instead of warmer complexions it 's not neutral but it 's also subdued enough for everyday or daytime use
4	this bliss brightening kit works very well i am finding that the cleanser though gentle is a bit drying as is the peel pads but the included vitamin c cream works to sooth the dryness the cleanser and the cream are full sized products but there are only 5 peel pads in the kit the peel pads are very well saturated and i 've used one peel pad per week i use a quarter of it and then fold it up and put it back into the pack and it keeps nicely until my next application this product reduces pores , refines fine wrinkles and cleanses and moisturizes wonderfully i am more used to using a face cleanser that has some exfoliating but when i use a sponge , this cleanser , while drying , works great for me all in all , this is a great kit for more mature skin
4	this is a really nice , emollient cream , but it 's a bit too greasy for my tastes i 've been using it for about two weeks now , and each time i use it , i have a hard time getting it to stay just on my cuticles and nail beds it leaves my entire finger tip greasy , which then makes it hard to use my phone or computer i 've switched to using it at night before bed , but i actually still prefer my solar oil , which sinks in right away it does make a noticeable difference in my nails and cuticles , especially this time of year , when winter is so drying i 'd recommend it for nighttime use
5	tried this because my dermatologist recommended it loved it so much i bought some here for my best friend \( and one for me too \) i could see a noticeable difference it is like my skin drinks it in this is amazing stuff i love it i wash my face first with the facial cleanser it is really something
5	i 've been using this moisture cream for almost a week i love it ! my skin feels soft , and looks radiant ! i give this five stars and a big thumbs up !
3	this stuff worked ok on my wife while other rosaliac creams have worked better my wife found the creams to be too thick and too strong scented to be used regularly and i agree as i can smell it almost as much as her perfume i would recommend the ar intense hydrating serum by la roche posay , instead
5	i ordered this to cover blemishes and redness on my face it works perfectly for that always dab , do n't rub because rubbing will only apply a thin coat that does n't cover well if i ca n't get enough on there , i will rub some on and then dab it with my hard concealer brush i like to use a darker color then my foundation , when attempting to hide redness , so this color works well for that i follow everything up with dermablend finishing powder it stays on all day and provides great coverage it is a nice , creamy formula dermablend is a high quality company and so far i have been impressed with their products
5	i absolutely love this color for summer ! the pink has a tint of shimmer in it which looks amazing in the sunlight ! i received this product a day before the expected delivery date so i am very happy \)
4	nice vibrant color ! fun
3	it 's just ok i have n't noticed any difference after weeks of using it it has n't firmed my skin up , but it does seem better moisturized it 's a thin consistency and i'm used to a thicker cream it looks like it will last a long time , something welcome in an item this expensive after a while , it gets in my eyes and stings i cut back on how much i used , but it often finds it way into my eyes i 'll keep trying it for a few more weeks , but for me , this eye cream did n't work to decrease fine lines or improve any appearance in my eyes i 'll keep using it for a few more weeks and if anything positive changes , i 'll update this review
2	this was not as purple as it looks here if it were more cool toned gray i would have loved it too this color is best on darker skin tones it looked odd next to my fair skin
5	makes your hair feel like silk the smell is subtle , but very nice
5	ahava mud really works well on my extremely dry skin i apply hand lotion frequently throughout the day and almost always after washing my hands just a small squirt of mud is required to moisturize my dry skin it goes on smoothly and is completely absorbed very quickly without any greasy residue there is no discernible scent , and this is a very pleasant product to use
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
5	have been using it for years and i like the volume it gives my hair
5	thanks ! !
5	both my daughter \( 19 \) and i love this scent it is very light , not overwhelming as some fragrances are , flowery , sweet , spicy i'm not good at picking out exact scents , but this one is very pleasant one little squirt and you 're set for the entire day many perfumes give me a headache or make me sneeze , not this one the bottle is beautiful as well ! i would definitely recommend this , would make a lovely gift
2	this left my face really shiny , which i am not fond of it dissolved into my skin quickly and was definitely hydrating , but i did n't like the shine there are other obagi moisturizers that are matte , but this one is most definitely not shea butter , avocado , glycerine it 's too much for my normal to oily \( with some dry spots \) skin
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	i do have significant redness , and i do see some improvement when i have this on my face it 's not perfect , but i 'd have to wear enough makeup to frost a cake to get those kinds of result my aging skin is a bit dry , and it wants an application of another moisturizer prior to putting this on , or i get some flakiness but that 's me and i'm not the norm for a product like this same goes if i try to apply foundation over this , i'm getting that dry dry flakiness coming up i did notice some strong scent when i first put this on , but it seems to dissipate quickly , and i am one of those who are sensitive to scents and avoid them like the i also found this a lot light than wearing makeup , and it 's especially nice on the weekends \( as long as i remember to wash it off prior to bed \) the only deal breaker for me is the price point , but then again that 's me i'm a bit frugal
1	did n't not work at all did n't get warm at all ! do not buy save your money and buy a wand instead !
5	so i had finally bought some butter i avoided it because i just could n't get over the price however , i liked one of the colors very much and decided to give them a shot because their shape is a bit easier to store so , i bought a set kit thing and a 3 different colors one of the colors of the butters i did n't like that much against my skin , so , i decided because i loved the bottle so much \( this is awful do n't judge me \) i poured out the color \( i knew i would never use a color that did n't match my skin , and could n't find someone else who wanted it either \) and poured one of my opi 's into the empty butter bottle i noticed in this process of pouring out that the consistency of the butter london is much thicker than opi and even though the oz in the bottle is less than in the opi bottle it seemed to take forever to pour out i actually started to think the opi seemed cheap by how quickly it poured out which i have never thought before ! in the kit there was a cuticle oil , a clear top coat , a flesh color , and a nail polish remover the remover at first smells like any other remover but once that initial smell went away it made my hands smell like roses it was wonderful ! ! the cuticle oil smells very good as well and the top coat is awesome in case you have n't seen one in a store , the top black part actually pops off which i thought was kind of strange but i do n't mind it once the top pops off you have a lid to twist to open the bottle i think its just for design which i like because it makes for clean storage because of the solid rectangular shape i beat up my hands \( i'm an artist and a cook and i work sets sometimes \) so , my hands get beat up this nail polish really lasts i will say it does this weird thing where it in a way that does n't chip the polish which is great even though looks a little funny that took a long time to happen though i officially have been converted to butter london , however , they lack a lot of colors so , when they come out with more i will investigate i completely recommend this brand if you are able to spare the cost for the quality
5	this is an awesome , gentle toner i have very fair , sensitive aging skin \( 'm 53 \) and i have no trouble using this product daily i also use the other seaweed products by mb , and they are wonderful as well , especially the seaweed night cream
3	while it is medium coverage it does not seem to actually cover blemishes as i layered some of the red from my chin acne faded but did n't disappear it seems to cake in my pores and looked heavy it is easy to apply , start with finger application and blend with a sponge it is smooth , easy to blend , and feels good , not sticky while it does a good job , it does n't cover birthmarks , redness from acne , or tattoos but it does a good job at masking them just a bit so they are not i found that as the day went on touch ups were needed
5	i was so pleasantly surprised by this dermablend camo foundation the color match was great , the coverage was amazing and the sunscreen was a huge bonus i loved the flawless finish that this foundation gave me without feeling heavy it lasts for hours and needs minimal concealer for any scars i also have combination skin and have had no issues with acne with this foundation
4	this product gives me a nice color , and it smells better then most self tanners it seems to wash off before a week is up , so i apply it every 3 or 4 days i just used it for my legs and arms it is pretty expensive for what it is i usually use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href suave professionals visible glow self tanning body lotion fair to medium 7 5 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 suave professionals visible glow self tanning body lotion , fair to medium 7 5 oz a , and i love it ! the price is great , and the color lasts several days , if not a week it does n't rub off on clothes , like the xen tan does however , the suave has that self tanner stink so , the choice is yours !
4	this is a rich , creamy concealer that blends easily i have the natural shade i have fair to light skin tone and use this color as an under the eye concealer \( i go with a slightly darker shade if i am using it a quick fix for a blemish \) and then add a little powder to set it 's long lasting and wears well
5	i love this stuff ! my skin feels really moisturized after i put it on and it has a nice , gentle , clean smell the texture is very unique it almost feels like you are massaging water into your skin ! not at all greasy highly recommended
5	perfect color
5	i noticed an immediate difference in my skin after 1 use my skin felt , not tight , not oily , no breakouts the more i use it the better my skin gets i 've tried other products for sensitive skin , none of them worked not , dove , not cera , not cetaphil , nothing is as great as avene i will definitely order again i just love avene extremely gentle cleaner lotion , along with the thermal water , skin recovery , and not he gentle cleanser is also effective at removing all of my makeup including my 3 coats of mascara is the best stuff on earth i just love it
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
3	cleanser claims to be a 3 in 1 \( cleanses , tones , removes makeup \) out of all three products in this gift tin , i like the cleanser the least or i guess i should say , i do n't like the cleanser at all it does a lousy job cleaning the skin or removing make up i also do n't enjoy feeling like i'm washing my face with perfume for a product geared towards sensitive skin , what 's up with the excessive fragrance \? i like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href soft touch facial cleanser gel to milk formula natural organic anti aging for dry sensitive skin dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 soft touch facial cleanser , gel to milk formula , natural organic anti aging for dry sensitive skin a nbsp much better i find it works like a charm removing all makeup including eye makeup if i massage it into my face without water first , cleaning my entire face eyes , then rinsing off with warm water it smells very pleasant , gets my skin nice clean , is not irritating or drying night recovery gel balm is okay ish it dries slightly sticky is overly perfumed just like the cleanser i do n't want to smell my face all night long i do n't enjoy the tacky feel aside from that , my skin did n't react to it as for any anti aging effects , i 've noticed nothing seriously , i did n't expect to radiance boosting antioxidant serum this is my favorite product out of the three the only fault i have with it is the perfume fragrance vichy seems to love to make your face smell like you sprayed it with perfume ugh ! at least with this product , it seems to fade more quickly than the other two products it goes on easy has n't caused any irritation i wear it under my tinted spf moisturizer it is summer , so it 's been enough , but if this was winter , i 'd need another moisturizer on top of this before my tinted spf moisturizer regarding the anti aging claims , like the night treatment , i have n't noticed anything it has been several weeks using all three products well , almost i ran out of the perfumy cleanser pretty fast because it 's just a tiny little squeeze bottle anyway , i did n't expect results i did n't get them the packaging is nice suitable for gift giving if the person you are buying for likes perfumy facial products the recovery gel serum are in boxes that are then wrapped in tissue paper the bottles of these two products are glass which is nice as well the cleanser is in a plastic squeeze type bottle that is wrapped in tissue paper all three products are contained in the pretty vichy tin as pictured overall , this is okay it 's really not the best product for me but i have a few older female family members who do n't mind or maybe i should say are not as sensitive to all the fragrances like i am who would love to have something like this
3	i am a fan of several l'occitane products , but this is not my favorite two years ago i had extremely bad eczema \( from allergies \) surrounding my eyes i eliminated everything and used physician recommended remedies , but the eczema persisted until i used l'occitane immortelle eye cream , which cleared the eczema completely in less than 10 days i tell this story to show that there really seems to be healing power in the immortelle flower extract that makes up this portion of the company 's line at that time , and since then , i have tried many l'occitane products , with varying results i had tried this face cleanser in a small trial size and was somewhat underwhelmed it is weak as a makeup remover it is of removing the clinique eye makeup i wear daily \( not waterproof ! \) , so i always have to follow it with my usual face wash , which removes the mascara and eyeliner very easily and completely i would not use two products seems like a waste it never my sensitive skin , but never seemed to help either , and it leaves my facial skin very tight , which my usual cleanser does not i have placed this 5 ounce bottle in my shower , which seems more appropriate of a use to me , since i shower in the morning when my face is makeup free i will not be replacing this cleanser at this price , it should have some distinct advantages , which it does not not for me at least and one final comment on the smell that some are saying is chemical i think that you are smelling the immortelle flower extract , which l'occitane does not try to mask all the immortelle products have this smell , for obvious reasons
5	easy to go on and seems to be doing what it says it will do
5	love it
4	good standby for someone who is allergic to everything good under concealer
5	\( update 10 13 2017 \) been using this for a while now , and i am impressed even more than originally this stuff is great and the price is right too , compared to other lines i mentioned below i highly recommend this cream , again if you can tolerate the fragrance which i have gotten used to i have been using and exploring skin care for quite some time now , so i have had a chance to use many different brands at a wide variety of price points let 's see how vichy neovadiol compensating complex compares to the creams i have used what types of creams have i used some of the creams that i have used are as follows lancome absolue lancome multi action algenist firm and lift algenist genius loreal yes to blueberries l'occitane l'oreal clarins christian dior \( variety of them \) chanel shiseido the above list only reflects some of the brands i have had a chance to explore and test out keeping this in mind , i will compare this cream for effectiveness and what results it achieves what is this cream like \? vichy neovadiol compensating complex is indicated to be for mature skin that is post menopausal that means that the targets are for plumping skin , shrinking pores , radiance , making skin feel denser \( thus more youthful \) , contours , and more of an even tone to skin this cream does not have spf in it which i am thrilled about if you want to use spf , then you can put it on yourself the jar is glass another feature that i like it has a tight fitting cap with an inner seal which helps the cream from drying out the color is a beautiful iridescent peach color glass and the cream inside is an icy peachy pink color it is a bit thicker than the night version of this cream nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy neovadiol replenishing care night cream 1 69 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy neovadiol replenishing care night cream , 1 69 fl oz a how does this cream perform \? when applying this cream , it is extremely lightweight not at all thick and sticky like you might expect it goes on easily and absorbs very quickly into the skin the best way to put it on is to dot about a to pea sized dot on each of the face and then spread it into the skin there is a very heavy scent to this , which i have to be honest at first with the night cream made me want to , but i quickly got used to it many people would probably find it pleasant , but at first it was hard to get used to i have used this with the night cream at night so the combination of the action is to be considered i find that the cream leaves my skin very plump , glowy , moisturized for 12 hours until i use the night cream , and there is absolutely no sticky residue i find that it does seem to work best when i apply nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href 99 natural hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz 29 6 ml liquid dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 99 natural hyaluronic acid serum 1 fl oz \( 29 6 ml \) liquid a nbsp on before any moisturizer and after cleansing the skin i use this with all skin care as it improves performance greatly this skin care line will enable you to have a much better canvas to use makeup on for older women i do makeup on older women quite often and one of the biggest problems is not using really good skin care first this skin care \( along with the night cream \) will greatly improve the skin so that makeup application will be much nicer and less to look caked on i would say that this is an excellent skin care line for mature skin if you can tolerate the fragrance what i like about this cream excellent price for what you get glass jar a little goes a long way it is not sticky absorbs quickly differences begin quickly does what it promises what i don't like about this cream fragrance is a bit overbearing the bottom line i have to say compared to the other lines of skin care that i have tried over the years on myself and on others whose skin i work on , this line of neovadiol compensating complex is a serious for performance with good price range compared to high end i would put it in the same ball park as some of lancome , algenist , dior , , and i find it even better than some chanel , shiseido , clarins , and l'oreal \( although this company appears to have with l'oreal \) i really do not like the heavy scent , but i did get used to it it does not make my eyes water , and it fades away quick enough to be able to use it for the price vs performance , compared to other lines , i have to say this is a five star , although i am tempted to give it four stars due to the fragrance if you or someone you know has mature skin this would be a great cream to try out to improve makeup application and skin appearance
5	i was very happy to find this not only at such a reasonable price , but with the convenience of having it delivered to my home i first heard about this brand around a year ago at my cosmetic dermatologist 's office and tried it because it was offered at 20 off i ca n't remember how much it cost , but i know it was over 100 and it does work as promised for many years , i was hooked on buying my skincare from home shopping and i know i 've spent much more than 62 00 on any one of the , peter thomas roth , dr products , etc that i literally threw money away on , and except for the temporary anti wrinkle serums , nothing ever came close to achieving the results that skincare products provide i use nia intensive recovery on my face , neck , chest and the back of my hands every night for the daytime i have recently started using therapy \( 85 00 for a 1 oz bottle , but if you order directly from their website , you receive samples plus i also received a gift with purchase , a full size 34 00 tube of feet foot lotion in addition to free shipping \) i first tried both of these products as sample trial sizes that i purchased from ebay \( for around 15 00 each for a month 's supply \) so i was able to determine how my skin would react before investing in the full sizes and i also have a home microdermabrasion tool \( pmd \) that i use weekly , to help the products to penetrate nia intensive is very rich so a little goes a long way and it really is n't that expensive in comparison to so many of the skincare products available
4	i ordered this since i love other products by this brand i did n't realize it was just spring water but it was i admit i about died laughing when i saw that however , oddly enough , it does wonders for the skin it 's like a very light moisturizer it sprays on super fine , very refreshing after my shower , and i let it air dry \( why would you pat it off like they suggest \? ! \) i come out with very soft , fresh feeling skin that is lightly moisturized now i have very dry skin and usually use shea butter , but i can get away with using this when i have less time to get ready i just work on my makeup and teeth brushing and the like while it dries so yes , i went from complete skeptic to fan my only reason i took off a star is that it is quite expensive for , well , water although i like it , it 's really outrageous to be honest i would look for something similar with a different brand
1	this extremely expensive alpha hydroxy cream is marketed as a skin brightener and , in that sense , i guess it kind of worked since my skin was bright after a single use bright red that is after only an hour or so of wear all indoors , so no sun exposure i began to have a terrible blotchy red reaction , and i do n't have extremely sensitive skin \( have only ever had one slightly bad reaction before , to a roc cream \) washed my face multiple times and applied extra moisturizer , cold cream and , eventually , dots of cream to calm the blotches it was n't painful , but it looked terrible and scary and i cant imagine what would have happened had i gone in sunlight , as this product specifically and warns against , or used it twice daily , as the directions instruct yikes never again
5	great product for dry or normal skin anti aging pleasant feel luxurious \)
5	this is a wonderful brush it blends and feels good in your hand the handle has a smooth rubbery feel and the brush is said to be natural it feels and smells like rabbit hair it is what its package says the beauty of the kabuki theatre with the superb craftsmanship of professional makeup tools i have used this for cake blush and powder as well as loose it works well for both of them it blends perfectly for each , but is too big for eyeshadow application this brands brushes are my favorite when i need makeup brushes i would get no other brand
5	long wearing and easy to apply formula love the essie line was not able to find in the local store fast shipping and brand new bottle
4	at first i could n't understand why a bottle of lotion would be almost 50 but then i realized that this is a perfume based lotion to layer the josie scent so let 's talk about the lotion first it is about average , sinks in , is n't too greasy and is good for moderate moisturizing onto the scent it is strong but settles a little after awhile it is a little musky with a hint of flowers i tend to prefer a more and scent but i have enjoyed the whiffs i get of this throughout the day if you like layering your scent and you like the josie perfume , this will add to your experience
2	the pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails , no matter how many coats you put on i mixed it with a white polish , which helped , but you should n't have to do that do n't expect a solid color
4	the body wash washes off quite easily unlike many other body washes that make you use a ton of water before your skin actually feels clean and clear of soap i like the smell and it does a good job cleaning my body it 's strong enough to cut oil off your skin but gentle enough for i have pretty sensitive skin \( i suffer from psoriasis \) but so far i have n't had any issues using this product overall a great product
5	it made my father 's hair look great , too bad it ca n't stay there forever
5	this rosewater spray is conveniently packaged , and is really charming and refreshing it helps tone and moisturize the face , and it also helps me feel refreshed after a day before for the night it simply feels pleasant , aromatic \( not too much overly , just the right for me \) , relaxing i did not use cotton ball , but just directly sprayed a bit and massaged onto face and neck rosewater has been suggested as a beauty remedy in asian countries since old times , and no wonder , it does work i did not feel any itch or rashes or stickiness due to this rosewater , and it has a reasonable price
3	for those that have enjoyed this brand in the past , you are likely to be disappointed this is still beautifully presented in an attractive bottle and is of a very ample size but that is where the ends this is overbearing especially for a eau de none of the or undertones this you with a force that will not be ignored in short , this is just another pretty face , superficial and rather
4	it straightens and protects your hair , and smells amazing i used to love this product until i realized that it does n't do anything spectacular aside from that the problem is there are much better products out there and are two better brands that come to mind still , a good straightening serum
5	i had a huge allergic to something and my face it was horrible crusty , raw skin , red swollen eyes i had to stop using my lancome , elizabeth arden , and estee lauder products \( had a pile to work through \) because their fragrance was my skin more i even to using cerave and cetaphil creams as that normally works , and my skin just felt like the moisture was n't penetrating my skin the skin under my eyes was so dry that makeup made me look like a sun 100 year old woman the bioderma cream \( and other bioderma products that came through vine \) were a lifesaver ! this cream moisturizes better than the lancome hydra zen \( cost 2x as much \) and no fragrance to irritate my skin i wo n't be reordering the lancome i love this cream and think it 's on subscribe and save , it is a forever
3	i 've had good results with this product line however , this serum is not working for me yet i like the unscented serum i applied a few drops on my face where saggy jowls are starting to appear this product is supposed to give back bounce for your skin i 've been trying it off and on , i ca n't tell any difference i 'll update if there are any changes in my results
2	this product does n't work order form pca directly
4	this is a very nice assortment of colors , goes on smooth and easy , and lasts all day throughout my work day no irritation to report , so all around good set for the price
2	i am a huge fan of the r co park blow out balm but this just missed the mark for me it smells delicious as all r co products do , and it 's a neat idea but once it was in my hair it had way too much texture i received this as a sample in my latest birchbox and when i first tried it out i used the smallest amount seriously , at the rate i foresee myself using this product it 'll be at least 6 months before i run out of the tiny little sample size it did n't feel terribly gritty when i first applied it but after a few minutes it was like i had my roots with a bottle of 1980 's strength hairspray i waited a few hours to see if that dissipated but it did n't and my day 2 hair looked pretty gross and greasy which for me , on day 2 , is unusual maybe my very thick , curly hair just responds better to a finer dry shampoo but either way this just did n't do it for me if you 're looking for loads of texture though this could definitely be for you !
5	this stuff is amazing i have thinning spots and this covers and binds to the hair i used to always have to wear my hair up to cover it but i can wear my hair down now and not have to worry about my patches showing it stays in place and does n't wear off throughout the day no more worries i 've been contemplating buying this stuff for awhile after reading someone 's blog about thinning hair i buy the smallest size of these , use it everyday \( a little goes a long way \) and it lasts me a month i just reorder when i get low so buy size accordingly to how much you need get it you wo n't be disappointed get your confidence back !
5	this toner makes your face feel fresh clean does n't burn like most toners but still works the same
4	it 's been difficult for me to find brown eyebrow pencils that do n't have warm reddish tones this one is a true brown and does n't pull any of those unwanted tones when i use it it goes on smoothly this is not one of those pencils that is n't pigmented or that requires a lot of pressure in order to get the product where you need it as for the brown color itself , i 'd say this particular one is a medium brown it 's definitely too dark to be considered light , but it 's not so deep and dark that it looks entirely unnatural on someone with my very pale complexion and blonde hair the spoolie on the end of the pencil is great because this product is one that does need to be combed through once it 's applied or else it does into unnatural looking territory the brush spreads the product just enough that it looks more natural and flattering there are just a few downsides to this for me this is just a personal preference , but having to \( eventually \) use a sharpener on this is not ideal i do prefer the automatically sharpened eyebrow pencils that you can advance by twisting the bottom also , this is is n't easy to remove even after i went over it with a cleansing cloth and then a makeup remover and then an actual cleanser , there was still some pigment left behind finally , while it is a good product , the price point is on the high side other than those things , though , i do think this is a good eyebrow pencil , and i would recommend it
4	this product is old school masculine first , it does the job the soap does a great job of cleaning and for a small bar does n't dissolve quickly the scent is a cross between old time and my grandfather 's pipe i love it interesting side note i bought this soap in december after i bought it amazon said the soap would be delivered to me around jan 20th to my shock it came on exactly jan 20th ! i also found out why it shipped from europe
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	nothing special don t notice any improvement or change but less expensive than most other eye creams and hyaluronic acid is an excellent skin plumper
3	the julep blush in petal pink color is a true pink with no overpowering tones , and easy to apply with one stroke of the brush the price is on the higher side , and no brush is included however the product is good quality , does n't itch or irritate the skin it kind of wears off around 6 8 hours which is ok the color i photo looks more hot pink than it is massaging the color in a bit with the hand made it more even , that 's just a personal preference the price point and lack of brush is preventing me giving it 4 stars
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
3	i'm relatively familiar with mario badescu products , i last used them about 11 years ago i was eager to try this lotion , and for the most part , i do really like it i love the way it feels , i think it really helps with dryness and the scaly , chapped feeling skin on my elbows what i am not fond of is the of the packaging the plastic coating of the label came off immediately and the smell it has kind of an old lady smell to it , not so much the fresh and clean that the description boasts however , i can deal with the smell for the way it feels on the skin
5	such a lovely lightweight lotion ! it is just what i wanted and i love the light scent i have oily skin and this works so well to give me moisture but not too much
5	great product for my aging skin ! works on my neck too ! love it
5	this full coverage foundation stick is amazing it could be used as regular foundation , but i have been using it as a concealer i occasionally have a break out on my upper chest area i do n't typically put makeup on my chest , but when i have a pimple there it becomes really inflamed and noticeable it remains like this all while it heals too i just want my chest to look all the same color so , i have been using this stick to cover up the two red \( currently , previously pimples \) there it is so easy and it does a fantastic job ! all you have to do is rub the stick across the area i personally like to blend it more , so i use a beauty blender to blend it in another great thing about this stick is that it is build able you could easily add another layer if you need darker coverage it makes my pimples disappear and blend with my skin it also does not irritate them or make them worse , which is a huge plus i highly recommend this foundation stick
5	good product
5	this is so so pretty i do n't tend to like purples on my nails , however this makes me change my mind gorgeous color and the is great !
4	love essie but i am not thrilled about this color but too each his own
5	i love this nail polish it is the only brand i will use they have so many different colors , the finish is perfect , and they do n't chip as much as the other brands i still use a protective top coat just in case i also rely on this brand because it is free of all the big three chemicals this color specifically , , is a shiny black finish it takes about 2 3 coats to get it covered but it lasts about a week without a top coat i plan on buying more colors in the future
5	this foundation base applies beautifully and can easily provide fuller coverage if desired i like it because i do n't look made up after applying it highly recommend ! !
4	first let 's look at the trinity device itself and then we 'll get into the eye and lip enhancer attachment the nuface trinity makes a big promise use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging does it work \? yes is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented \? no read on process after washing your face , you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target because the gel dries very fast i break up my face into three treatment areas forehead brows , left side of face , right side of face following the of the device , you glide the nuface over the area three times there are many techniques you can use to do this for example , your cheek side of face is divided into three sections along the jaw , in the hollows of your cheeks , and on your cheek bone you glide over each area three times , slowly , in to the beep of the device you can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle this is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows when you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash cloth you can then apply moisturizer and either makeup \( if using in am \) or night creams \( if using in pm \) results you will see results instantly i notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows the 'elevens' between my eyes let me explain the effect is two fold the lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens' there is also a slight effect in that you can smile and the lines do n't come back very neat i hate my down turned brows i have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles the nuface creates the same result i get when holding my brows up my brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position this makes me look more awake and less grumpy definitely a plus ! drawbacks the biggest drawback is that the results are temporary after about 6 hours your face is back to normal therefore if you want the results , you 'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback time is a big issue for a full treatment with optimal results , you need about 20 30 minutes i find if i do a the results are n't near as noticeable and fade quickly if you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face , you 'll have no issues for those of us who need every minute of every day for work life it gets old even though the results are great it 's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous i actually first heard about the product in an elle magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed i hate how the gel primer feels it 's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly i just do not like the sensation then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth ele \( eye and lip enhancer \) attachment i should state that i do not have smoker 's lines on my lips and i do not yet have crow 's feet perhaps if i had these types of lines i would have gotten more out of the ele that said , i do have awful tear trough lines and smile lines i honestly did not notice a big difference when using the ele attachment to target these areas and using the regular nuface i experienced the same amount of lift and plump without having to switch out the device heads some of the youtube tutorials i watched recommended using the ele to really target your brows and i have to say i get much better lift using the original device on my brows than the ele ! based on my experience , you really do n't need the ele unless perhaps you have smoker 's lines or crow 's feet
5	i am typically lazy when it comes to removing my make up and i prefer pre moistened cloths i have tried other vichy products in the past and loved them , so i figured that i would give this a try anyhow my eyes are normally irritated after removing my eye makeup \( which consists of mascara , eyeshadow primer , eyeshadow in different layered colors and eyeliner \) i applied the vichy to a cotton pad and removed my eye makeup after a long day of class the eye makeup came off pretty easily it did leave my eyes feeling soft \( but not gross like some makeup remover \) and did n't irritate them i even used some of this formula along my lower lash line trying to really get my eyes clean i do n't know that it necessarily soothed my eyes however , it did n't irritate them that is a plus for me i also really like the scent it is refreshing and not over the top the only downside for me is the price i can buy many other makeup removers that work for much less than the current price of 17 a bottle i will enjoy using this makeup remover while it lasts \( which will actually be awhile \) i wo n't be buying it at it 's current price if you really need a non irritating makeup remover and do n't mind spending 17 , then i would recommend it
5	this concealer is incredibly lightweight and does not settle in creases or lines the coverage is much better than expected it covers well even without a primer the color was a very good match for my skin it wears well it lasted i have very sensitive skin , and i had no problem with this product
3	for the price i thought it worked ok if it were 20 bucks or so , i 'd say awesome but overall i would have expected more from this product because of it 's price but it 's not a bad product
4	i have never tried any laura biagiotti products before but am happy with this it has a strong smell when coming out of the bottle but after showering it is more subtle it is hard to describe the scent it has a bit of a sweet smell by a more masculine smell i use this when i go out on a date or out with friends this is comes in a classy looking bottle i can smell the fragrance even with the bottle closed the smell is strong when coming out of the bottle but becomes more subtle after a shower it does have a sweet smell but that is by a more masculine smell when i am using a shower gel , deodorant , or cologne i want something that smells nice but does not smell like a perfume this is a nice smelling shower gel that is made for a man it is not something i would wear to work but is perfect when i am going out on a date or going out with friends
3	very heavy i will thin with c serum i do n't have acne but this could clog pores no doubt woke with slight puffy eye due to thickness of cream i could n't wipe it off so used toner to remove some so i wouldnt wake up with zits ! i just tapped some on so be aware !
4	ok if you 're super about your skin listen up firstly im half black and half white and my skin is pretty oily i hyper pigment because i pick at any imperfection i have i had this brown spot on my left cheek right under my eye that me crazy my esthetician used this on me once a month to clear up my brown spots and over the course of a year it totally fixed my skin then i got i ordered some for myself to get rid of the brown spot on my cheek day 1 applied it using a brush morning and night felt a slight sting both times and area turned red i put the gel on after i toned and moisturized my skin day 2 applied morning at night again stung a bit more and turned red again kept my daily skin routine day 3 spot was dark red when i woke up and slightly sensitive applied morning at night stung again still cleansed and moisturized my face \( you put the gel on after all of that \) day 4 woke up to a nasty dark scab on my check kinda of but continued to use it twice a day it burned day 5 woke up convinced i was scarred for life the patch was dry and dark and very hard to cover with make up i applied it once more at night and only left it on for twenty minutes day 6 no more using the gel kept my same routine and put vitamin e oil on it twice a day it was so dark and i ended up calling a dermatologist convinced i made it worst day 7 more e and cover up no using gel almost cried looking in the mirror day 8 dark patch super dry looked closely in the mirror and realized it was starting to flake applied more vitamin e day 9 the scab came off and the spot was 80 lighter omg the heavens opened up and i was still applying vitamin e though so thankful listen to your skin and be careful
5	great seller , received on time great color , last 2 weeks
4	overall , i really like this lip pencil i had never used a lip pencil before , and as someone who likes to go with makeup , i really prefer the look and feel of the pencil it just seems neater and more distinct i like the colors more than i thought i would the pencil goes on easily , and is easy to blend i love having the 2 colors i had fun applying it with a young friend the pencil is easy to sharpen , and does n't crumble , break , etc when sharpened my one reservation about this product is that when my lips were slightly chapped from windy conditions , the pencil seemed to irritate them when my lips healed , this was no longer a problem recommended , though others want to go easy on this product when lips are unhappy
5	excellent sunscreen feels good on my sensitive face
4	those who enjoy contouring \( especially for evening , since it is most effective in evening light \) should find this high quality palette to be useful it is relatively expensive , and the amounts provided are small , but they are adequate for the presumably small number of occasions for which they would be used \( contouring in three blends is not a daytime staple \) the products are gentle on the skin , blend well , and are an excellent combination for the highlighting and shading one would desire
5	great color for french manicure
3	i used a lot of opi products and i do like the convenience of the combination of top and bottom coat in one jar there is no denying that the products are high quality and do their job well great formula the brush is excellent it fans out to deposit the polish as designed i have a problem that opi is n't a cruelty free company , and that is hard for me to support due to personal reasons
5	this foot cream worked so well i could not believe it at all it was not greasy , nor chalky rather , it was smooth and very soothing i was surprised that it had little discernible odor it simply went on smooth , soothed , and was a pleasure to deal with it helped my feet become happy feet
5	i thought i ordered the regular spf 46 i 've been using for many years , but i received the tinted spf , which i 'd never tried it turned out to be a lucky mistake , because i like the tinted even more it does n't add color it takes away the white sheen the regular spf is white on my face for a couple of minutes before it sinks in , and i always felt like i had to use makeup over it so i did n't look too pale the tinted just blends into my skin , and i do n't need anything over it if i do n't want to wear makeup great great stuff
4	picture shows red in it there is no red and it is much lighter than picture will have to mix with med blonde
5	this is a super high quality make up brush ! i love trying new make up products and this brush works wonderfully at applying face powder it picks it up well without depositing a ton of it in one spot on your face and blends the powder well it is nice and fluffy and feels soft against the skin i highly recommends this brush !
5	another beautiful color , i am loving this
5	this color is so lovely ! the product only requires one coat and it lasts for 7 days
4	this facial cleanser \( has a toner like consistency , use on a cotton round \) has no scent that i can detect if there is fragrance it is so light as to be undetectable by me it is pleasant on the skin and leaves my face clean and soft while it did take my foundation makeup off , it was less than successful with my eye makeup i needed to use an oil based product to get my mascara off while i could use something more robust for summer , this is perfect for the winter skin care season it is not drying and cleans without harshness easy to use , leak resistant container
5	great consistency i love essie beautiful color too !
5	long lasting and not oily as usual smells wonderful i loooove this brand , as it was not oily or left with any residual feel only a little goes a long way i use this for both my hands and face ,
3	polish seemed old dried a much darker color dissappointed
3	i received this through the amazon vine program so did n't pay for it myself when i found out the price , i was shocked i was expecting it to cost less than half as much ! that said , it 's a nice long lasting \( 100 hours \) candle that to me smells a spicier vanilla i do n't generally burn candles in my home because i believe they can leave on your and over time , i like led candles these days , which give off the same light and seem a lot safer that said , i will use this candle for special occasions , it does leave my pad smelling nice and not too fruity
4	i love mustela products and have been using them for the past 1 year the quality , fragrance , to my kid 's skin is all great what i do not approve of is the quality i need to use to get the desired effect the cream is a bit more liquidy , the bubble bath needs to be used a lot more to get a decent amount of bubbles and that makes the product expensive for me
5	sent on time and works as advertised
3	for covering discoloration this stick is ok i found it to give the look of a heavier pancake style makeup having had an injection that left a black and blue mark on my chin i used the corrective stick to cover it with only fair success after applying i used my finger to blend the product and then a brush to even out the cover up my friend noticed the discoloration so obviously it was not a good cover up for a black and blue when applied under my eyes it was difficult to blend and settled into wrinkles
5	just what i ordered , quick delivery must have for the shellac to last the two weeks no bad smell , easy to use
5	this curling iron curls my hair perfectly ! it heats up fast , gets real hot and creates perfect waves or perfect \( depending on if i curl the hair or wrap it with the tool upside down \) i totally recommend it !
5	i'm on my 3rd bottle because it hydrates my skin and makes it glow , and seems like it promotes healing as well i'm an esthetician and i use all kinds of products and rarely re purchase anything because i'm always trying something new so for me to be on my 3rd bottle of something says a lot combined with peels , retinoids , vitamin c , and sunscreen , this stuff is anti aging gold
5	this is an elegant gel under eye moisturizer no fragrance light weight and non greasy absorbs quickly main ingredient appears to be glycerin nice for day time because it absorbs fast and you can right away apply under eye make up if you have really , really dry under eye area , you may need something heavier and thicker
5	excellent product with no acetone removes gel nail polish perfectly highly recommend it
2	in the past , i have used juice beauty 's moisturizer and was so pleased with it i thought ordering this acne set for my teenager would be a no brainer boy , was i wrong ! first , i must address the odor issue the face wash and acne clearing serum smelled absolutely rancid when we first opened the acne clearing serum tube , the content came squirting and losing out the serum was very liquidy , like water with smelly brown grains it looked like water and smelled like pond i immediately checked the date on the box , but we were n't near expiration i do n't think the serum should have had the consistency our tube had my son decided to try it despite it being and having an odd consistency unfortunately , after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better he decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage i ca n't blame him despite it being and having an odd consistency unfortunately , after two weeks of using it his skin is dry it out and his acne looks no better he decided to stop using it and pitch in the garbage i ca n't blame him i would not recommend the acne kit frankly , buying good old noxzema , , or neutrogena is the better way to go
5	unbelievable ! this stuff works wonders and does exactly what it said it will do ! my hair looks just like i came out from a long swim in the however ! it is soft ! and omg it smells so good ! i highly recommend this for the look and lets face it , the less we have to use heat on our hair the better is it ! i just wash , spray , scrunch and go ! it looks great and i 've gotten several compliments on my hair !
5	loved this product ! easy application and looks great good coverage use daily on face
3	i bought this at ulta on a whim and i am less than impressed it 's the most expensive polish i 've bought by far and i was expecting something close to miraculous what i got was the opposite the formula is difficult to work with , uneven and dry and even after three coats i can still see visible nail it took a little longer to dry than the others i usually use this color is fairly pretty but nothing noteworthy \( while i was shopping earlier i saw a very similar essie and i wish i would have saved my money and bought it instead ! \) despite all of this , the polish wears really well it does n't rub off my nail tips like the others it 's tough ! its durability brought my rating up from two stars to three but that does n't make it worth 14 i 'll just stick with my 6 china glaze
5	i was surprised this was not greasy at all and soaked in really well going to buy the full size !
5	wonderful color for summer plus it is long lasting and has n't chipped in almost two weeks of wear even though it 's called weekly polish !
3	the good part about this handcream is it is light and you can do whatever you want after applying it the bad news is it 's expensive for the amount you get and the scent is overpowering the scent reminded me of strong and was too strong for me needless to say , if you love you may love this non greasy shea butter cream it 's hard to find shea butter products that do n't leave you feeling greasy so you may enjoy this it would also make a lovely gift for someone who likes heavily products
5	love this color
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i love this product ! i use it so i do n't have to dye my hair every month to keep it red , and it definitely works i feel like i just dyed my hair every time i use it the reason i say to use cautiously is because it will make your hair fall out if you leave it in longer than 5 minutes i made that mistake once wanting a deeper color tone and had a handful of hair fall out \( but nothing too serious ! do n't let that deter you from buying this great product \) i mix about a handful with a deep conditioner and my hair feels smooth , shiny , and has extra color that makes everyone ask me if i'm a natural redhead buy this if you 're looking to get that natural redhead look !
2	this lip gloss is light and non sticky , but the color \( which is supposed to be very light , or so i thought \) easily and makes my mouth look like i have chapped lips i am over 50 , so maybe this is a gloss that would work on a younger person 's lips , but for me it does n't do anything i 've tried using it for two days and have not noticed any improvement to the softness of my lips or anything that makes me want to use it regularly the price is awfully high for a gloss that does not plump the lips or make any improvement in looks
5	this item is a little pricey but well worth it i purchased it about 12 months ago , and after using it once a week every week , there is at least half a bottle of product left i use with china glaze , opi , orly and butter london polishes every manicure is a success , long lasting and smooth coverage wait about 10 minutes between applications of base coat \( butter london \) , 2 applications of nail polish , then top coat wonderful results !
1	my husband actually laughed when he used this gel he could n't figure out what it was for , since it apparently did n't do a thing his hair after application was like he had just washed it with baby shampoo super soft and with zero control if you are looking for a hair gel , keep looking this is n't worth the tube it 's packaged in
5	perfect pink ! this nail polish also does n't seem to dry out as fast as others
5	ok , i am from and you know how we feel about big hair i just love the smell of this stuff like a freshly baked sugar plus it is very rich and thick , and not as drying as other mousse products tend to be leaves the hair soft with a little bit more volume i am now on my 2nd one !
5	good
4	this is an awesome creme foundation my favorite so far ! it is a little darker than i anticipated , but that worked out well for me you do n't need to use much to get good coverage , this way it also does n't look caked on very natural look i wear this all day long without reapplying too love that this covers up all my blemishes ! !
4	i have never tried any type of device like this on my skin before i am older and have avoided wrinkles but i do have issues that came with menopause i felt like my face became a mine field of irregular rough patches and age spots bought this , the basic model , to try it out i 've been quite pleased my skin looks smoother and more even with just a few uses once i am st the improvement far less noticeable rough or flaky skin age spots look less bumpy had a difficult time using this around my nose \( the vibration made me sneeze \) and this model only gas a single speed do i ca n't low it down i also felt for the price the charge cord should come with a plug overall i am very pleased with the results i look and feel like i had a facial i have sensitive skin but this device has been gentle and non irritating like it more than i anticipated
5	dermablend 's smooth liquid camo medium to high coverage foundation makeup is great for sunscreen protection which lasts all day you may need to set it with dermablend 's powder after you apply it dermablend is as reliable as it has always been for masking scars , tattoos or things that only bother you when you want to look your best having it in liquid foundation form is very nice you can go to the beach wearing this as a sunscreen and look , ! \)
5	nice good quality
5	others have so i wo n't repeat the obvious however , having spent lots of money trying every brand at just about every cost , this is simply the best currently available i was using jb beard lube got this in a jb gift set wow , what a difference beard lube is now relegated for personal grooming i prefer the smaller tube of this jb sells as its easier to dispense a small amount a little goes a long , long way i'm talking you only need a dab rubbed between hands to cover your whole face with a rich , smooth layer of shaving goodness highly recommended !
5	this is now my go to product i especially like the little brush which allows to dab the product under my eye in little spots and then blend it with my fingertip it blends well with my fair skin tone i also deal with rosacea which tends to break out with certain cosmetics needless to say i was pleased that this corrective concealer pen did not cause any outbreaks i can truly say that this product works for me i have just overcome a bout of and if you can recall the dark circles that come from battling an , then you know how rough the appearance of your eyes look after such a bout this corrective concealer pen completely eliminated the appearance of those dark circles i am very pleased with this product the only drawback i could find is that the concealer pen is opaque and therefore you do n't know whether or not you are almost out of concealer as a result , i will probably have to purchase a backup pen just in case
5	i have had mild breakouts off and on my entire adult life \( i am now 41 and still get them ! \) i have tried every single skin care product on the market no and always go back to skyn because it is very worth the price excellent quality and skin within a month of using i pray skyn does n't go out of business ! !
2	this curling iron works so so i am not convinced , even though i love the babyliss straightener it leaves your hair smelling burnt \( my hair is extremely thick so i needed to set it on the hottest setting otherwise it wo n't curl for me \) if you have thin hair this might not be the case , but if you have thick hair and are looking to buy this , i would go with a different iron the actual curling part of the curling iron is a good size for long hair i have long hair and i do n't have to i added images
4	this concealer is very creamy and has good coverage between this and the foundation , i would recommend getting the foundation which has equally good coverage but a lighter texture , and you 'll get a lot more product for the money and a more versatile product
5	excellent
5	i have hyper pigmentation and this foundation covered it quite well while not being overly heavy you have to go online and find your shade , and see in the company 's website is pretty similar to the actual color this foundation has a cool based hue that is flattering and not ashy not too light i have fair to olive skin and this color was perfect for me i put it in the morning and it lasted throughout my workday which was good , but you should reapply for better coverage over extended periods of time the foundation feels great , its blendable , breathable , and buildable you can adjust coverage by applying a bit more for more coverage
5	my doctor recommended this to me and it works well also the price is pretty good compared to other over the counter moisturizers
4	has floral scents with a dash of nutmeg and spice of course , the smell varies for everyone but i found it a little too overpowering for my tastes you do get quite a bit of the liquid , and i 've taken a photo next to a can of soda for comparison purposes overall , not bad for the price
5	i always thought that i needed a cleanser that was more astringent for my combo skin this gentle cleanser makes my skin feel smooth and silky no break outs or oily patches redness is gone in only a month
5	i use this on my skin when i start to get flakes or when i have a burn as opposed to daily use it feels nice and absorbs well on the skin without feeling too greasy
4	love this stuff ! ! wish i would have found this year 's ago it would have saved me tons of money ! ! !
4	i have dry skin and am constantly trying to find moisturizers that will not clog my pores and keep me hydrated i like the scent of this oil and so far it does not appear to clog my skin but sometimes i find it a little heavy it could be because it is still summer and not the winter when i feel especially dry that i found myself using this sparingly or not at all i think this facial oil is probably too heavy if you have oily skin or if the weather is hot and humid it is probably a great protector if you live in an arid environment or if it is winter it does seem to smooth the skin out but because it is an oil you may want to let it absorb a bit \( or not using it \) before applying top layers of makeup as they may come off i think this facial oil is best during dry times and for use at night before bed
4	works great , leaves hair shiny and smooth do not use the hottest setting , however , as i burned off half of my hair
5	i bought this for my sister who loves nail polish it arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color she gets compliments on it all the time , and like other essie polishes , it does n't chip easily
1	maybe i just got a bad or old batch , but this smelled sour when i received it returned !
5	awesome for removing eye makeup i do n't use waterproof stuff so i do n't know how it works for that , but for regular mascara and liner , it dissolves it like , without any greasy residue or irritation i use it as toner sometimes , too , just to wipe away anything my cleanser might have left behind , or any residue from the cleanser
4	number 1 , i do not like to spend a lot of time on my hair i got things to do , places to see , and so i needed a curling iron that did what i needed it to do make me look pretty in 4 minutes or less this does it ! ! ! it heats up fast and it is just the right diameter to do what i need curl my bangs i was glad i read the reviews about how hot it gets because , yup , this machine does get hot so i only put it to a medium heat level i love the easy way the bar flips up and down so i can i easily lay it on the counter while i brush my hair the only problem is it does not automatically shut off otherwise i would have given it 5 stars
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	this product is and above it 's other price range curling irons it gets very hot relatively quickly and is pretty easy to use unfortunately you do get what you pay for \( and i was ripped off paying 45 at the beauty store for it \) after about 2 days of use , there was a short in the rotating cord and if the iron is held at an odd angle , it turned off it was still usable , but i had to the way i curled my hair to avoid it turning off and losing heat after about 6 months , you can see the ceramic coating chipping off a little and i used the iron about 3 4x per month if you 're in the market for a cheap curling iron i would suggest this because compared to the revlon , remington and conair brands i 've had in the past , this is the closest to a high end curling iron among them most likely you will have better luck with your iron than i did
5	this curling iron is fabulous ! ! i 've always bought conair curling irons over the years and just about every 2 years i end up having to buy a new one for different reasons well since i 've been using this hot tools curling iron , it 's the best ! it heats up very fast and the heat is evenly distributed through the barrel plus , it came with 2 extra metal pieces for the underside of the barrel that allows the iron to open ! and in my experience before , when that piece breaks , you have to buy a whole new curling iron so that was an added bonus i did n't expect ! overall so far a ! !
4	this product has many of the in ingredients for the skin and at least some are not just in , but also proven effective it was kind of a surprise when i took the top off to find out that it is a pump container liked this over the usual jar when i got some of the product out , i noticed it smelled a little like grapes juice maybe it does have some grape derived ingredient i think in any case , it was a refreshing kind of scent a bit heavier than what i 'd prefer , but not over the top it went on an into my skin easily and made it look and feel a lot smoother than it had been stayed that way a while the current amazon price is 65 for 1 7 oz that is a lot of money , but if the product works very well , it may be worth it will have to try this out longer term and report back i 'll give it four stars for now subject to upgrade later
5	i do n't know what the double glow means other than that it feels great and gives you an immediate \( single \? \) glow my skin felt refreshed and my skin tone looked more even right off the bat apparently with continued use it is supposed to improve my skin even more maybe that 's the double part i do have sensitive skin and this did not bother it or sting \( unlike bliss a peel that me \) masks are all the rage now i have really good skin in most areas but i do have some hyperpigmentation on my cheekbones i intend in the future to make this last by only using it on my cheekbones
4	i love this stuff , however they trick you by putting it into a canister with a raised bottom so it appears there is alot more in there than reality do n't be tricky !
5	honestly , my only complaint is that i did n't order these a long time ago ! i had been using the sensitive , which were alright i have sensitive skin at times so i was reluctant to purchase these i have been doing chemical peels for a few months and they have helped some i'm 32 , with combo skin and scars from picking i just used these for the first time and wow ! i can already see a difference i'm quite the skin care junkie so i only write rave reviews when something really legit works i do n't think these will cause any irritation if anything , these may cause less damage than the sensitive version because i am not going over the same spot repeatedly i 'll buy again !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	as one other reviewer said , nothing wrinkles and to be honest , i do n't have a lot of wrinkles to start with , so i wo n't comment at all about this product 's effectiveness on wrinkles but , my skin gets dry at times , and i'm not getting any younger so the scent is really nice i was neither crazy about it nor hated it when i first tried this , but as i 've been using it the scent has grown on me to the point i can say i genuinely like it it goes on smoothly i rub it between my palms and then gently spread it over my face and neck \( except on my nose and to either side , where i tend to have oily skin \) i found it goes on and absorbs better that way than using my fingertips it makes my skin feel soft , and not greasy love that it 's made from organic ingredients i 've been using it morning and night i have a feeling that would be too often for me if i were using this during the summer here in florida , but it 's been cooler and dryer lately , so twice a day has been just right what i intended to say in this review is that i 'd never actually pay the price for this product \( i received it free as a vine reviewer \) , but now that i 've been using it , i'm not sure i can say that anymore i 've tried several less expensive products \( some organic , some not \) and always given up on them within a week for various reasons i 've found nothing to complain about with this so far , though , and could see myself wanting to continue with it when this far is empty however , i still feel the price is rather steep , so i ca n't really give it five stars it 's not miracle working , just a very nice moisturizer , so for 45 for this little 2 ounce jar i ca n't justify a five star rating if i change my mind about that when i 've finished this jar , i 'll update my review
5	this cleanser does not soap up , is for sensitive skin prone to redness and has a very light scent i use it almost every nite to cleanse my skin and remove make up and my skin looks great and feels great
5	great for your hair does not weigh it down and smells great
5	i love it ! very easy to apply ! quick dry !
4	so far so good
5	feels great
5	my favorite spring and summer coral !
5	this comes packaged in a little brown box the labels on the box are all to match the product it says it is made in the us the bottle itself is a spray bottle the perfume sprays pretty evenly and finely the smell is a little more masculine , especially when first sprayed , but i could see a man or woman wearing it the scent is sweet with the tobacco scent prominent not like a smoke scent , rather the scent of tobacco before you smoke it it also has a smell to it that makes it almost addictive to sniff it settles in nicely and is n't too overpowering in any way it is n't strongly musk or floral or anything like that maybe a little myrrh that i can pick up mainly just vanilla , tobacco , and scent
4	this is not a lotion but an opaque oil it is heavily scented and goes on greasy i find that if i put it on early enough ahead of my makeup , i can go ahead and apply makeup over it , but immediately after application my face feels oily and not a good surface to apply makeup thankfully , the scent also fades , because it 's really strong and would not only clash with my cologne but is overpowering so close to my nose i love scented products but this one is a bit much even for me one pump is enough only for my face if i want to include my neck and decollete i need two how does it work \? my face feels moisturized and plumper after application i do n't think it does a whole lot to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles that are already there i have to trust that it 's working in the long run , but short term there 's not a lot to go on basically , i like how my face feels after applying this serum , but the scent is really too much for me
4	bought this color because i saw it used in a number of different layering images with other colors i have n't yet done any layering but this is a nice shimmery pink this is a uv cured 'gel' polish done properly , a cnd shellac will last 1 3 weeks i have softer flexible nails my nails need polish to keep from breaking and get longer acrylic kills my nails and if a salon does a generic gel polish , they often file my nails making them really damaged and weak so i decided to buy the cnd kit do it myself \( also saving me in the long run \) before shellac i gave up on polishing my nails unless for a special event because it would peel off in a day what a waste to spend all that time painting and drying for it to peel away the next day i type a lot at work as well as boxing and packing stuff so i am tough on my hands shellac is the best system because it stays on but comes off easy without any filing it lasts me about 7 10 days on dark colors , because i chose to take it off when i can see growth at the cuticle on many others , it will easily last 2 weeks
5	very nice
5	this is one of my favorites great summer polish coverage is good this is more of a matte polish no frosty look here
3	the ones at sally beauty work just as well for a fraction of the price also , my dog got a hold of this one and destroyed it hence , my review is meh fragile and overpriced a bit too impractical for me
5	i 've been using this for about a year and it is hands down one of the best product to treat adult cystic acne i never really got pimples in my 20s but as soon as i turned 30 , those keep popping up i'm talking about the stubborn , painful big pimples that take weeks to heal and will leave a very permanent scar when they die this drying lotion should be used as soon as you feel that painful spot on your face i use it at night after cleaning my face and sleep with it on by morning my pimple will be gone or significant decrease in size for the larger stubborn ones , it will take a couple of days to clear up but use it as the first sign and you wo n't be sorry
5	love essie and i love this color one of my favorites
5	i use this shaving cream with my brush and double edge safety razor , and it works great just a little bit of the cream with some water goes a long way for me , so i think this tube will last me for a long time i really enjoy the light scent , and it does n't leave my face feeling dried out i'm not sure yet if it 's more economical than my regular proraso dry soap , but it would definitely consider buying it again i thought it was a little interesting that the product is from italy , and the packaging is almost entirely in italian
5	good , nice color
5	well what do you know \? actually great mascara buildable , tube like so does n't run or smear , just slips off with warm water no problem with slight fibers that add length so appreciate that it is in a nice brown !
4	it looks super dark going on , but after you take a shower , all that color washes right off kinda disappointing but good all the same since if you do happen to streak , when you wash the tanning guide color off , no streaks will be left on the skin i used it three days during the last week for a wedding on the weekend and i had a nice , natural tan that was n't dark or obnoxious
5	very nice
5	i requested this for wife who happened to notice it on my queue when it arrived i did all the and assembly for her just to score a few points she worked on the headset for a while until she got it exactly right for her she it up and let it run for the recommended twenty minutes she said that it was not uncomfortable and she could sense a slight effect from the toner after turning it off she has to wait twenty four hours for the next session this toner takes around twelve weeks to produce results so further updates will be made to this review when anything noteworthy occurs
5	this is a terrific product it has kept my nails long all winter i had given up using nail polish until i found butter london
5	love this ! the lighter color is kinda sticky and no a fan of it but the other side , the lip stain is perfect ! i love it !
4	this is a decent physical sunscreen it applies evenly and has little odor there are many claims with respect to the ingredients that are not tested there are cheaper alternatives such as nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href neutrogena sheer zinc face dry touch sunscreen broad spectrum spf 50 2 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 neutrogena sheer zinc face dry touch sunscreen broad spectrum spf 50 , 2 fl oz a
5	this gives you a healthy looking tan all year long it does wash off easily it has a bit of a scent which is n't too strong it works , that 's the main point
5	light and airy ! it goes on so easy and it is a little shimmery but i like it a lot plus it 's all natural
2	this product is overrated no major improvements , little to zero irritates my skin
3	first off , if you 're looking for standard sunscreen , look elsewhere this is definitely not your everyday , average sunscreen if you 're looking for something to wear daily to protect your face and you have the cash for a higher end product , than this might be for you i hate putting on sunscreen every day as i feel like it always makes my face oily this definitely fixes that problem , as it does n't leave a residue like most standard sunscreen , yet still offers 34 spf protection i'm very fussy about fragrances and found this one to truly be almost fragrance free and not at all offensive if you 're sensitive it 's light enough to be worn under foundation if you regularly use that overall , its a nice product , if you 're not put off by the price
5	same elegant , expensive , not long lasting smell as majority of other oribe products \( either great smell or perfume free \) , although not making a whole lot of difference in the care of my mid length , naturally curly , dry , freeze prune hair , also dyed with natural hair colors , i like it better than dry texturing hair spray daily use and also as needed of light moisturizing cream and gold lust oil is more efficient for me , i live in low humidity colorado i do n't think i would buy it again since other oribe products are much better for my hair type in my climate
5	mom likes it
3	i'm a , i always have my hands in water around the house , i'm a and use and scissors so , my hands are kind of a i try to take care of them and sometimes pamper them with cream and cotton gloves covered with latex gloves i was happy to try this hand mask , which is basically the same thing as my cotton gloves latex gloves cream routine , but with a higher end hydrating cream you put your hand in the inner fabric gloves that come with this kit , secure the at the wrists and wait twenty minutes later , you peel off the gloves and throw them away results well , my hands felt utterly soft and hydrated , but for 9 50 a pop , i think i 'll keep doing this myself if there had been maybe 10 of these things , i might change my mind , but 9 50 for one application \? nope
5	love this essie color ! essie polishes are some of my favorite nail polishes they self level better than any nail polish i have ever tried they coat very well , and for the majority of the colors essie nail polishes are very opaque they dry very quickly as well this color is a very cheery , vibrant sky blue almost completely opaque with only one coat one of my all time favorites !
4	i 've been a fan of baxter of california products in the past i really like the quality , non irritating ingredients and the longevity as well this is a nice system of a cleanser , astringent and moisturizer they do n't all have to be used every day but i'm sure that the benefits are greater if you follow the system as recommended the cleanser is nice , nothing too harsh and not too drying the astringent has a mild mint scent but it is really hard to smell the moisturizer is thick and blends in quickly i know that some say this is a great set for women too but i think it is designed for men and should , for the most part , be used by men it seems to be a little stronger and the moisturizer a little too thick for the average daily use for women
5	beautiful color
2	jury is still out on this and i will update as i keep using it but so far i'm not that impressed i notice no difference in any wrinkle or line and the filling effect is not so much i know nothing really will completely fill in wrinkles but so far this has done absolutely nothing
4	i feel like these products are missing something the clay mask love the way it feels on my face it feels tight and does n't cake or dry out my face it smooths on very well i do n't see why i only have to leave it on for 3 5 minutes i followed directions because i did n't want a red face anyway , after 3 5 mins i washed it off it came off as easily as it went on i did n't feel any different when i washed it off like i said , i like the tightening effect while it 's on 3 5 does n't seem long enough the makeup cleanser works like a charm does n't take a lot and the smell is faint the gloss kinda burns it did n't cause damage to my husband 's face but it stung the smell is pleasant and the substance is gel like also , leave on for 3 5 mins i 'll be trying the last mask tomorrow and will update if you 're thinking this is the mask that peels off , like the videos , you 're wrong this wipes off by using a towel and warm water
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	great !
3	the cuticle cream is really rich it has a mild , pleasant scent a little goes a long way i rubbed this into all of my nails and cuticles i followed up by using a moisturizing hand cream the cuticle cream made no difference in the last few days i have not seen improvement in my cuticles nor have i seen shiny nails i will continue to use this and will update if i have positive results
3	i'm forever in search of the perfect blue this is getting there color wise , but the formula leaves a lot to be desired it 's thin and streaky , very sheer i wore it over white and it looks kind of terrible i 'll be changing my polish asap
3	i was a bit disappointed when i received this lumarx trimmer the design looks great but the plastic feels cheap and lightweight the trimming blade is relatively strong and it does come with a comb attachment which makes it ideal for trimming beards or mustaches but the overall construction always left me thinking that it would break fortunately this has held up fairly well with moderate use but considering the price this should be better quality
5	good
5	works
5	this is the best curling iron i have ever owned i have wavy , short medium thick hair i am 50 years old i put it on the highest level to try it out because of the reviews i had read it is fast do not use it like the older curling holding it for a few minutes roll your hair up and less then 2 seconds take it out the temp control is away from your hands that means when you are holding it your fingers do not change the dial this is truly the best iron i have ever owned the shipper was right on time no peanut packaging huge bubble packing i am more the satisfied
4	this has a pleasant scent it is not too floral , and it does not have the strong alcohol esque odor properties that is a turn off for me and can be found in many scents it 's a nice , somewhat sophisticated , and not typical for a masculine scent , so it may be appropriate for unisex others have noted that this does not last long i suppose this is true , but i could smell it for many hours i am sensitive though , so this is probably different for different people i'm no connoisseur , but from what i can tell , this is was a good price for a product with this quality i 'd compare it with other varieties in the same price range at a department store the packaging is nice , too i do n't care , but some may ! plus my wife likes it
4	i like this cream , but i'm more inclined to use it at night it 's a bit thick for day use , and feels oily plasticky it makes my skin tingle , which might be the ingredients nourishing the skin \( niacinamide , vit c and vit e \) , or it might just be strong and causing slight irritation i have no idea what most of the ingredients are it 's a bit expensive for my budget , so i 'd have to see major results to make the investment so far , results are n't any better than with cheaper aha creams i 'll update if i see any difference later
5	i was so excited to receive this because i have long been a fan of t3 i recently replaced my t3 dryer that lasted 4 years and also have the twirl 360 curling iron , which is another favorite of mine so i had high expectations of the performance of this flat iron thankfully it delivers \( and this is coming from someone who has been flat ironing her hair for 15 years and has tried a range of flat irons from low end to high end over the years \) the buttons are pretty minimalist so it took a at the directions to figure out what the lights mean and what the appropriate setting is for my hair , but after looking the first few times its intuitive for context , i have long \( mid back \) , thick , naturally wavy , color treated blonde hair my hair is also very dry year round \( lingering side effect from past accutane use \) and is further prone to dryness because i have it bleached and toned at the salon accordingly , whenever i heat style i try to minimize damage by using the lowest heat setting i can , going over each strand once \( if possible \) , and wearing my styled hair for a few days with the help of dry shampoo this flat iron helps me very much with this if i blow my hair out as straight as possible before hand and work in small sections i can get by with a single pass for the most part if i flat iron my hair when it 's been allowed to dry wavy , it does take a couple of passes to get everything perfectly straight , however i also do appreciate that even though my hair is thick and coarse i do n't have to use the highest heat setting i also love the experience of using this it is so light weight \( i realize that can also make it feel a bit cheaper than other brands , but since i have so much hair i much prefer the lightness of this even if it means you sacrifice the quality look of the materials a bit \) the nice long swivel cord is handy and the plates are well designed they grip the hair perfectly so it does n't slip and hair does n't catch or get stuck and i find the width of this iron perfect i know some people recommend thicker flat irons for longer hair but i personally prefer this width because it 's easier to control and makes it more versatile for doing curls and i will admit to loving the rose gold it should n't matter but it makes for a very pretty iron that i'm proud to have out on my vanity honestly , at this present moment i ca n't find a single thing to dislike about this straightener and given my past positive experience with the brand i'm hopeful my love for this flat iron will continue in the future would recommend !
4	the color that comes out of this sunless tanner is incredible i am very familiar with sunless tanners and used st tropez tan foam with a mitt for the application on the first application , i only had time to put it on for an hour but had planned to have it on for three i felt really sticky with it on and wanted to rinse it off i was very impressed that the tanner left my skin darker than my dark tanner that i leave on all night frequently i am not a fan that it feels a little sticky and i cannot wear certain clothes because it has a bit of a residue however , it leaves a wonderful gleam on my skin that looks healthy and natural my skin looks healthy , hydrated , and cared for foams usually do not last as long as sprays and i prefer to have more on hand i also notice that its hard to tell when foams will run out so i am not sure i like that it is a form of application i will update with time but the color is beautiful , natural , and it actually lasts like a tan pros 1 very dark and natural tan achieved unbelievably fast 2 smells like perfume without as much of a sunless tanner smell cons 1 quite sticky when on until rinse 2 if you miss a spot it is noticeable because of the drastic difference in tone however , it is pretty easy to blend 3 watch out for your elbows , knees , and edges of wrists because it grabs color in those areas 4 the fade is noticeable and blotchy
4	i do n't think there is anything magical about this cream but it does a very good job of moisturizing dry patches on my face without making me feel greasy it has a lovely orange blossom scent that is not too heavy unless you really hate scent i had my husband try this \( he really does not like scented moisturizers \) he did n't mind this the scent does n't linger for long strong scented lotions tend to irritate both our faces this one did not i wore it during the day at night it was fine under makeup did not make my skin break out it is paraben free non comedogenic made in france
4	i like this la roche posay mascara but am not in love with it here is my honest opinion of pros and cons pros it separates my lashes without clumping , it looks very natural , washes off easily , does not flake , good for sensitive eyes cons it does not make my lashes appear thicker , curly or longer \( which is highly desirable for me \) , pricey overall , this mascara is good for people who want a natural look and have sensitive eyes i like this mascara but do n't love it because i prefer mascaras that give me volume for my sparse fine eyelashes
5	i have never been disappointed with any jane iredale product and this is no different it is not too bold and it feels light and healthy on my face it 's a great color and i love the quality and behind jane iredale
5	this gel nail polish stays put for three weeks , or more when used with base and top coat i have kept it on without changing for three weeks i changed only then because my nails needed filing and new growth was visible you also need to set polish with uv light sold here at amazon i love it no chips at all this stuff is i wash my hands numerous times daily in addition to using hand sanitizer multiple times nothing breaks this stuff down nails look the same the 21st day as the 1st day only takes a total of 30 minutes per manicure salons charge 40 or more for gel nails for 100 for everything you have enough manicures to last more than a year check out cnd nail website for colors and tutorial
3	i do n't believe this product has offered me any benefit in terms of what i wanted , the relieving of puffiness under my eyes i have very few wrinkles in the eye area , but do have noticeable puffiness my husband said he thought it looked a little better , but i believe he was simply trying to make me feel good the manufacturer suggests using this one to two times week i 've applied the treatment 2 times since receiving it because i was anxious to see if it would help perhaps longer term treatment would show more improvement two main problems with that solution are \( 1 \) the vine review process would have been exceeded \( 6 weeks to use all the contents at 1 week \) , and \( 2 \) the cost factor would me from going forward beyond this trial maybe 2 treatments are to be a proper judge , but i do n't believe i will use the balance of the package the mess of dripping fluid is sort of irritating and i would rather go for a facial once a month for that amount of money thank you for the opportunity to try this product , but it seems there is little that can be done to prevent the effects of aging
5	this karuna single hydrating facial mask worked wonders on my dry face it left my skin soft , with a sheen and glow that only much younger people have it 's now hours later and my face still feels soft and smooth and not at all dry i will definitely use it again these facial masks are for single use they should be used right after cleansing your face i put it on as directed and waited 20 minutes there was enough product on the mask itself that , i gently eased some of it onto my neck \( by the way , although i use a daily moisturizer , it does n't moisturize as well as this mask 's ingredients \) i removed the mask and it i was n't sure what to do with the excess on my face so , i lightly blotted with a tissue and let it dry my skin looks and feels so good that i did n't use my foundation just mascara and lipstick for the day this is an excellent way to revitalize your face !
5	keeps my skin clear
4	this stuff is expensive there i said it it is amazing that they can charge this much for just 1 oz of product as for the product itself , it goes on a bit greasy and definitely seems to have a positive effect the blurring effect that the product description mentions is subtle and does help with minor imperfections i cannot say if the effects are long term but for the few hours that this stays on your skin there is indeed a difference if this product were cheaper or came in a larger quantity it would be excellent but at its current level it is too expensive and too small to say it is a 5 star product
4	i took the advice of another reviewer and bought small container first time used i was very surprise of how easy and well it covered bald spot in back of head stayed on for 2 3 days and not messy wish i had found sooner instead of wasting a lot of time trying to cover up back , bald line update forget the spray it is hard to use , sprayer sticks and substance not good plain air spray just as good , if not better
4	i love anything lafco makes ! great product last long time burn wonderful and smell great !
5	this is a beautiful floral fragrance that does n't have much , if any sweetness to it , making it great for warm weather wear without fear of it becoming cloying the fragrance has an excellent longevity , easily lasting from to without fading into nothing the initial application can feel a little strong , but it dries down nicely within 10 to 15 minutes even after washing clothing , hints of the fragrance can still be detected in areas where it touched the skin during wear
5	this clay mask has exfoliating grit that works at dead skin as you apply the clay , it goes on easy and covers well just keep it out of your eyes as it has a menthol like cooling effect as the clay goes on and stays cooling as it drys it never feels too tight or dry like many other face clays so its not uncomfortable to leave on while you wait i use a soft cotton wash cloth to clean off , use warm water to soak and wash away , it does take more work than others to clean off the best way is to rinse off is in the shower my face shines and feels fresh after i use this clay mask , it exfoliates clearing away dead skin leaving my face feeling clean and new !
4	nothing special don t notice any improvement or change but less expensive than most other eye creams and hyaluronic acid is an excellent skin plumper
3	i have the definition of porcelain skin it is fairer than fair now , that 's all well and good , but for the occasional gathering , i would like a little more warmth i was hoping this would give me that kiss of color that i need but , instead it came out a little on the orange side which has been the same experience i have had with considerably less expensive products now , both the news and the bad news is that it was gone very quickly \( under two days \) this is good for me , but maybe bad for someone who wants a longer lasting product \( now , this could also be a result of fairly aggressive skincare regimen \) if anything , i might avoid using your clarisonic while trying to develop some color for me , i think i am just too pale for these products to ever look normal but , i think if you had medium skin , it might add depth
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	this cologne has a very light scent that is not overpowering or cloying it is more of a fresh and clean scent to wear during the day the smell lingers so you do n't have to reapply or use very much recommended
2	i purchased this and the cream vichy roll on deodorants to compare the two while this one is easier to apply \( it has a roller ball which the cream version doesnt \) and dries faster , this made me break out in a rash which the other didnt something is different in their ingredients that made this one cause a rash
4	my wife 's favorite flower is peony , but this color might not be for everybody it felt nice and moisturizing , and was n't sticky \( which is always a plus \) it lasted a decent amount of time , as well
5	great lip gloss almost a lip stain but it does not dry out your lips i am a lipstick addict always looking for the perfect color and texture this is wonderful there is a bit of sheen to it and is not too obvious it stays on after eating and drinking highly recommend
3	when i saw a hint of dryness under my eyes compared to the rest of the face , i went straight for this product because of the hyaluronic ingredient in this cream yes , it hydrates the skin very well , but not with satisfaction the cream is thick , heavy , and does n't absorb very well if i happened to get too much , i could n't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face there were some mornings i woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy , but i was n't 100 sure if the eye cream causes it another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because i use very little st a time , so i should never buy the jar package again as it 's not very sanitary over a long period of time after 3 months and the jar was still almost full ! !
5	great sheer , gold shimmer nice and fine sparkles , very subtle but noticeable
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand

5	i am not usually a fan of too many night creams because they 're usually heavy greasy and it me out to think of something like that on my face all night trapped on my skin between the pillow there are very few that i have ever liked and that felt light enough and absorbed enough for me to tolerate this is one of them i apply just enough to cover my face and lightly moisturize and i do n't end up with a heavy or greasy feeling i also do not wake up with a slimy greasy fave in the morning other night creams i have tried have made me look and feel like an oily mess the morning i love that this one is not like that my skin looks and feels so soft and smooth when i wake up it does give a very youthful look and feel to the skin no , you wo n't look like you 've had plastic surgery , of course , but you can definitely see an fine lines are plumped out a bit so that they are less noticeable my only deep line runs across my forehead and i 've noticed that one looks better too this is a nice size jar and when combined with using a light hand during application and the fact that it is a thick , rich cream means you do n't need a lot when you use it and also means it will last quite awhile so the price is very reasonable there is a light scent i think it smells good and is not very noticeable at all if you ever accidentally get to much product out , it is lovely on the back of your hands to use up the excess and not waste it it really softens them and makes all the teeny tiny lines disappear
3	this eye cream seems about average in performance to me , with the same level of hydration as \( for example \) nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href peter thomas roth mega rich intensive anti aging cellular eye crme 0 76 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 peter thomas roth mega rich intensive anti aging cellular eye crme , 0 76 ounce a , but for three times the price for 1 3 less product on the plus side , it does n't irritate my skin at all it hydrates pretty well , sinks in quickly , and does n't leave my skin feeling at all greasy or sticky fine lines caused by dryness fade with this like they do with any decent eye cream , but i do n't notice any impact on regular age creases i usually use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href algenist genius ultimate anti aging eye cream 0 5 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 algenist genius ultimate anti aging eye cream , 0 5 ounce a , but was excited to try this cream because the positive reviews i 've heard of obaji products given the hype and price , i'm pretty disappointed and will go back to the algenist or peter thomas roth products \( or if i'm feeling like i can afford a premium product , i 'll buy la mer 's eye cream instead , which is the best i 've every used but very expensive \)
4	overall a good product though we found it a little stickier compared to similar products while it seems to hydrate , my skin does not feel moisturized compared to moisturizing products it also seems to work as a product booster without creating a shiny skin surface
4	i gave this foundation a four star rating because it seemed a bit thick and dark to me having said that i almost never wear make up other than mascara so my expectations may be impossible to realize considering that i need high spf as well as good cover up for occasional film and women who are accustomed to wearing foundation and powder every day very well might find this product relatively sheer i must say that i am grateful for a product that works under heavy lighting and has a number 30 spf count as well
2	i feel this product made no difference in the appearance of my hair much less as it states to make my hair thicker
4	vichy 's sunscreen is a light and pleasant sunscreen it looks and feels just like any other sunscreen , an off white creamy lotion , but the vichy does not have a strong odor and absorbs quickly , without a greasy residue the slight fragrance that the vichy does have smells pleasant , and is barely noticeable in fact the vichy reminds me more of a facial moisturizer with spf 15 sunscreen that a straight up spf 60 sunscreen with that said , i wo n't be slathering the vichy on my face daily , since it is not intended to be a daily moisturizer rather i 've been using it on my forearms and neck when i'm working in the yard , or spending a lot of time outdoors it 's kept me protected for hours , and i have n't noticed any skin issues or irritation when using the vichy all in all a pleasant alternative to typical smelly and sticky sunscreens
5	it is a very subtle shimmery gold i 've worn it on top of other colors and by itself very pretty
5	i love vinylux but i do n't like this color
5	i have used baxter and l'or eacute al and several other aftershave products in comparing vichy i note a couple of things vichy has almost no smell , which i prefer for vichy , a little goes a long way and this 2 1 2 ounce tube should last a little while some of the other products , like l'or eacute al 's , offer spf protection and vichy does not in this product if you prefer a smooth , silky and soothing aftershave experience , vichy is for you if you are looking for spf protection in the same application or you like the brisk menthol experience you will not find it here over all , i really like vichy homme
5	great product it lasts 2 weeks
5	fast delivery , great price !
5	this is a delightful scent that adds just a dash of excitement to an evening out it is very pleasant and i highly recommend it over an expensive perfume lovely scent
5	this is a great polish it 's a red jelly cream \( mostly jelly \) which makes it super shiny it 's more cool toned , which tends to be universally flattering i love it i feel like it 's a perfect red to wear anytime of year
5	now that i have been introduced to dermablend products , i can only wonder why on earth other cosmetics manufacturers have not the value this line offers it is easy to apply , blends well , and i almost want to call it cosmetic surgery in a jar that 's how well it works if you have some scars , dark shadows under your eyes , or other marks that are bothersome to you , here 's your opportunity to make them all but disappear i 've used some on the back of my hands the veins that have started to appear when you skin ages no longer can be seen needless to say , i am thrilled with this product and will definitely continue to purchase it and recommend it to others by the way , this is great for men , as well !
2	i usually love jane iredale , but this blush is a disappointment i know the picture shows the tube , but it is really small , 3 tall with only 2 of product inside i thought i had and got lipstick at first the color is nice , goes on very nice , but smells i think they made it smell like chocolate yuck seriously , when is the last time any woman put chocolate on her face \? i buy jane iredale because of the superior quality , quantity and non allergic smells , etc this one failed on all three so , if you would like to smell like chocolate , buy this blush
3	it works okay , but not great basically , it 's just as good as the average stuff you buy at the supermarket i would n't go out of my way to get more
4	i am pretty light skinned and i live in las vegas but i tend to wear pants and long dresses so my legs are pretty light compared to my arms i used this vichy moisturizing self tanner lotion for your face and body on my legs i found that this added a very light brown tone to my skin that was pretty even and non streaky i waited as the directions state a few days to do my next application i did not have to complete a third application during the week i found that it has a flower smell that is a tad overwhelming to me i wish there was no smell to be honest or even a coconut smell would have been better in my opinion i did not see any residue on my pants or other clothes after applying this and it was streak free and non greasy ! the best part of this is that it is easy to use , non streaky and goes on even
3	this is pretty effective at drying out pimples and helping new ones not get as large my issue is that it always causes the surrounding skin to get very dry and flaky , even when i try to just put a tiny spot on just the pimple this is not everyone 's experience , so perhaps i am just more sensitive to the alcohol in this than most people i 've read online that some other products can be less drying to the skin , like blemish out pink spot \( contains less alcohol \) , which i'm going to try next
5	i am always looking for high quality make up especially foundation and mascara i have very sensitive skin and suffer from rosacea so it seems most make up either irritates dries my skin or the rosacea i am very pleased to say that japonesque is very friendly to sensitive skin i am fair skinned and shade 05 was a perfect match for me the foundation is very light and even though it advises to use a brush to apply , i found that applying with my fingers worked just as well i highly recommend this foundation ! ! !
5	this really helps !
4	two facts 1 im in my 70s 2 im currently on a very weight loss diet i thought that this nuface device may be effective to use from the start as id like to avoid that saggy face look you often get from rapid weight loss i have no intention of having surgical so when i was offered this facial toning device it seemed like a good idea ive been using the device for 5 minute sessions on a daily basis i find the electrical stimulation uncomfortable but not painful in any manner the only real pain is in the price point but this is still more reasonable than having the therapy done professionally i have very sensitive skin but found the gel that is included with this device did not irritate my skin so this is good ive seen the larger toning device and think id prefer this smaller size it fits comfortably in my hand there are instructions included but i tend to like to go to the website or youtube for the videos so far i really think that my under chin area is tightening although ive not had friends or coworkers mention anything yet
4	i usually buy the cherry stila lip and cheek stain but after years of getting the same thing , i wanted to try something a little different this color is more of a fuchsia or blue based red it stains darker than the cherry stain while it was n't bad on my lips , i could n't use this shade as a cheek stain i actually lost this product before i finished it but when i re ordered , i went back to the cherry one other things about this product and maybe it 's just me , but i also go through this product very quickly , which gets expensive the stila convertible color compact is the same price as this product and has the bonus of a mirror it is n't exactly a stain but is long lasting i have several convertible colors and ca n't recommend them enough
3	when i ordered this conditioner , the product page did n't list the ingredients , so i was unhappy to discover that this has multiple silicones to achieve that smoother look although using silicones to this end is common practice , they can create build up over time and weigh down hair , and , for those of us who are sensitive to it \( yes , i took one for the team and tried this for several days \) , it can cause skin irritation and even eczema but does this obliphica conditioner work as promised \? pretty much it does contain keratin for hair repair i have blonde , wavy hair that on curly if i have the right cut and do n't style it perhaps because of the silicones in this conditioner , i am able to style my hair more straight than usual , and it has a nice gloss the obliphica conditioner does n't deliver the kind of silky magic that an argan oil conditioner will , but it still detangles and makes my hair feel nice if you have curly or wavy hair and want a straighter style , this conditioner works toward that end it did rob some body from my hair , but , when i'm going for a smoother look , that 's not necessarily a bad thing this is n't the best conditioner i 've tried , and it is n't the worst debbie lee wesselmann
4	this is very gentle cleanser there is almost no fragrance at all , and what there is is super mild a little goes a long way and thank goodness for that , as the price is crazy expensive i use about the size of a very small marble its not the least bit harsh i use it with a shiseido brush , which works really well a data hook product link linked class a link normal href shiseido the skincare cleansing massage brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 shiseido the skincare cleansing massage brush a

4	michelle phan is ultra when it comes to make up this palette of shade play concealer has a lot of potential , especially if you like to play around with different make up styles , if you do you will love this item my basic knowledge is simple but i still like the potential of this , especially when i have time to play around with different effects i like the overall formula of this concealor makeup it 's very smooth and goes on very easily the larger pot of make up you can use as a pore reducing foundation , and a little goes a long way you can add the other colors for make , or up mix up different shades for the perfect concealor i have watched some of michelle 's videos in the past and i love the way she can do anything with make up this palette has the potential to create shading and light and different techniques there is a little brush included in the kit and there is an empty well to mix the colors this is a fun product to play around with the make up is long lasting and does have a nice feeling too much can be heavy the compact itself is nice it includes a nice sized mirror and a small mixing brush i also just use my finger to apply this concealer the amounts included are okay small pots but a little goes a long way but if you mix a lot of product at one time , it probably wo n't last long except for the larger pot the larger pot of color is a little dark there is one light , light shade and then the others are dark , but you can mix the different colors for whatever effect you 'd like people who love to play with make up will probably really like this product
5	most luxurious shave cream i have used just a dime size gave me a face full of very rich lather the smell was very masculine but not overpowering the finished effect on my skin was soothing i do n't like a face full of lather for a shave just a nice comforting barrier and v76 does that well
2	ive been using this for a few weeks im not really a fan the grit is way too large ive used several other brands of face scrub some have a lot of grit some not so much but ive never used one that had such large as this its simply uncomfortable
5	my wife got a bottle for her birthday last year and loved it it has been a staple in her own personal perfume department she loves the hint of jasmine which she loves as well as the family she puts it on and it stays with her for hours and every room that she goes into it smells that way for a long period of time which i personally love some of these perfumes colognes seem watered down they smell good at first but then disappear but not with this product great london scent from the great burberry !
5	one of my favorite products ! !
5	when i first opened my baxters of california moisturizer , i noticed the simple white tube with black lettering it was different from the usual decorated womens beauty care products also , it is unscented , without that powerful floral scent when i read the info on the box i realized it was a mens beauty care product ! but , i love it just a pea sized dollop of moisturizer is enough to apply to your face and neck it smooths on easily and does not leave a persistent greasy feeling after weeks of use i have noticed a change the winter weather usually plays with my skin and leaves it dry and flakey right now , it is smooth and well hydrated and the only change to my skin care regimen is adding baxters at 20 per tube , the price seems steep , but only needing to use small amounts each time makes this a bargain so , no matter what the box says , baxters is non gender specific in my eyes and i highly recommend it
5	my hot pink key west color to go with my other one , a great touch up for at home collection and of course , what woman does n't want a sexy neon pink to make every guy trip ! \?
2	this is not really neon you have to put 3 coats since it 's sort of clear the first coat and streaky the second coat
5	i find this soap to be so creamy and leaves my face soft , clean , and i love it , feels great !
5	favorite all purpose pomade
4	brighter than it looks on net
3	nice looking dryer and good value b c it comes with so many nozzles and a diffuser attachment , but i found it to be on the heavier side \( heavier than my ancient , era t3 \) so i decided to return it
4	this tanner kind of has a greenish tint however , once it dries and sinks in , it dries tan the smell is not bad i wish it lasted longer seems to only last a day or to after showering , even when leaving it on for 8 hrs i will try the darker tanner st tropez makes
5	works great
5	one of the most challenging things for me is to find an eye cream hat will be potent without causing irritation obagi offers two types of eye cream one very moisturizing and this one that is rich with vitamin c that helps brighten dark circles around the eyes vitamin c is also strong antioxidant and it is perfect for eye wrinkle prevention this product contains some very potent ingredients kinetin \( plant hormone that promotes cell , i e skin \) kinetin when directly applied to the skin helps reduce the effects of skin aging including roughness , fine wrinkles , blood vessels , and uneven pigmentation , for anyone curious this compound is extracted via from 's zeatin is a plant hormone derived from zeatin belongs to the family of plant growth hormones called and was discovered in corn from the zea , zeatin is linked to anti aging or the slowing down of aging in the human body it is most often found in moringa plant is a so called eye pro 3x reduces the appearance of skin aging around the delicate eye area glycerin , ferment , root extract , saccharomyces \( \) extract , centella asiatica extract \( and heals wounds skin significantly faster than untreated wounds \) , panthenol \( vitamin a \) , calendula \( one of the most healing , anti inflammatory , herbs on the planet \)
4	when i first opened my shipment i was impressed with the unique design of the pump there is a button on the side that when you press , the perfect amount of moisturizer appears for you to apply i have never seen a pump like this before and hope that there is a way to make sure that i can get every drop of the formula out of the container as i use it i have used competitive moisturizers for several years now and i have to honestly say that i like the fresh scent of this product and the effects after using it for a couple of weeks have been noticeable the only reason i did not give the juice beauty stem cellular moisturizer five stars was because i thought it was a little expensive for the amount you received and that i did not like the name when you first look at the product i ca n't help but wonder what kind of stem cells are being applied i read the list of ingredients and found that the formula is made up primarily of essential oil and organic fruit juices , the combinations seems to work for me i enjoy the pleasant citrus scent of the product and would continue using it if it were not so expensive for the amount that you get i'm not sure how long my 1 7 fl oz is going to stretch benefits fights free radical skin damage and firms skin with a proprietary blend of apple , grape lemon fruit stem cells infused into organic resveratrol rich hydrates and moisturizes skin with organic antioxidant rich jojoba and shea increases cellular turnover and improves skin luminosity with vitamin c in clinical trials 100 reported improved hydration 87 5 reported reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around eye area 87 5 reported improved skin tone and luminosity and 75 reported improved elasticity of the skin i also noticed that my pores seemed to decrease in size

5	we are longtime fans of jack black products my husband has been a convert since i pushed the first sample on him and threw away his bar soap he loves this product , as well he normally uses the 3 1 on his hair he likes that this has conditioner and he notices a shine to his hair that he did not have before it has a nice smell , a very masculine , clean scent this will be added to our rotation and will be the perfect present for my husband come holiday time
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	my wife loves this nourishing oil as this is a very gentle and smooth oil that makes her skin feel more supple as the oil helps hydrate her skin as her skin tends to get dry and sometime flakes at the nose area , she is currently using a moisturizer and the weekly face mask but with a few drops of the mario badescu rose hips and rubbing it over her face , she says it does wonders to her routine
2	polish chips very easily love the color
5	this truly is an amazing product for the price ! it makes your scalp feel amazing and you honestly do feel and see a difference in your hairline
5	i reviewed this with the most dubious and attitude imagine my surprise when i actually saw results as i have gotten older , my lips have become thinner \( unlike the rest of me \) , and those little lines that my mom and grandma had started to appear on my own face \( oh , the horror ! \) after 3 solid weeks of use , i can tell you that this product did poof up my lips noticeably , \( but not obnoxiously \) and did it without burning or irritation \( unlike previous versions i has tried \) the lines decreased , too i used it once in the morning and once at night , and did occasionally use it during the day , too i used a little lip liner and then rubbed it in to get rid of the harsh lip liner look it worked great and now it will be part of my daily regimen it made a believer out of me and a repeat customer maybe i can put off that treatment for awhile
5	my wife 's favorite moisturizer great heavy duty moisturizer that is highly concentrated its consistency is thick and almost you only need a little bit to get the job done it has a really nice aroma , but is not many other moisturizers you wo n't be smelling it all day long you will love how your skin feels after this sits on your skin i like to use it at night and use the hydrate facial moisturizer during the day both great products , but this one has an extra kick if you have drier skin highly recommended ! ! !
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation

1	zinc oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one , blocks both uva \( 320 400 nm \) and uvb \( 280 320 nm \) rays of ultraviolet light chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks zo is insoluble in water , used in many , in ointments , creams and lotions non irritating , non allergenic and non comedogenic , used by as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts zo must be non nano uncoated ups 2 zo which has a mean particle size greater than , when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body , do not enter the bloodstream , and are not a threat to human health spf is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from uvb rays than someone wearing no cream if the sun unprotected skin in ten minutes , for example , a person wearing spf15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer 150 minutes while uvb rays are behind the redness of sunburn , uva rays damage the skin 's dna at a deeper layer both radiation types can cause skin cancer the eu recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a uva protection factor that is a third of their spf active ingredients octinoxate 3 0 , titanium dioxide 3 0 , zinc oxide 9 0 inactive ingredients , butylene glycol , citric acid , cyclopentasiloxane , dimethicone , dimethicone peg 10 15 crosspolymer , , crosspolymer , iodopropynyl butylcarbamate , iron oxides , lauryl peg 9 dimethicone , lecithin , methicone , , octyldodecyl neopentanoate , phenoxyethanol , extract , purified water , silica , sodium chloride , sodium hydroxide , this is a brand that on their website it is claimed a micronized physical sunscreen , with the cosmetic benefit of a skin perfecting sheer tint for the face all those chemicals along with some zo does not make it a physical sunscreen this mix is worse than a tar i got to this product since one of the top reviewers for a diet has written a five star review on this mix it is amazing to see what some get to charge for damaging chemicals in the name of marketing

5	i really like this body lotion by vichy it moisturizes nicely and absorbs into your skin pretty quickly without leaving a greasy feeling i like the scent which is refreshing and i find the strongest note in the scent is roses it is a pretty strong scent and may be too strong for those sensitive to strong scents but i like it the consistency is good also i cannot wait to see how the firming ingredients work with this lotion and will be back to update my review
5	i love this product
5	i live in las vegas where it is hot and i sweat all summer long i have been using and have noticed that my bahama t shirts have started to stain from my but the stains wash out however very to have these stains almost like the old hyper t shirts from the early 90s decided to switch and gave menscience a try first off no scent going on which i like , i do n't need scented as i wear cologne second it lasts all day when i get home from work i do n't have any unpleasant odor coming from the underarm area finally not my the fact that it does not stain my shirts is worth the high price of this deodorant it will be my go to brand going forward
5	foremost , like all correctors , concealers , foundations , etc , the key is blending so , apply this lightly \( very lightly \) and then blend out with a beauty blender if you need just a touch more , layer a bit more then , blend add foundation and then blend this will provide the most natural and uniform look the product itself is easy to use , offered in many shades \( so there is one that will surely complement your skin tone \) , and treats skin with care i am allergic to just about everything i did not have any form of reaction to this product for me , that says a lot about how gentle this formula is \( for me \) also , i love the convenience of this very small tube i keep this in my makeup bag in my office for the occasional mid afternoon touch up vichy products are phenomenal if you have never tried their line , grab this corrector and give it a spin i think you will be pleasantly surprised !

1	like elta md but this product leaves residue on my face does not blend in \(
5	works extremely well i have saved over on laser hair removal follow the directions !
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	love this new color !
4	this is a good product that definitely makes my face feel soft and clean however , i have n't seen much , if any , improvement in my acne also it 's super drippy and messy when i use it because water gets stuck in between the brush and the device itself i will continue using it because i do like the way it cleans my skin but i do n't think it 's a miracle worker for me \)
5	absolutely amazing ! ! ! i had no idea a hair dryer could make my hair so smooth , healthy and shiny ! ! those ions really make a difference and this dry beats every dryer i 've tried the t3 , , , ghd , chi etc works especially well with the bio ionic blue wave brush for the best blow out of your life ! i could never blow out my hair like my stylist but now i can with this amazing dryer ! i'm getting compliments because my hair is so so shiny ! ! ! thank you , bio ionic ! im in heaven ! ! this seller is great too for the price and the quick shipping ! !
4	this is a good sunblock skin protector my \( only \) reservations are these one has to reapply this product more often than is convenient , and more often than one has to apply other \( quite good \) products that are competitors to the la roche posay serum since , in addition , this product is quite a bit pricier than many of its competitors , unless i discover when this bottle has run out that my skin is transformed , i am unlikely to want to get a second bottle of it
5	my favorite cnd color have ordered it several times and i always use it quickly it 's a great color and gets lots of compliments
5	i ca n't say that this product actually makes my lips fuller , but it is very moisturizing , and the moisture sticks around for a long time unlike most non balm lip products , though , this one is n't sticky at all it goes on silky smooth and stays in place for hours it 's not the best product to wear under a lipstick , as it keeps the lipstick from adhering to your lips , but it 's great for before bed or if your lips start feeling chapped
4	i have oily sensitive and acne prone skin i am learning that scrubbing it is not a good idea for me my skin will try to produce more oil and protect itself when scrubbed this is but i had to stop using it just to figure out how to handle my particular skin otherwise , i do love pevonia products
5	nice top coat very shiny
5	great shampoo that leaves your hair smelling great and your scalp with the cool relaxing feel and smell of peppermint this shampoo gives you an experience that is both and physically satisfying
5	as usual essie has another hit ! great color for a mani pedi for summer looks great on most skin tones shipped quickly too
5	this blower brush is fantastic especially for ladies with baby fine hair my me it gives it bounce and volume and shine it 's easy to use and you get very hair air which is something lacking in the other blower i had to return i recommend this product highly
5	i used have used this polish base now for almost a year with no problems i am allergic to the base that is used with them very easy to use , and does the job its intended to do prepare you nails for the polish
5	why would anyone spend this kid of money for a hairbrush \? because it is just that awesome and it will last forever my son would cry about having his hair brushed until we got this brush we 've used it ever since and i ca n't imagine ever using a different brush on either of my heads
5	this shampoo leaves my hair feeling silky and looking healthy great product at a great price
5	love this color !
5	i 've been using this hand cream for several days now , and i really like the scent it smells faintly like real apples , not the least bit or overpowering my husband is sensitive to perfumes , so this is a real treat for me to have something that smells nice that does n't give him fits \) it 's a decent hand cream , you just need a small amount , about the size of your pinky fingernail i used way too much the first time and it left a greasy residue , but if you use the right amount that wo n't be a problem
5	beautiful set and lots of very useful stuff love the smell it 's a light smell that 's not the typical powder smell which i do n't care for it 's a clean smell this is a great brand i 've used it from time to time when it was on sale i highly recommend this set as a gift for a new mom
5	this is my second purchase of this item ! i love bioderma products i live by them i ca n't get through any of my without them this is so great for oily skin with a lightweight moisturizer under it it does a great job of filling in those pore and keeping that oil from eating through your makeup most of the time , unless someone is extremely oily , i really do n't have to touch up much i will use this on combination skin types , as well , if they are pretty oily in the t zone i love this serum !
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	i love this shade cannot be without it
5	great finishing powder , however be aware it is not a translucent color it will definitely lighten when its applied it sets everything so nicely and holds makeup nicely i use a lot of moisturizers before putting on liquid foundation which can make it feel like one touch will smudge it away this stuff really helps set it all in place and adhere to my skin quickly great to use even for under eye highlight if used a lot , or a soft dusting for setting versatile product and its a lot perfect to carry for touch ups during the day if you need to
5	love zoya !
5	i loved this bright shade a lot so much that i bought two ! i am african american but i think it will work for many skin tones it 's great !
5	i have to admit i was skeptical about the claims of this eye balm i have been using this just a few days and noticed results already the dark circles under my eyes are disappearing and my eyes look less tired vichy aqualia thermal eye balm feels great when it goes on , and it definitely helps more than just using my regular moisturizer
5	a little goes a long , long way i really love this product , in particular , and the mario badescu line , in general
5	i got this color once in a salon and loved it , but other salons do n't seem to have it vinylux is great lasts at least a week for me by buying the color , i can not only do my nails myself , but can bring it with me to salons for them to use if they do n't have it love it !
5	leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out every time !
5	great
5	this pca phaze 1 facial wash for oily skin is the best i 've ever used it cleans thoroughly and does not leave your skin feeling uncomfortable the pca line of skin care is very good i have used several of their products and have had good results
5	beautiful color
5	with enough for two 3 step facials , this kit is easy to use and gives skin quite a boost i confess that i already love the bliss brand , especially the hand products rescue facial in a box is perfect for those days when you only have time and energy for a fast and no nonsense treatment leaves your face feeling very soft
3	ahava comes out of the tube blue and with a very pleasant aroma i typically use the art of shaving , and my new got to , by cowboy , both of which are are creamy and thick ahava rubs on thin and stays thin , and does not lather my shave brush merely wiped it off my face rather than create a fuller lather , and i had to reapply to the test brush area shaving was so so afterwards , yes , skin feels good , moisturized , so there are certain properties to the cream that work , and the main ones , the actual shaving part , not so much
5	perfect
2	this is a generous supply of a premium skin face cleaner it is a gel and has a very \( grassy green \) scent which is somewhat sharp and refreshing one point about this that i did like was the scent it comes in a squeeze bottle that does n't have any other air outlet so , if you do n't squeeze out a lot , it tends to get sucked back into the bottle i found that i had to squeeze out more than i needed and had to waste the product because of the distribution method the cleanser is a thick , clear gel which lathers a little when you rub it between your hands it 's not especially soapy and rinses off cleanly i will say that i am older \( 52 \) , fair skinned , with skin that tends toward dry rather than oily , but overall tends to be closer to average or normal i do not wear any kind of make up i usually wash my face with fairly generic soap \( ivory or \) and then apply a fairly heavy moisturizer after evening showers with this product , i stopped using soap on my face and only used the obagi cleanser for about 3 weeks during the first week , this left my skin itchy , dry , and flaky despite my having applied the same heavy moisturizer after washing my face as i do when i use soap after about three weeks , this some , but was still happening to some extent it also was leaving a residue on my skin or not exfoliating as soap did as i could scratch off a white substance when i was either scratching my dry skin or scrubbing my face with my fingers i had to start using an abrasive exfoliating mitt after using this cleanser to make sure i got everything off on the plus side , my skin was left feeling soft and pliable compared to soap \( which can often leave skin feeling dry and tight \) however , in the long run , the and lack of exfoliating as well as the higher price make this a product that did n't work out for me
5	we have long , thick , wavy hair and this cream really does keep the frizzies at bay
5	i have been using this products for years
3	it looks watered down
5	with winter coming on , my heels start drying and cracking i usually just try to use some of my body lotion but it does n't work well i 've been using dead sea essential for several weeks now and i find that my heels are softer and i am not having cracking issues this will be a product that i will use daily for the next couple of months and will certainly buy again next year
4	the concealer is rich , creamy , and blends easily while i like the feel and quality of the product , the color was n't quite right for me when i tried to cover a minor blemish and used enough for coverage , it was too dark and i could see the spot it worked much better blending an area with a few age spots and uneven skin tone i like it enough to continue using it but next time i would choose a slightly lighter shade
5	great color if you are fond of the new green colors shipment fast and i am satisfied with this seller
5	phenomenal !
5	this is the best sunscreen i have ever used i have literally no pigment and it keeps me from burning does not sting eyes perfect expensive but well worth the money
3	there were several things i liked about this product first of all , i liked the consistency of this night cream i expect my night cream to be thick we are to protect our skin during the day and repair our skin at night , so i want my night cream to be substantially thicker i also liked that it did not have an overbearing smell i also was glad to see a small spatula for dipping into the jar and getting your desired amount of cream out without having to use your fingers and therefore contaminating the product i also thought there was a substantial amount of product in the jar what i did n't like was the price i find 115 00 for a facial moisturizer to be excessive especially since it did n't provide any better results than a 38 00 of moisturizer i normally use i used the entire jar before i wrote this review because i wanted to give a fair and unbiased review the jar lasted almost a month and i used it every night overall , i would not pay this amount for this cream again as there are other moisturizers that work just as well for a lot less
3	it is very hard to get a good color and skin undertone match either the concealer is too light , or like this one , too dark this concealer is also much greasier than \( e g \) l'oreal concealer
3	not sure i saw a huge difference with this time i liked it , but it was n't that of an improvement slightly expensive and wasteful compared to some at home treatments i have done using gloves and balm not sure i would buy this item again
5	great shade of red for summer and beyond ! also , it stays fresh looking for more than a week
5	as someone who has partly hooded eyelids i am always looking for a liner that wo n't transfer once i put it on this went on so easy and i was able to draw a line smoothly and quickly i was also able to wear it for the whole night out and it did n't transfer to anywhere else on my face so that 's a major plus
5	love mario badescu ! !
5	like product
5	i got this for my sister who lives in florida she loves this primer , so i'm adding it to a little pampering gift basket that i'm sending to her because she 's pregnant with her first everyone is focused on stuff for the kiddo , i thought she might enjoy some of her favorite goodies to pamper herself during this amazing time in her life \( of course i'm sending stuff for the baby too , but it will be separate \)
5	this shampoo is so hydrating , you may not feel the need for conditioner after using it my hair tends to be on the dry side and i 've found this shampoo really helps my hair is soft and smooth using this product
5	this nail polish is the best ! yes , it is kind of expensive , but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful
4	so i love essie and the color was rich and beautiful , though the picture is not really what it looks like in person the color is more of a pink , then light coral it took almost three weeks to be delivered
5	my wife really loves this liquid foundation , it was easy to apply , stays the whole time , is even on her skin and caused no irritation to her \( she 's a person from the indian \) she told to give it 5 stars
5	i have medium yellowish olive skin tone which has been difficult to find a neutral this shade tea and crumpets is beautiful ! i was looking for a color that would match as closely as possible to my natural nail bed color , and i was not having any luck ! finally i went less pink , more neutral tan , and this is so flattering ! contrary to what i thought , it 's lighter than my skin tone , and it actually brightens my fingers i mistakenly thought lighter colors would darken my skin , but this is a splendid exception \( nice word splendid \) it 's definitely a frost , and i find it streaks a little , but i'm not a professional , so that 's fine for me i'm just thrilled to death i finally found a color that is n't goth or weird or screaming for attention i like subtle and refined , and this is it ! it 's so pretty !
3	so far this is n't my most favorite toner i have been using co bigelow toner from bath and body works for years and i love how soft and smooth my face feels after i use it this one does n't leave my face feeling as smooth i have never used a toner that had a spray top , and i'm still not sure how i feel about it the convenience of being able to spray without having to dab the toner onto a cotton ball is nice , but i also feel like i am wasting a lot by not being able to spray perfectly onto my face without missing the co bigelow contains witch hazel which heals my face quickly after a blemish , this does not have that they cost about the same price , co bigelow is a little bit cheaper , and i will still continue to use them even after trying this one toner in general is great for closing pores and making your skin softer , more firm , and it goes on really easy
5	nia24 usually has wonderful products and this one is no different the intensive recovery complex is a thick , rich cream that really moisturizes and seems to protect and nourish skin a little product goes a long way and since you mainly use this for the facial area , this jar will last ! i really like to use this on my neck area as well this makes a great night cream and i highly recommend it ! !
4	great for short hair little pricey my partner and i recently our hair meaning we got at least 12 off she had about 16 taken out and had it substantially thinned its now a couple inches past shoulder length she absolutely loves this style wand now when she had thick luxurious mid back length hair , \( she 's mostly with some african american in there and would get offers on her hair consistently \) she hated wand style curlers whether its this brand works that much better or her hair length , we ca n't be totally sure , but we do know the lighter and shorter hair makes the cone shape so much easier to deal with no more fussing to keep hair on there and coming out with under curled hair i went to get her a different barrel for it and was a little shocked by the price while we are big fans of how smooth and shiny the hair comes out and how great the curls look because of this product , both the overall price and the alternate barrel prices seem a little high make sure you use the glove ! i thought i did n't need it , and as a result things got little hotter than i would have wanted also were pretty sure from using that if you have long , thick hair , you will have the same problems with this one that we have had with other ones and will end up very very very unhappy maybe they should start putting a little on the end ! \? \? ! either way with short hair , were now fans !
4	i have terribly sensitive skin i 'd hoped that the very low amount of retinol in this cream would mean that it would be ok for me \( when i was younger i could tolerate this level of retinol \) but my skin still had a reaction to it , and i had to discontinue using it oh well it did initially feel gentler than most retinol creams , though i am able to at least use up the remainder of it on some small surgical scars elsewhere on my skin , though \( just not on my face or the delicate dcollet area of the chest \) it does help with that it was my dermatologist 's idea i had n't realized before he suggested it that retinol helped with improving the appearance of scars i guess it makes sense that it could improve the texture and appearance of scars , since it helps with wrinkles so that may be a good suggestion for those who could n't tolerate it on their face , but have an almost full tube of this left !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	extremely gentle , this water like fluid can serve as a cleanser , makeup remover and toner it is safe to use on the eyes and adequately removes eye make up it has a rose fragrance that does not linger apply with a cotton pad i found it worked well as a makeup remover and as a toner however you have to use an amount to thoroughly cleanse especially if you wear a full of makeup , i e , primer , foundation , blush , mascara , liner , shadow , contour , highlighter and lipstick it does n't require rinsing nor does it leave the skin feeling tight or irritated a good product especially for those with sensitive or dry skin
5	i really like this product it is super smooth i removed my makeup and was surprised that it did not feel tight it was as if i had already put on my moisturizer lotion it also is not heavy feeling i usually develop rashes from lotion as i have sensitive skin but with this product my skin feels great ! i highly recommend this product you will not regret using it
5	great spring summer color with a bit of shimmer goes amazing with white stripes dots flowers as always you need the shellac curing light , top , and base coats
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	love the smell of this facial mist it 's nice to keep in the refrigerator for hot days or you just need a pick me up
5	this may very well be my new go to sunscreen this lightweight , fragrance free lotion goes on smoothly and feels good on my skin , absorbing right away without the greasiness , residue or ive experienced with other suntan lotions in the past the active ingredients are octinoxate , octisalate and 8 zinc oxide , which are meant to protect skin against uva and uvb rays and infrared a the promise is that it offers antiaging repair and it will take time for me to be able to that claim the lotion does need to be reapplied at least every two hours and at this price , its a true investment in your skin if you can put aside the cost factor \( and certainly these days , many people cant \) , its a very fine sunscreen
3	i have very curly hair and usually use john 's frizz ease secret weapon touch up creme it does a great job of keeping my hair smooth and in ringlets or less defined curls depending on how much i want to put in it costs about 6 at any grocery store or convenience store when i have ordered this product , priced 25 , i have expected a lot more from it than from a 6 alternative my curls felt a bit more and that is all ! i used it several times just to account for weather , my hair 's and styles , but it did not do anything more than other much better priced products the hair stayed soft and lightweight , frizz free and defined , but there are several other products under 10 that do the same i guess i was looking for a lot more for the price something truly spectacular , or just simply much better if i was going to pay four times more than my current product
3	at this price point i wanted to love this product the skin around my eyes is definitely more moisturized which makes my makeup go on more evenly in this area i am 33 years old and have mild lines and some puffiness but i did not really see any reduction in either after weeks of use , twice a day i give 3 stars because the added moisture has made my eyes seem brighter and i do like that but i have to take away stars because it does claim to reduce puffy eyes and fine lines , which i do not see personally i kept waiting to review to give it more time , but i think after 2 weeks i have been fair
5	love the julep color treat nail polish it went on smoothly and not too thick dried fairly quick have had the polish on my nails three days and not having any chipping i did two coats because i have very thin nails great nail polish i do love the color it is just muted enough to go with any outfit eventually i would like to try a tan color
4	this is a wonderfully lightweight hair dryer that works well and dries my hair quickly the warm setting is plenty for my needs even with long , thick hair the high setting does dry my hair even faster but is uncomfortably hot my favorite thing about this dryer is how nice and light it is it 's so lightweight that it almost feels like a toy even with half an hour of continuous use drying the hair of several of the kids my hand did n't feel tired the reason i'm giving it four stars rather than five is because of the cool button and the cord the cool button is very easy to press and once pressed it keeps the dryer on cool the button is right where i want to grip the handle so i have to a somewhat awkward grip in order to keep from pressing the button the cord is the other reason it 's a matte finish cord which is very long i can see this being an advantage in a professional salon but at home the cord becomes and makes this otherwise very lightweight dryer heavier than it needs to be since you 're having to hold up several feet of cord while using it
4	the color is between light shades and medium shades it is warm with what i 'd call yellowish tones it goes on easy enough it is heavier coverage than any foundation makeup i 've worn this covers light freckles , red spots well it does not cover very dark or black spots it covers scars as far as color goes , but does n't do anything for the uneven surface that they leave it settles into lines , fine and deeper a lot , so it can age the skin it 's comfortable for a couple of hours but then it begins to make my skin feel like it ca n't breathe i started wanting to take it off my skin felt oilier after i took it off , like the mask put my skin 's oil production into my husband has a tattoo i tried to cover with this it covered the lighter colors up well , but it would n't cover the dark blue or the black lines it is water resistant it went through a shower without coming off , and hubby wore it into the pool and it stayed on where we 'd put it it does come off with water based wipes though , if you wipe at it i used dove baby wipes and it came off with some wiping effort wiping at it seems to take it off pretty well without any special removers , but if just gets wet , it stays put at least for a bit it comes off really easy and fast with neutrogena makeup remover clothes it does stay on longer if you use the setting powder it is n't particularly shiny , but the powder helps keep it from rubbing off if you rub your face , and it gives it a nice matte look and a bit more coverage it 's ok i probably wo n't wear it again all over my face because i just felt like my skin was suffocating with it on i might use it for camouflaging red spots , freckles , spider veins , or bruises for tattoos , if they are light colors with little black this may well work , but the dermablend stick does a better job of covering those , especially if they have dark colors and or a lot of black this is very good coverage for smooth scars it also worked very well on the blue bruise i had on my leg it covered it very well
4	another fine product this one sprays on dry or damp hair before styling it gives some shine and apparently builds body over time i 've used it off and on for years , whenever i want more shine do n't use too much or it will look like you are conditioning your hair experiment with it to find out how much you need less is better in my case it provides serious thermal protection for your hair as well nice product !
5	this is very nice for the face i used this with my clarisonic brush and it has a refreshing feel after u rinse your face i use the peel to this brand also and i love it
5	i like the bb cream by jane , its actually good for your skin it looks nice , once you get the hang of application , it 's very thick , and to work with but its easy enough to get the hang of , a make up egg or sponge is key to the finish , unless you like a wet , or shiny look i do n't so i dab the sponge around , actually applying the cream , with the sponge works really well also it leaves a good natural looking finish
4	day one \( 2 december 2015 \) i have been noticing some puffiness around my eyes and darkening circles so i thought i would try a new eye product i will come back and update this review to share the results in a few weeks i do like the way this eye balm feels when i put it on and would probably give it five stars on that alone , like a light gel however , i am not fond of pump dispensers because , over time , i find that they will occasionally out too much product and i prefer the control with a tube or jar again , i 'll update this review with my results in a few weeks or sooner , if there are results sooner my fingers !
4	this is a beautifully packaged gift set with a 3 3 oz bottle and two for your purse travel i absolutely love to have of favorite scents for travel the bottle is rectangular shaped with glass it looks very nice and classy in my perfume collection only negative with packaging is that the cap does not stay on well it rests on the top and can easily fall off if you 're not careful this scent is very different from the burberry brit edt i actually have a 1 7 oz of brit edt and it was my perfume the original brit is a spicier , scent and i think of it as a heavier , nighttime winter scent burberry brit rhythm floral is lighter with a bit of perfect for year round use official notes are british lavender , orange blossom , vetiver , musks to me , this is a clean scent , like soap this is n't a bad thing at all it fits well with scents i typically like \( e g michael daisy , versace pink crystal \) and i could see myself wearing it to work from september to april it is less overpowering than the burberry brit and it is great for daytime the throw does n't seem to be super to me i ca n't really smell myself all day in the same way as i can smell myself with brit or with , although i know the scent lingers overall , this is nice scent but it is n't really super special or unique i do n't see this as appealing to true perfume if you like clean smelling fragrances , however , you should give this a try
4	have n't used enough to see a difference smells nice i guess but still need time to determine it 's a yay or nay
4	the formula is a little thin , but its a beautiful color for summer i use it over a white polish \( like i do with most essie brights \) and it looks beautiful
4	our work has soap in the bathroom that is really drying i love having this lotion at my desk to use after washing my hands it works so well that sometimes i feel like it 's not even necessary everytime i wash my hands , which used to be the case i 've used the l'occitane shea butter products before and i would definitely purchase them again !
4	this was a little darker than i expected but it covered well it was a little obvious i had something covering the spot did n't seem like it totally blended but if i used foundation i bet it would blend better
2	i am a big fan of the pca line , it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne \( mainly the a c serum , cleanser and nutrient toner \) however , i have been using this product for over a month and i do not see any change on the lines under my eyes i am so used to having fast results with their products that i expected to see some kind of change after the first month what i can say about this product is that as small as it is i still have a lot left , pca products can be expensive but they do last a long time i will write another review on my third or fourth month update i am a big fan of pca skin products and i had to update this review because i really believe i was sold an expired toner and other pca products i stopped buying pca products on amazon after comparing them to the ones i bought with my dermatologist or skinstore com i noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products i bought on amazon where different and where able to come off sadly i ca n't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore com or skinstore com will not even give a small discount on pca products \( pca products are always excluded from promotions \) the a c serum i bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have the newer \( better quality \) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump with that said choose the vendor carefully
5	the grand daughter loves the liquid camo foundation for covering her freckles and the cocoa is dark enough to blend in with her summer skin tone she says it 's easy application and it lasts all day on her she 's very happy with it and told me to tell you guys that for cover up it works great ! ! now to ship a case to day \( oh yes , she 's still very much alive at 94 i believe \) the grand daughter 's been using it everyday this summer i can attest to that , so she must like it and i know she 's ordered more i guess that as an endorsement by action , not words five stars !
5	the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me they earn being in a higher end category in my opinion they do not seem to be scented or too chemical the jars , tubes , compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make ups i have many favorites among them , yet i believe they all stand very well on their own some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula , and this appears to be an optional extra also , there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product i hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line , including compatible products along the way respectively 1 loreal dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo \( no spf \) 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body \( no spf \) 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out it smelled good too it was a truer color in my eyes , since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such also , some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly , and i liked them because they looked very ethereal , as with the pink violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light i have aged , and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product , one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture i especially enjoyed the blur ones now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here , including most recently , a lovely reddish brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put , a super mascara , another lip paint , some face tone enhancers , and a creamy to dry , light colored eye light , among others i am happy to see more high end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike , especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd 1 dermablend cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received , and it is my very favorite it covers my skin imperfections well my first attempt with it doesnt count , since i spread it very thin , allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through and i went out that night wondering why this was happening i hadnt read the instructions yet first of all , i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product , and second , i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have dry patches on spots now i get it ! this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all this product is soft and smooth it appeared to be a very thin product at first , and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it it is lovely if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections and when i apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended , and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make up can be it has alone a bit of chroma to it , as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) , in my opinion , unlike many other cover products i have used alone , they gleam in the light more than my other cover make ups , without chalkiness very nice the other purpose for me is that it has a \( 30 spf \) sunscreen all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have \( 25 spf \) or lower , and not my needed \( 30 spf \) that my dermatologist recommends she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage i score 1 , 000 here for this as well as the other qualities of this line the two colors i have are both medium ones , one a bit lighter , and both appropriate for me , especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here and i realize you may not have this type of a menu , but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) needed the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder , with the cotton puffs it hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for this particular product is very fine , not grainy , and perhaps a bit creamy it definitely blends in well it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier , keeping the crme , bases , foundations , from smudging to hands , clothing in various ways , since amazon is not going to know my exact skin color , i have experimented , i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using the various loose powder shades together dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades \( separate jars \) when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose a what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder , as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder altogether , with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match , thus prolonging my experience b also , with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face , and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks , nose , chin , forehead , i will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium toned translucent powders as described , allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion another plus 1 , 000 ! for me i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally and not necessarily all over my face and neck u have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough , though you may find it unnecessary you can still have a dimensional look i like to play with the powders , yet , when i am in a rush i will make errors , not being subtle , and not dusting before other products also , i am 62 , and my baggy under eye application errors are the most noticeable i get rid of this bagginess first i will use the powders now , especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications , or with the high quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) listed below and as well as their other foundations all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type , for example they are nice for a youthful complexion and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less noticeable pores , and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined in my case i am fine , and safest when i am well rested 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make up applications the mist is n't as fine as i had expected , but it works for me even with dusted powders it will make a difference it is that simple for me 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder , which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look yet because i preferred the varying built up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme , i missed something with trying this last as before i was too quick to judge i had applied it very thick and then i went out i thought to myself that is was mask like , yet nice moist cover not only can i spot apply this creamier liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers , i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look , then applying more product wherever as needed i also can add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray for a fresh stay with or without powders win win win 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo ! ! \( no spf \) this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator , in separate compartments while this color is quite dark for me , one quality , besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired , is that i do not see wrinkles really maybe the thin layer or the creaminess \? and the staying power , especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray also , i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck the darker color , applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin i do know that is stretching it though i have n't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product , since this is a very dark color however , i suppose this might possibly work though this does go on thin , and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look very nice camo cover product ! 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body \( no spf \) wow again i hadnt understood at first how i can use this , as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium \( my shade \) i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me , yet thick as i applied it and silly me ! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have double win with this product results ! this is a creamy roll up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much i love the idea of having a smooth body skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful , and long lasting dermablend professional leg and body make up however , im mentioning this quick fix product first as im partial to a more natural , yet youthful , look , only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through this is my personal preference it is n't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make up , yet it is the product i will use first especially during the day i love it 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) it is so nice to wear tights , stockings , or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses , and on ankles under pants above boots however , during cooler months especially , it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look , it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing i absolutely loved the look when i put it on and then darn , i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin this might not be problematic for you with full body applications , as for me on an occasional basis as desired yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother , and will please you i believe as i have expressed that this product renders a nice , airbrushed look , and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into it just did n't muss up and rub off 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) this works fabulously it is creamy and it stays put it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme , because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends , even as i am in my home , shades drawn , as my dermatologist has warned about i have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot this covers very well , looks flawless with or without other products , yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line i have it in a tan color , and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin lovely plus 1 , 000 , and very smart very nice products indeed enjoy !
4	edit march 2018 i 've changed my mind i like it now i think the problem was i got it in the fall and i was more in a spicy pumpkin mode it is spring now and this has a green tea springy vibe it 's still to expensive this is extremely expensive for a fragrance that belongs in bath body at the mall i was not impressed the smell is fruity , like apples to me anyway it comes out strong and overbearing like the stuff at the mall then in about an hour , it smells okay then an hour after that , it is gone
1	very disappointing
3	the good points it feels great nice and cool going on that is a plus but , honestly my undereye circles do n't look any better it is supposed to make your eyes look brighter and less tired maybe it will do this for other people it does n't do this for me i am a 48 old caucasian woman who has dark circles under eyes i think this might work with puffy eyes well if get puffy circles under your eyes i'm thinking this might really help but that is a theory i expected great things out of this it just did n't work for me but it might work for you i m going to give mine to my 19 old daughter maybe it works better on younger skin
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	after one use my smile was sparkling white ! i will continue to use use as directed for best re
4	my face typically eats blush i 'll put it on in the morning and it 's gone before lunch i have found great success with the tarte 12 hour amazonian clay blushes which stay on until i take it off , but cream blushes have never worked for me in the past until jouer tint i got 10 hour wear from this as a blush and the color was soft and naturally pretty on my fair skin \( the color petal looks pinker in person than the picture on amazon , more like a muted rose color \) i was super impressed i applied it with a synthetic flat brush at first , which ended up being a little too heavy but when i took a clean kabuki brush over it , it blended out perfectly i did tap it on my lips as well and was happy that there was no discernible taste or scent i think it would be nice for a no makeup look on the lips , maybe more if i layered it as a brand , jouer has been hit or miss for me , but this tint is lovely it 's half the size of my jouer bronzer \( another big hit for me \) and the packaging design allowed me to connect the two products easily
5	i rarely get zits but when i do they come in pairs lol this is a pimple ! gets rid of it probably i would say in 3 days this helps me not pop them
5	love using this soap
5	salicylic face wash works very well for me and i had heard wonderful things about obagi chemical peels so i was excited to try this i was a little nervous it would be drying , but it 's not it does a pretty good job of cleaning makeup off my face i 've only had trace amounts of makeup left after washing you only need to use a little bit so this bottle is going to last a really long time if you like the feel and smell of menthol you will love this
5	very crisp scent perfect for all day wear or that special evening occasion i like the fact that this is not too overpowering nice that ride on a warm foundation love it !
5	love la roche posay and this is a great body lotion moisturizes well but does n't leave ur skin feeling oily there is a very mild scent which i actually like
5	this gentle rejuvenation soothing cleanser by obagi is great for people with sensitive skin it has the consistency of a light , soothing gel and is unscented i 've been using the cleanser for a couple of weeks and i really like it a little goes a long way , so this portion should last about 6 months with twice daily cleaning
4	i gave this a shot when offered a chance as a vine reviewer because i like two of the p products , one effaclar and i forget the name of the other they come out of the tube as lotion but turn into a foam as you rub them between your hands and they work amazingly well i'm a guy with an oily face and they remove all of the oil without feeling harsh i have occasional acne and have dermatologist prescribed gel that works well \( it 's anti bacterial and has peroxide , or something like that in it , as it my pillow cases ! \) but i do n't like to use it all of the time , and this toner , which i use before bed , seems to reduce how often i need to use the other stuff the only thing i do n't care for is the scent the cleansers seem to me to have no scent , but this does it 's not horrible , just unpleasant and it lingers for a bit
5	this product holds the fibers in place for several days as i do not shampoo my hair everyday and only occasionally have to add fibers to certain spots
2	on the one hand , this product does n't burn or cause skin irritation on the other hand , it does n't do anything at all
5	i'm obsessed with mario badescu , this particular cream in general it is a heavier , greasy feeling \( but only for about 20 or so minutes \) until it absorbs i currently use this at night along with the hyaluronic eye cream and the vitamin a d e neck cream the combination have my skin feeling soft and rejuvenated i am somewhat of a product junkie , and the mario badescu line is definitely one of my favorite
4	i like this serum , and notice a definate difference in the skin on top of my hands , which was starting to look crepey i 've tried it on top of moisturizer and on it 's own for me it 's too much in the hot humid climate i live in to have both a sunscreen moisturizer on and this product during the day although i used the serum sparingly , it still felt sticky and tacky and i had to wash it off after an hour or so however , i do use it at night over my moisturizer with no problems i do notice that the fine lines on neck and mouth are softened as i said , i also use it on the thin skin on my hands and have noticed a big difference , much more than using the hand cream alone there is no odor to this product that i can detect there is a con though the name is misleading calling it an hydrating serum i took this to mean it was a more natural product with more herbs , herb in it here is the ingredient list aqua \( water , eau \) , glycerin , propylene glycol , dimethicone , carbomer , gingko biloba leaf extract , panax ginseng root extract , triethanolamine , dimethiconol , caprylyl glycol , cyclopentasiloxane , ethylhexyl , hexylene glycol , sodium chloride , phenyl trimethicone , , lecithin , phenoxyethanol , ci 42090 \( blue 1 \) , ci 19140 \( yellow 5 \) if you look them all up the majority are man made silicones a product which in the cosmetic industry is used to fill in wrinkles , retain moisture etc is this for you \? you have to decide most are generally recognized as safe for use in food and cosmetics if you use the ewg website , some are use with caution personally i do n't feel a few drops a day will harm me but i will keep trying more chemical free products to see what works for me i did like the product but was disappointed in how it was labeled i 'll have to think if i 'll buy it or not
5	my granddaughter has been asking for these nail polish the day after i ordered them she loves the color and the nail product they came all together and in very good condition they came on time thanks teresa
5	i love this polish essie has so many beautiful colors it is easy to apply and stays on without chipping removes easily to try a different color or use the same color
5	i 've waited a bit to write this review i 've got a good size bald thinning spot on the crown of my head a couple of months ago i decided to try toppik after my barber recommended it it has taken a while to get the routine down and learn to apply it just right i 've been very happy but yesterday proved to me what a great product this is i never told anyone what i was doing people kept asking me if i had just gotten a haircut they knew something had , but could n't figure out what it was yesterday i was out for a walk my partner of 30 years and a friend while i was walking in front of them my partner said what did you do to your hair \? i cringed i thought that he had noticed that i had put something on it and it showed i him what he meant he said that my bald spot was gone he then got right up on top of me and looked at my hair he could not tell what i had done , but my bald spot was gone my friend touched it and said that it was soft if i could fool them i could fool anyone even looking for it they could n't tell like i said , it took a bit to get the application down just right this should not discourage you , you just need a little practice i wash my hair , blow dry it and apply the toppik , using a hand mirror to see the back i use the toppik until i get good coverage , brush it and then use a light spray of hairspray it kind of seals it on the hair and keeps everything in place , but it is not stiff most days this is just a minute or so you do n't need to if you just let your hair dry naturally , but do n't use the toppik on wet hair i think that it would clump also the blow dryer give the hair a bit of volume which helps give it a try !
4	this is a nice moisturizer for my face and it makes my complexion look a little brighter it does n't take much of this serum to apply an even coat on my face the fragrance is pleasant , a nice floral scent and it does n't stick around for long my skin is very dry and at first it would soak this lotion right up i feel like my skin is more moist and supple now , and the lotion is n't getting sucked into my skin quite as fast it did sting a little bit the first few days i used it , but that sensation has been gone ever since my complexion looks more vibrant and less worn or tired , so meg 21 cell therapy seems to be doing its job for me
5	love the color
5	i reviewed this product too early , before i saw any results it definitely hides the appearance of lines around my eyes however , i'm not sure whether or not when i stop using it , they will it also works on other problem areas , such as on my neck for that alone , i 'd gladly purchase this cream
4	i chose this to cover some imperfections blemishes rosacea and it works as described i use a bit of this first and then my regular foundation for the rest \( or just this alone \) the coverage is clean , it goes on smoothly with a bit of warmth on my fingers , and stays on fairly well most of the day
3	the colors are much more orange on me , after smashbox 24 hour eyeshadow primer or swatched on my hand , than they look in the pan or on my screen they look the same in person and on my air , for the record they are easy to apply smoothly , and did not flake , but the lighter shade is a very metallic gold that stays shiny in , to me , an unflattering way obviously , of that 's the look you are going for i prefer a more blurred hourglass ambient look with less flat out shine the darker color has that blur quality more , but is far more copper on me than the soft toasted tan it looks in the pan i think there 's some copper shimmer \? it 's a bit more obvious than i was looking for , but does highlight my eye color for the record , i have a medium for a white person , neutral under toned complexion with reddish overtones , dark ash brunette , with hazel eyes the color of green with a coppery ring in the middle
4	i ca n't say it 's substantially different in performance to the other , cheaper foaming gels one can buy at any given store , but this shaving gel has a really nice clean scent it 's fresh and crisp like a subtle cologne so it gets points for that otherwise it shaves nice enough but you 're getting a similar gel to what you can buy from target for like three bucks a can
5	always happy with this brand i 've used this foundation for years
5	i love the way this feels !
5	super colore five stars
4	i love this deodorant it really does work for 24 hours longer , really it is pretty easy to apply once you get the hang of the applicator it is still an aluminum based product , but there seems to be a lot less chemical based agents aside from that than your typical deodorant it is not yet listed on the ewg skin deep database , but when it is , i 'll be looking it up asap if this really is a healthier iteration of a functional deodorant , i will gladly spend the additional cost my only are these even though it says it is non marking , it absolutely is take care to let it dry soak in before putting on clothes not too long , but just a minute or two and take care with letting dark colors rub over the underarms the deodorant will show up and need to be cleaned off the nature of the tube will inevitably cause issues as the tube starts to empty , and create waste for this price , i will for sure open up the tube and apply in another way but i'm not really looking forward to that i 'd really prefer some sort of push applicator that uses the product efficiently to the end
5	antica farmacista is a fragrance company known to high end in the united states , europe , and asia the bergamot and ocean hand cream i got to try is really a perfume that soften hands the scent is strong and long lasting but not at all overpowering you can pair it with the scented bath salts , soap , or shower wash for a layered scent in no way would i wear my normal perfume or cologne in combination with this hand cream for at least a few hours , the scents would compete as far as i can tell , the company does not sell a perfume in the bergamot and ocean scent which would solve the problem for me the scent is lovely and soft and the cream is not at all greasy on my hands i would recommend especially if you 're interested in the other items in the collection
5	i am very impressed with the dermablend products the medium coverage is great for me it is liquid and easy to apply it also has an spf of 25 , which is a necessity for me this formula also hydrates and lasts for 16 hours \( make sure you use the setting powder for that 16 hours of smooth , non cakey look that evens out your skin tone and hides imperfections
5	as advertised
3	this is a tiny pump container of sunscreen it sells on amazon for a crazy high price \( to me \) and i was curious to see what the big deal was the pump dispenses a thin stream of lotion which has a light citrus fragrance which is completely by sunscreen scent on me it really lingered i could never wear this on my face the up side is how great this feels on my skin it is like velvet , no greasy slick or sticky mess i put it on my arms and the skin actually looked better , more hydrated and smooth unfortunately the sunscreen y smell overwhelmed me i can get that for a couple dollars at walgreens the container i got has a 7 month lead in to expiration which i think is fair for a price dense ingredient product it will be super easy to use this up in a week so 7 months will be no challenge i just ca n't see spending this much on a teeny bit of sunscreen so this will be my first and last container
5	product would be best for those with white skin and peach undertones light beige is more muddy looking than the picture suggests i honestly would not recommend this brand for persons of color if that is not you , it is a five star product
5	i just love this color \)
1	shave cremes need lather and a feeling of fullness there should be a richness to the lather and one should not have to use too much of the product to achieve that products like the art of shaving \( my personal favorite \) , kiehl , and lab all have excellent shave cremes that when applied with a brush give a sense of moisture that leads to a smooth shave this baxter product is even using alot of the creme on the brush , i never quite had a feeling of satisfaction with the richness of the lather i had to use alot of the product to equal much less of the other three i have referred to now , i use a brush to apply the shave creme baxter shave creme was one of the most disappointing i have ever used
4	this is not the original eau de rochas but a from 2010 this one is a lovely aquatic white musk with notes of bergamot \( lemony \) iris \( a light powder \) this is a very clean spring summery scent it 's not complicated no no fruits , just a simple , clean , inoffensive scent when worn in moderation the sillage is moderate going to arm length this lasts nearly 8 hours on my skin becomes an up close scent near the end
5	i specifically use this product for my lips it makes them soft , plump and supple gotta love this stuff i 've bout it three times now
4	favorite color
4	i 've tried many different powder foundations and this one definitely provides a decent amount of coverage i 've been using this over a week and it has n't caused my sensitive skin to break out the one thing i do n't like about this foundation is that it sinks into the pores on my nose and breaks apart on the areas of my face that are dry
3	major plus this is amazing on sensitive skin major minus not very effective in hot weather i 've tried and liked products from vichy before and deodorants are high on my list of things i love to try because i have yet to find the perfect one this one would actually have rated higher if i had n't waited for weather above 85 before writing my review it was great on and even in my overly hot back in may but as june got hotter and hotter i found that it just was n't effective for more than a couple of hours on very warm days since the skin in my pits tends to get irritated and can even feel dry at times i would definitely recommend this is an option for folks who have sensitive skin , it is the best i 've used in that regard , my skin feels great !
4	this is one where a little dab will do ya in fact , that 's about all you get with each press of the pump the first time i used it , i thought the pump was defective , but then i realized that that tiny spit of cleanser is all i really need to clean my entire face and neck funny thing is , i would like to be forced to use more a deep down urge that my hand be filled with before other than that , this cleanser works great and at this rate , one bottle will last me forever
5	works well , smells very pleasant
5	i really like this scent or combination of scents it 's a little bit sweet , a little leather and spice , and a refreshing change from most other male fragrances when you put this on your first whiff is of alcohol that vanishes , of course , and what is left is a nicely fragrance by which i mean that it does n't change from what it is when you spray it on to something more flowery later it smelled good after 60 seconds and stayed smelling good for hours which brings up the stench factor i hate scents that are knock you out strong i'm scent sensitive so i and the family need to use perfumes and such in moderation this is very nice lasts well without having to yourself recommend if you are looking for a new male fragrance this is one to definitely try i loved the scent and my husband and the teens did too \( is it \)
4	when it comes to bliss products , i'm on the fence some of them , like their face and body washes , are really nice others , like their toning and cellulite creams are gimmicky and still others like their body lotions and face creams lotions are hit and miss i do love the bliss soapy suds and body butter \( in grapefruit \) and their aloe leaf peppermint foot \( unbelievable after a long day on your feet ! ! ! \) , so i thought i would give this a try i do have sensitive skin , and i have had some reactions to bliss products in the past , but i suppose it 's due to each formulation i always do a patch test first to see if things will go south or not the patch test i did with this did okay , so i liberally applied this to my neck , chest , and the as the directions tell you to the lotion itself is a pretty shade of light pink and it feels soooo silky smooth going on there is a fragrance , but it is very , very light and pretty pleasant you can definitely wear this with perfume and not have it overpower that scent when applied it absorbs pretty quickly and does n't leave behind a greasy feel it also does n't develop a sticky texture as you are applying it , like some lotions do i'm not sure if that 's from the water content in them being absorbed faster than the rest of the ingredients , but i was happy that this lotion did n't do that i 've been using this for a little over a week and am about 1 4 of the way through the jar i'm bummed that it goes so quickly , as this lotion is pricey it moisturizes quite well , but 45 is still a steep price to pay this is one of those times when the product actually feels as expensive as it is one thing to watch out for if you happen to apply this and not wash your hands afterwards , the taste of the lotion can transfer to food even if your hands are dry i applied and went for an apple about 20 minutes later , and my first bite tasted like this lotion yuck i had to brush my teeth and tongue to get the taste to go away as an aside , this would make a great lotion to use when doing monthly because it is so silky and absorbs evenly , it allows your fingers to evenly move across your skin without tugging or sticking , which is important when performing these using a good lotion is a trick my suggested because it makes these easier , and it also keeps that delicate skin moisturized , which is also important some cancer causes the skin to , flake , itch , crack , or turn red and these are also things that can happen with dry skin so it 's very important to keep your chest and breast skin properly cared for
5	this product is great i have very sensitive eyes eye area and have used many other products i like this one the best it is easy to apply non irritant and is not greasy amazing product
3	i like how my skin feels after i apply the cream , there is never any irritation i am not a fan of the smell the perfume reminds me of lavender , which not everybody likes it lacks freshness the dispenser jar is gimmicky you remove the lid , press the top , and the cream is dispensed from a hold in the middle i assume , it is designed this way to avoid oxidation however , unless you are careful to remove all of dispensed cream a thin layer that stays on top of the dispensed still as far as cost goes , it is very expensive , and ingredients look like a bunch of chemicals i see on other beauty products i am not sure which one of them justifies the cost the product mentions something about scientific formation and unexpected discovery , but i suspect it is a bunch of usual marketing
5	works good , got here quickly and in good packaging is really appealing to the eye and works so good !
2	once you 've tried one cologne shower gel , you 've tried them all the scent is strong , but the bubbles are slim no pouf in the world can give you the soapy suds you desire and it never feels like it 's doing any cleaning this is especially true of the burberry gel if you are determined to buy it , i recommend using your usual bar or favorite body wash first so you will actually be clean and then follow up with the burberry so your skin will smell like a 's men 's department for the next thirty minutes admittedly i do love the burberry brit rhythm scent it 's masculine but a step above your typical locker room it 's deep and , but not especially overpowering the gel does not linger on your skin for long , so if you are n't going to follow up with the cologne itself , you better move fast and get someone in bed because otherwise , no one will notice overall i would never recommend any shower gel that is from a cologne line and do not recommend the burberry either they all fail as a cleansing soap , are , and , most surprisingly , the fragrance does n't linger i do like the scent , though , so if you 're shopping around for a new cologne , you might give brit rhythm a sniff to see if it fits your needs
3	i tried these anti aging serums out for over two weeks and i love trying out new skincare products to assist in wrinkle smoothing and to help my skin feel healthy and moisturized and protected there are three tiny bottles including a nourisher which has superfruit stem cell serum per the product description the smoother a powerhouse peptide complex and finally a lifter which is predominantly comprised of vitamin c and hyaluronic acid , the droppers are easy to use and the bottles look cute on my counter but overall i felt that the three step process was a bit much when the results did n't really make a visible difference and there is no sunscreen to help protect from further skin damage while it made my skin feel moisturized it definitely slowed me down as applying three products is time consuming and part of me wondered why they did n't just make one huge bottle with all three serums mixed since you 're layering them on one after another anyway also , olay products are much cheaper than the cost per ounce of this brand and many have needed sunscreen protection
5	excellent coverage without being too cakey you can easily layer with the rest of your face make up products and the finish is still very nice no cracking and just does n't appear too heavy in general it goes on smooth with more of a matte finish applies great with a brush or blender everything still looks great at the end of the day too does n't dry out or irritate fussy skin does n't cause break outs , which is usually a huge problem with foundations tried so many that just caused too many skin problems from dry patches to horrible little pimples all over the chin area etc this one does n't do any of that feels like it still let 's the skin breathe while still having great coverage
5	hands down my favorite tinted moisturizer it 's rich , creamy , applies quickly and evenly it 's not overly shiny , even with the spf i add a dusting of sexy mama translucent powder and i look put together and ready to go the light is perfect for my coloring , and blends out easily it is priced well and the tube lasts a really long time !
2	it is very drying , and that is the only difference i see in my skin texture since using this
5	this is a really nice moisturizer i find it difficult to find moisturizers that are good with oily skin more often than not they 're thin , and smell of rubbing alcohol , and this product is neither it 's a nice consistency \( a light cream , not a thin lotion \) it spreads over the skin easily , and it does n't leave a greasy heavy feeling on my skin it absorbs quickly too i think this is a great product at a very reasonable price \( a little goes a long way ! \) it 's less expensive than the high end moisturizers , but every bit as good updated this version has no spf protection , but they do offer this moisturizer with spf as well , both versions are wonderful
4	i have been in the process of switching to all natural and organic beauty products and needed something to help with occasional breakouts i liked what the juice beauty description had to say so i decided to try it out i like that the serum is thick and stays where you put it i have to say that i was surprised at how moisturizing it was when most blemish creams leave skin dry and peeling the description also says that you can use this kind of like a lotion , but i do n't know if i would like that since it does n't really seem to get absorbed by your skin , just kind of sits on top of it while i like that it has natural and organic ingredients i did n't have such good luck with it treating my blemishes \( which mostly occur at that time of the month \) it did n't really seem to reduce the redness , puffiness , or the longevity like i hoped it would after reading another review that it helped with rosacea , i am going to pass this along to my mother to see if it will help her with that skin problem as for me , i am going to go back to using tea tree oil it 's a lot cheaper , also natural , and seems to work better for me without drying out my skin also good to note i had my sister try this as well and she had similar results she ended up giving it back \( for our mother to try \) and went back to using burt 's bees herbal blemish stick which she likes \( and also contains tea tree oil \)
5	butter london has got to be one of my favorite brands of nail polish and being able to get this at a discounted price thanks to the marketplace made this nail polish even better if you 're going to splurge on anything , splurge on this \(
4	it has a weird smell during application that may bother smell sensitive people , but it does not last and it works as an all day moisturizer using this in the shower keeps me from needing to also slather on lotion it 's really great for dry skin and will become a regular staple in the bathroom , especially during the winter months
5	this really works for me it goes on like a lotion , and at first it looks shiny , like a lotion in about a minute , i start to notice that the skin is looking more matt , and in the next few , it 's like my pores disappear where i apply it now , i have fairly small pores anyway , so i 've been using it where mine are the most noticeable and where my skin is the on my nose , chin , and that little triangle between my eyes and forehead i have great results i have used it with and without the bioderma cleanser that is recommended it be used with it works either way for me , so this is a fine stand alone product i have used other products but they felt slick and silk , and like they had a ton of silicone in them this does n't change the feel of my , and it works well under makeup this is my favorite pore minimizing product ever it does not leave my skin feeling dried out in the least , either it does need to be applied 2 3 times a day the tube is small enough to fit in any pure and it 's fairly thin too , so it would n't take up much room in a makeup bag i ca n't say if it will work for people with pronounced , but on my small to average sized pores , it 's very effective it does n't have an odor
5	extremely nice cleaner i do n't have heavy acne , but i do get occasional areas that come and go after using this cleanser , i noticed all my acne getting much and better it does n't completely prevent an occasional one here and there , but for the most part , it keeps most of the outbreaks it 's perfect for my neck , where i 've been having acne since getting much older feels nice and clean , and does n't burn my skin
3	i have been using topical c serums for years , and thought i would try the citrix product as any topical c fan knows , there are a ton of products out there , and it is n't that hard to your own mix you can buy a lifetime supply of ascorbic acid for under 10 \( but might your skin in the process \) many affordable c products on amazon have artificially inflated reviews buyer beware ! i'm a big fan of for this reason now to the citrix if you check the ingredients , you 'll see a lot of skin conditioners and silicones at the top of the list a vitamin c does not appear until fourth place the serum itself is watery , with a slight orange fragrance , possibly from the citrus , a substance more frequently found in cleaning products i have had neither a positive nor a negative reaction to the serum , but then , i have pretty tough skin and i'm used to c serum i usually use serums that are 15 20 c citrix does not list a percentage , and i suspect it 's very low , maybe 5 i'm not sure what pro collagen means either , as there are n't a lot of the usual collagen stimulating ingredients in the mix i 've been using the gold standard c serum , which costs more than its weight in gold , so would welcome a more affordable alternative there are some decent c products out there the , many at better price points than this one so i am not tempted to switch , but will continue to use for a few more weeks to see if anything changes
5	always use after i wash my hair leaves my hair smelling wonderful and shiny also helps with styling my hair as well
4	the great thing about this pencil is its thin fine point as someone who my eyebrows to the point of non , i have become at filling my eyebrows in most products out there are either powders that wear off quickly or thicker point pencils that create an artificial brow line i played around with this pencil for an hour and got the hang of proper application which involved short precise strokes that mimic fine hairs as i continued to experiment i achieved a brow line that works for me and compliments my dark blonde hair the pencil application works all day and is easily removed with my facial cleanser i liked this product and think it is one of the better eyebrow products i 've tried a little goes a long way
5	great color i love all cnd products
3	i love the feel of this eyeshadow crayon it glides right on and goes on evenly the color is a little dark for regular day wear but that s okay because the first time you rub at your eyes it 's gone i tried several different of my morning routine to try to make it last at least 3 5 hours , to no avail i put a primer on first , i tried it with no primer , i tried it on dry moisturized skin , i used it as a primer for a lighter eyeshadow , i tried over it to set it nothing i tried so far has managed to make this last through my lunch break which is unfortunate because i like the creamy feel , the color , and the ease of application but none of that does me any good if it all ends up under my eyes instead of above them
5	this is a great home facial beauty device typically , i have been going to spas at least twice a month for and facials , spending about 75 for each treatment i have now decreased my spa visits to only once monthly using this foreo luna cleansing massage tool twice a day \( morning and evening \) stimulating the collagen in my skin , i honestly see the benefits of long time use of a product like this i love that i can use this in the of my own home to keep my skin glowing , clean and youthful looking i am so glad i found this product and it will be a staple in my beauty regimen from now on
3	as i mentioned in my review of calvin klein eternity aqua , i mentioned my love of calvin klein euphoria and that is what me to choose both eternity aqua and obsession calvin klein obsession has been around longer than either eternity aqua and euphoria since the mid 1980 's it is a guy 's scent , but neither my sister nor i are opposed to occasionally wearing men 's scents it 's nice not to have all those sweet florals all the time so for this review , i had my sister help me quite a bit , as she was the primary wearer of the perfume my sister first noticed that it was a long lasting scent that really retained its original smell for almost the entire duration of the perfume she could smell it several hours after application and not perceive any significant fading later the smell itself was a different story she thought it smelled cheap it was a pretty straight forward simple scent primarily composed of musk with very few other notes she could detect it was not a terrible smell to wear , but it just did n't stand out very much nor did it really with her personality and what she likes in a perfume she would not be opposed to wearing it or potentially buying it , but she indicated she would not spend full price on it while i did n't wear obsession to the extent of my sister , i found much of her comments to be the same for me the scent was nice , but it did not stand out you did n't go , that person is wearing such an expensive , distinct scent ! instead , it smelled like a generic men 's cologne pleasant , cinnamon y and musky , but nothing noteworthy i suppose this could be because of its age that so much time has gone by , everyone has tried to obsession brought to you by c s light
5	used for years and for me the best foundation very smooth and nice finish
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	i used nia24 intensive recovery complex every morning and night for the past six weeks it 's easy to open the small jar and get just the right amount for use it goes on very silky smooth and is comfortable to wear it absorbs into the skin right away and does n't feel greasy my skin does feel hydrated and soft i have n't noticed any difference to the fine wrinkles near my eyes or on my forehead i also have n't noticed any skin brightening
5	amazing cleanser cannot recommend to enough people it 's great
5	to be honest , i really did n't think this would work but i 've been using it a while and i can tell a difference i have some tiny wrinkles around my mouth that are real obvious when i laugh and since i 've been using this , i notice they are slowly getting less obvious i'm really pleased with this stuff !
4	went to get my nails done and chose this color i love it so many people have asked me about who made it i would have given it a 5 star rating but sometimes , you 'll need 3 coats instead of 2 to get the true color
5	holy smokes ! this very well might be my new favorite essie color ! ! ! literally the most gorgeous shade of blue ever ! and you really only need one coat to get total coverage just plain beautiful and i 've received so many complements on it it just pops !
3	the finish is very matte so you definitely need a clear coat \( i use sally hansen quick dry \) the color is nice though
5	color is beautiful and as stated in description i have been looking for this type of blue polish for the longest time the polish goes on smoothly great quality !
2	this serum promises to clear blemishes , hydrate , and reduce redness inflammation according to the directions , you apply it to your whole face or just the blemishes after cleanser but before moisturizer i was n't sure how to apply it with a dropper , so i just applied a few drops to a cotton ball and wiped it on while the bottle is tiny , you do n't need much serum for each application \( at least if you yourself to the actual blemishes \) i 've been applying this product for a week and it has made no change the few blemishes i have were as red as always and seem to be going away at the same rate they would without acne medication i have , at least , seen no negative results this works for other people , but i have seen no results
5	i am a man who will soon be turning fifty three during the past year , my skin has become dry , irritated and red to my , i had to stop using an electric shaver this helped but i still had some patches of dry skin in areas where i did n't shave , primarily around my left eyebrow in order to relieve the situation , i had to shave every other day and only wash my face in the morning and never at night every morning , i used an exfoliator that was designed to be gentle \( nivea men sensitive face wash \) still , i had to use a lot of cetaphil in order to relieve my dry skin when the amazon vine program offered me the mario badescu seaweed cleansing soap , i jumped at the opportunity to try it it has noticeably improved the feel and texture of my skin i have returned to shaving every day and to washing my face twice a day , once in the morning and once at night before going to bed in fact , i feel confident that i could wash it more often as needed i squeeze a tiny smear of the greenish , cream onto the palm of my left hand and use my right fingers to smear it onto my face i gently rub it into my skin the seaweed cleansing soap has a pleasant smell that is barely noticeable it is not strong and abrasive like liquid aftershave the soap is easily washed off it does not sting my flesh like some exfoliators have done my skin is left feeling moist , not dry and irritated according to the packaging , this soap is designed for all skin types the plastic bottles appearance is neither feminine nor masculine it is what i call gender friendly however , there was n't any safety seal beneath the old fashioned screw on cap it is difficult to rub a small amount into the palm of my hand it would have been better if the cap had a spout that lies flat with the top of the bottle you lift up the spout and squeeze out a small dollop of the cream overall , i really like the seaweed cleansing soap from mario badescu skincare it thoroughly cleans my skin , giving it a healthy glow , without dehydrating it i the creamy texture , color and scent of the cleanser it easily washes off my face the bottle is small enough to carry in a backpack , purse , shoulder bag , tote bag , etc therefore , it is conducive for traveling after using the product for nearly a week , i have n't experienced any adverse side effects i highly recommend this seaweed cleansing soap it would make a thoughtful present for someone with a troubled complexion
4	this is a luxury sun lotion to enjoy the sun and get a tan in a healthy manner this is not a sunscreen for swimming or water activities or if you are in a humid location where you will sweat , you are supposed s sunscreen made for wetness additionally then it contains the mentioned ingredients , is not greasy , easy to apply and good on skin i do feel cost is bit high and if can be brought down , it will make the product more appealing
5	i love this perfume ! the reviews do n't lie it really is a lovely , floral sent that is n't overpowering a lot of perfumes that i 've used fade too quickly and do n't leave a lasting smell until the end of the day , but this perfume really does a lovely job it 's just strong enough to be able to smell it , but no so strong that you get sick of it or leave a trail letting everybody know somebody with too much perfume just in i 've always enjoyed calvin klein perfumes and this one is no exception considering how long these last , i think it 's definitely worth the price !
2	i absolutely love applying eye shadow i like to think of my eyelids as a blank canvas where i can express my so when i had the chance to try this product , i jumped at it with that being said , i have to say i am rather disappointed there is very little pigmentation and the colors are matte which makes it appear dull moreover , not that it is a deal breaker for me , but buyers need to know that applicators are not included so if you do purchase this product be sure you have your own applicator
3	i 've tried a few different types of vitamin c serums in the past several years i believe in c serums and my skin is the type that benefits i have oily skin wish i did n't here are my points on this serum a \) the dropper is what it should be works perfectly because the angle at the end makes it so b \) the other c serums i tried were 20 and i feel that i got faster and bigger results than this 10 one i am the c percentage matters based on this experience c \) some c serums come with hyaluronic acid as an ingredient , and one that i tried earlier that had both c and hyaluronic acid got me the best results d \) the added fragrance is good , i think normally i do n't like anything with added fragrance but it 's just the smallest touch and it makes me feel more confident in the product somehow i liked it
5	i have used this product , along with other hair , for several years now i swear by it the colors are very close and blend very well
5	first time with this product but long time user of this brand already seeing an improvement
5	great for oily skin does n't make your face shiny when you apply makeup on top of it
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	this is a decent eyes shadow duo if you like a light color or a natural look the colors are very natural , however i like a more bright and bold color that makes my eyes stand out other than that if you are looking for a nice sepia , this would fit the bill !
5	this is becoming my favorite color looks great
5	i love everything shellac , this is a bright red i get compliments when i wear it fun color to wear !
5	great product long wear i have many colors
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
2	this color was a much darker purple than i was expecting unless it is in bright sunlight , it looks quite dark the color on my computer monitor looks like a bright vibrant purple i was disappointed
1	see description above the london butter nail lacquer that i purchased from their company is 100 fantastic ! ! but , the london butter nail lacquer that i purchased from shop adorn was disgusting ! !
5	this stuff is great ! smells yummy and makes your lips smooth it 's the best lip scrub i have found !
5	great product expensive but worth it !
5	loved this nail polish ! such a pretty purple grey color not shimmery at all and looks awesome on my nails is not too thin and streaky but is not too thick either i love essie colors , especially purple and will continue buying them !
4	this is a very nice hand cream it leaves my hands soft without feeling greasy , which is important for me i wash a re apply hand cream throughout the day and this works very well the only problem is that it has a scent that lingers and , as i wear a particular perfume daily , it competes with the perfume too much
4	the first thing i noticed about this was that the bottle seems poorly designed for a lotion , it was a little awkward and it seems that a tube or pump would suit something of this consistency better that said , it still gets the job done so not a huge deal when first applied i felt a slight tingling warming sensation especially on the more sensitive areas of my face i thought it felt nice and never got intense enough to be uncomfortable after giving it time to soak in it left my skin feeling moisturized and smooth and never greasy like some other aftershave lotions i have tried i found the scent to be pleasant and not overpowering , but i do not traditionally wear cologne and it might be a bit much if combined with something else
5	im so glad to find this ! it covers my spots of thin hair by shading the scalp give it a try
5	i like this shade of green can't wait to use it
3	i followed instructions to the letter application is easy , you do n't need to use a lot left on my face for 10 minutes and did n't notice any tingling or redness did n't see much of anything happening scent was mild , i did n't notice it lingering i think it is pricey and perhaps you have to use it over a longer period of time to see any sort of results i'm thinking , no big deal there are other peels out there you might want to try that do n't cost quite so much
5	this unscented , thick cream provides instant soothing to dry and irritated skin i'm using it after hand washing in colder months when my skin is dry the tube size is perfect for popping in your purse or car my boyfriend uses it too since there 's no girly scent to prevent him
3	i was excited to try this mascara , but i was n't too thrilled with the product the application of the mascara was great it went on smooth and initially looked very nice , but it started to clump almost immediately ! i spent literally fifteen minutes trying to fix the clumpy mess that resulted i also notice that this mascara was very flaky flakes were falling all over my face , causing me to have to re do part of my makeup on the plus side the applicator is a great size \( not too big , not too small \) , it has a pleasant smell , and the packaging is pretty personally , i 'll stick to my 7 covergirl mascara any day before i would purchase this product again
5	this skin care line dramatically changed my skin ! i use this twice a day and it never dries out my skin ! its so refreshing and makes my pores feel so clean ! for the price i would recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne , or oily skin !
2	it 's hard to give an objective review when i 've only been able to use this about five times before the tip wore down rendering it unusable as i need very thin , soft strokes which a cannot give there was no sharpener in the package i received i tried using other brow pencil sharpeners but none worked \( they only wore down the tip \) the lack of proper sharpener may have affected application but not the other elements \( texture , color , look when applied , price value ratio \) that are a part of evaluating this pencil 's effectiveness i 've used a wide variety of eyebrow pencils over the years at a variety of price points the best are easy to apply in that they do n't seem to cake or clump and go on evenly \( with a well sharpened tip \) and do n't smudge you can shape the tip as needed to give thicker or thinner lines the consistency \( a bit waxy but not too much \) , which you ca n't try before you buy , is a key factor in both application and longevity , once applied other than the color itself , there 's nothing that i liked about this product which is disappointing as this is a good brand and i 've used other longo products and been satisfied with their performance it 's especially disappointing given the price point application not as easy as other pencils , which is due , in part , i think , to the consistency \( waxy , clumpy \) and the size of the tip \( too small and and not thin enough to my liking \) texture not as smooth as other pencils i 've used took longer to apply and had to keep smudging and fiddling with q tips to get a neat line did n't go on evenly look when applied seemed heavier and line was not as strong and consistent getting a thin line was very difficult \( again , an issue of consistency and size shape of product tip \) color this was a really good color for me , even though i have medium brown hair i have found that many products labeled blonde are the right shade either alone or when used to lighten up a darker color price value simply not there for me i 've had better application , better looking brows with pencils that were cheaper but since a person 's brows \( color , texture , etc \) differ greatly , this may work better for you than me i have thin ish brows and need thin , really feathery lines , which this could not deliver
5	i'm 66 and i have never been able to keep polish on this works just remember , it stays stick untill you are finished and clean your nails with alcohol
4	the problem with skin care products is that the test is not very scientific i cannot compare what would have happened if i had n't been using the product having said this and admitting that my review is based on observation and remembered comparisons , i think that the nia 24 treatment does make a difference i 've been using it for a little over three weeks and i have n't been consistent in the method of use because the instructions are a bit vague it says to use a couple of drops and you can use them either after applying your usual face lotion to your skin or mixing it with your lotion before applying with the first method , two drops do n't cover my whole face and neck for the second method i did n't know what the ratio of cream to treatment was supposed to be no amount is specified , so it was trial and error for me what i 've finally settled on \( and it appears to be working \) is to take a tiny bowl \( one of those tiny things you use in the kitchen to pre measure spices for a recipe \) squeeze a bit more than a teaspoon of my usual face cream into it , add 3 drops of the nia 24 , and it together this is enough for face , neck , and the top of my hands if i have any left over in the little bowl , i simply cover it and apply it to my hands later \( i arrived at 3 drops after noticing what 2 drops covered in the first method \) my observations are that my face and neck do appear to feel softer and more hydrated \( should i say nourished \? \) after two weeks of using it this way and the cream absorbs just as well i ca n't really say how much of this improvement is due to the treatment and how much is due to the fact that , since i take my job as reviewer seriously , i was being a lot more diligent in applying my moisturizer i can speak with more confidence about my hands , though i know that this is n't the intended use of the treatment , but i was getting very self conscious about how old and dry my hands were looking i looked at my hands more times everyday than i looked at my face , so i am more certain that i can testify that a noticeable improvement has occurred they no longer have that old look i'm not saying they look young but they do look respectable and , now , when i look at them , i no longer cringe
5	i find that if i keep sunscreen handy in my bag , the car , and by the front door , not just in the bathroom i remember to use it more often this is a handy size and attractive package the sunscreen itself has no discernible odor , so you wo n't smell like a tropical cocktail all in all , a good product
5	it 's a food product and i like it
5	loved it everything was easy thank you ! ! will shop again because it was so easy to do and the producta are great love that it comwes right to my house so simple , thank you , i will be buying more colors again
2	like many women i am in search of the face product that will give me lovely skin i'm sure my expectations are out of whack with reality , but i'm also sure i will get the same non result from a gentle soap and water i would not waste money on this
4	really pretty color , but not good for a yellower skin tone gave it to my mom who is more of a pink skin tone very blue undertones
5	i use just a little bit of this on my hair before blowdrying it really does make my hair thicker and i need to use a lot less hair fibers which is good now , the hair spray adds no extra value i just use a cheap spray from the drug store
4	i like the color
5	i was happy to receive this product from jouer to review i am older now so i do n't like to use a lot of makeup but that old saying , a little dab will do you , definitely helps i applied a small amount to my face and i was surprised at how it added just the right color to give my face a brighter , healthier look i then applied a small amount to my lips , both times it went on smooth , and easy i used my finger to apply and that worked well i really liked how it looked on the lips i think sometimes too much lipstick on an older woman does n't look good , but this was just a touch of color that gave a healthy look all in all a nice product , one that you can control the amount used simple and quick to apply , and will definitely give you a warm glow
1	see description above the london butter nail lacquer that i purchased from their company is 100 fantastic ! ! but , the london butter nail lacquer that i purchased from shop adorn was disgusting ! !
2	love essie , however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly only was able to use it twice not to happy
3	burberry the beat eau de toilette is a scent that has a lot going on this complicated scent was launched in 2008 by , and the beat has top warm notes of bergamot , cardamom , pink pepper and mandarin these very spicy top notes stay quite predominant and give the scent a very masculine intensity the middle heart notes contain tea , iris and creating a light floral fragrance the bottom notes of white musk , vetiver and cedar wood give the scent a very sensual fragrance , yet quite masculine with it 's very animal and woodsy aromas this is a scent that many burberry parfum fans felt had too many hands in it 's creation created by two men and one woman may be the reason there are so many masculine top and bottom notes and a very light middle of feminine floral scents this is definitely one scent you should try on before buying it , if you are not certain how the stronger spices , wood and musk scents will mix with your own body chemistry i worked in a cosmetic factory for over half a decade and i know this is a very sex scent that someone like me who prefers a more feminine aroma will not like if you are familiar with burberry brit , this scent is very similar without the lime citrus notes it is also quite similar to dkny pure for myself , i like light medium oriental floral made in paris scents chanel no 5 , chanel no 5 eau , and boucheron are some of my very favorites if you like the same scents i do , you may not like the added masculinity notes of the beat for those who like a more complicated clean smelling sex scent , you will like the beat this scent is made in paris and is packaged in a checked pattern bottle with a little metal and leather hang tag around the neck even though the beat is not my type of perfume with it 's masculine top and bottom notes , this 3 1 2 star scent is overall nice and light with it 's clean and crisp smell , with only one drawback and that is it does n't last a full 8 hour day you will need to touch up after a half a day , as it is light and does fade
3	ok , i'm 57 years old maybe this foundation is for younger women that said , i had higher hopes for it it is illuminating , but with sparkles , which i did n't want \( thought they were not noticeable on my face , i saw them on my forearms , where i had checked the color \) and not anywhere near enough coverage for my blotchy spots and considering how thin the product is , it did stick on dry areas more than expected but not more so than some \( especially drugstore \) foundations the color was nice for my fair , but not pale , neutral \( but on the cool side \) coloring about the scent , it seemed off or something do n't know why that is , but i was a little concerned will be returning still , i can see that this may be a great foundation for other skin and age types , and maybe the off smell was a fluke for this particular order
1	aweful coverage , like mud on my face
3	was a little shocked to open up the package and find this inside seemed super small and quite expensive for what you get and the size i know this is a luxury type of brand so if you 're willing to pay that for a small container of a blush like product than you may like it if you get the right shade the petal color is akin to a flushed type of look , not bad , looks good , works well but not sure if this shade will blend with all skin tones good points it 's easy to apply you can use your fingertips and apply on cheeks as a blush or lips for a flush of color so it 's versatile plus it 's loaded with vitamin e and shea butter to nourish and moisturize the skin it 's paraben free as well if you buy this you can also custom build your jouer palette by attaching compacts side to side and lining up tracks that slide together or simply the pegs back to back and slide together to expand the palette , which i find to be a unique feature my opinion is you 'd get a better value with the whole palette \( which is also expensive \) but contains a lot more of a diverse mix of products and a lot more of the product \( s \) for the money overall , it 's a nice brand but i 'd give this alone three stars and go for the palette with everything included instead
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	a few things you need to know to begin this is a thin aftershave lotion , not a liquid the top screws on and off and you squeeze the balm out rather than tipping or shaking it now to the good stuff it smells incredible ! burberry is of putting out a mediocre scent but this time they formulated a great one it 's something between fresh , clean and woodsy and since it 's in a balm it can either be left alone and left as the hint of scent or layered on with more product for something stronger the guy of the house loved this but , honestly \? i stole it from him and swab a little near my pulse points when i do n't feel like using my own scent it smells good !
5	great cleaner you can use every day make my skin very soft
4	i really tried to match my skin tone with the swatch but it ended up not even close color aside the coverage is excellent i have a deep acne scar on my back it is very different in color from my normal skin tone this product completely flattened out the discoloration if it had been a good color match , this would have met my needs 100 i 'd have to see the colors in person to make a better match i was way off
5	love the color and i will definitely purchase it again
4	this is a great brush head set which includes sensitive brush head , deep pore brush head , radiance brush head , and 1 luxe cashmere cleanse brush head for extra dry skin my skin runs oily but i like all 4 of these brushes sensitive normal to combination deep pore refining flush away impurities to minimize pore size radiance gentle care luxe cashmere gentlest brush out there this is a good combo of brushes that range from super gentle \( luxe \) to more invigorating \( deep pore \) it 's a good kit for beginner clarisonic users too so that they can figure out which brush works best for them or , you can use it like i use it as an year round brush kit i use the gentlest brush in the winter , and the deep pore in the summer
5	love all his products but this feels so good on your face , leaving it nice and smooth and refreshed
4	this shower oil may sound a little strange i have used some products marketed as such which just left a greasy residue on my skin this is a little different because it when it comes in contact with water and gets sort of creamy after applying and adding i thought this was a nice moisturizing product that restored moisture to the skin 's surface and left my skin with a soft glowing patina that looked far nicer than dry skin with a look that one of my this product has a nice scent which is n't too much and it left my skin feeling better after a day at the beach i have used another product that works in similar fashion that is less expensive , yet this is also equally nice my only advice is that the shower got a little slippery when in use so a rubber bath mat might be needed
4	i have very dry skin and wrinkles how could i not accept the offer to try juice beauty green apple age defy moisturizer \? i gave this one 3 stars out of the box , because no animal testing is done star 4 was because it has natural products and no heavy fragrance also , it moisturizes i began using it the morning it arrived and have been using it morning and night for several days here is what i think no product on the planet really makes wrinkles there are a lot of products out there and some disappoint me because i find out that they use animal testing in the production of the product not necessary in my particular case , i am sensitive to all sorts of environmental chemicals and drugs , so i like to stay as natural as possible with all of the products that i use in my home and on my person this product feels light to the touch and absorbs quickly into the skin with no greasy feel to it i am able to apply make up immediately , with no wait time nothing makes wrinkles go away , but this does soften the skin and does away with flakiness i would like to say that i will certainly buy this product again , but the price is a little high for my budget what i will say is that i would like to be able to do so , and in fact would love to try their entire product line
2	expensive and dries my skin out i had higher expectations for the product at this price
4	this makeup brush is long , 6 5 inches , and just fits in my makeup kit the bristles are soft , rounded and open , not dense the brush picks up blush lightly for shading i like the ergonomic handle it 's a wide grip made from silicon like material that is and comfortable in the hand the only thing i would say is that you need to have powder in a good sized compact , because the brush is wide , an inch across , and tapered , so that you 'll only pick up powder at the tip if you have a small compact
1	i gave this one star because the st that i bought was garbage and this mitt just spread around bad product better off going for a spray tan
1	to be fair this is a nice soap , but for 22 \? i received this as a gift and liked it well enough , but when i saw the price i knew i 'd never purchase it for myself it was really no better or worse than cheaper soap
4	very good makeup remover and cleanser even when i do n't wear makeup , i can really tell how much gunk this stuff takes off just from looking at the cotton ball but like a few people noted , i could n't just let my skin air dry after using this and had to rinse with water to get a clean feeling
4	i got this for my partner because it has her colors in it she has been very happy with the way the product work and would give it five stars except for the packaging the best thing , besides the color is that there is a built in mirror in the reflective material of the lid both the top and bottom work as great mirrors the mirror in the inside is , the mirror on the outside unfortunately almost instantly finger and looks messy quickly the other big issue with this compact is that it does not come with an applicator nor does it have a place to store one if you had an extra to put with it so that makes me wonder if the built in mirror that is brilliant is meant for use , or if the lack of an applicator means it should be used in a location where applicators would be available it does n't seem to fit either perfectly as for the product my partner immediately put it on and we went out to eat and she looked great as we left as well as after we returned the product seem great
4	the thick finishing spray volume spray is good , but the lingering mist is a bit much love products but this is not my favorite , only because of the heavy mist left it gets all over everything and it leaves a in the air for a bit
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	steel soap really does n't sound very useful but apparently due to chemistry and stuff , something about molecules binding , steel removes certain strong scents such as onion and garlic it feels odd rubbing your hands on a bar of metal , but who can argue with results \? this bar is really useful while cooking you are constantly washing your hands , but do n't want to use soap since then it gets all over the food \( especially scent \) it works with well with removing food scents , but i was especially happy when it removed the old sponge smell from my hands i really hate that smell and can generally only cover it up with scented soap in addition to working , this bar is actually really cute looking it is smaller than i expected , fitting comfortably in the palm of my hand i like the shape as well it looks very elegant
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	purchased suntan from nordstrom and it 's finally my match ! i'm glad i did n't give up finding the perfect color because i love the natural look it gives me
2	i with how to rate the meg21 eye treatment the information from the company states that results should be visible in four weeks or less to fairly evaluate meg21 i used it exclusively for 32 consecutive days i stopped using my usual eye treatment , replacing it with meg21 however , i continued the rest of my normal routine the advertising for this product , as well as , many of the reviews speak of incredible , visible results unfortunately , i did not have a similar experience from the beginning the packaging is nice i really like the pump dispenser , it was easy to open , did not clog and can be locked back into place this is especially helpful for those that travel and or those who have small children at home \( many a cream has been dispensed onto my counter and floor i wish all products had a locking cap like this one \) the cream itself is thin , very silky to the touch , with a barely noticeable scent it goes on smoothly and dries quickly this product did not cause any type of irritation or tearing of the eyes \( i mention this because it has happened with two other eye creams in the past \) the highlight effect in meg21 is almost overdone if you have bags under your eyes , even small ones , this cream highlights those making them even more noticeable i used this eye treatment daily and there 's been no softening of lines , tightening of the skin or reduction in puffiness even the over eye skin shows no improvement i expected the over eye skin to at least some level of moisturizing benefit but , i was wrong meg21 has an enticing advertising pitch and a well packaged product unfortunately that 's all this product is overpriced and failed to deliver any of the benefits for which it was intended for these reasons i cannot , in good conscience recommend meg21 to others
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	for me , the day life color pallet works awesome normally when i use an eye shadow , even using just a small swipe of it on my skin makes the colors so bold it looks like i 've colored my face with crayon i'm just so fair skinned that anything but the lightest colors look too bright on me but these eye shadows seem to go on in layers , so you can get just a bit of color , and then intensify it as needed with this set \( day life \) , i'm able to apply the browns , greys and golds and they show up on my skin just right my teen daughter who has more of a medium skin tone needs to apply most of the eye shadow colors a few times to get the color to her liking so if you 're fair skinned like myself , this set might work well for you the day life pallet has soft colors that look so nice on lots of neutral shades , light colored blushes and shiny glosses i love how i can add just a touch of color without looking over done up they 're nice combinations and work well together the makeup comes in a huge plastic case that looks like an oversized pressed powder compact each of the circles of makeup can be removed and placed into the travel compact which is quite a bit smaller and has a built in mirror beside each of the circle color there is a small groove in the case so you can get something small inside like a pin and lift each pallet out , without damaging them i'm enjoying using this set so much that come summer i want to get the beach lift set as well
5	i forgot my toothpaste at a friends , so i borrowed their 's \( which was this \) and was so impressed this actually , polished , and deep cleaned my teeth all in 2 minutes my teeth felt so clean , similar to after the dentist , and they were noticeably whiter and so very impressed and will continue to purchase again
4	great color but the brush is very tinny the color is beautiful but is does not last at all
5	i have been using the neck bust cream now for several months i was introduced to it like most other users on a cruise this facial cream is great i live in florida at 62 i can still get oily skin in this climate this products is light is not clogging my pores
4	this cotton candy color , is kinda light , for my light to medium , olive type skin it shows , but not much , i like blush alot , so this is mild i like a darker and more sparkle , mineral blush i use better , but this is nice blush i choose too light , but ca n't seem to see a one that is fairly colorful ! oh well love quality
4	i do n't wear a lot of makeup and the makeup that i do wear is often pretty natural looking you know , items that make my complexion look a little bit brighter without looking fake i was super happy that this set from jouer easily fit into my makeup wearing lifestyle the colors are pretty toned down , really working to brighten my complexion instead of completely change the color of i felt younger and fresher all day when i started wearing these products i'm also not a big lip product person , but the jouer gloss is my idea of perfection ! it goes on smoothly , does n't make me look like a little kid , and does n't feel sticky and icky it 's great for just throwing in your purse for fix ups on the go i found myself wanting two sets for exactly this reason of course , it is a bit pricey , but definitely goes further than drugstore makeup and to me , is worth it
5	i love the fact that this can be used as a mask and as a night cream i use it both ways and it 's wonderful oh , and the jar , which is a hefty 2 54 oz , lasts me around three months !
5	like all opi , this has a great formula and goes on smoothly in two coats this is a very bubblegum pink color i have a giant stash of 200 opi colors but i could n't find one that was an exact dupe
5	this lip pencil is very rich and pigmented , which reminds me of the nars ones it does n't dry out my skin it does not flake it glides on easily and i love the two colors one is like peachy pink the other is like wine color both are versatile and elegant
5	vichy bb cream is light and stays on very nicely this bb is also very moisturizing and the spf rating of 25 is pretty high for a bb cream this is probably better for lighter to medium skin tones , but it 's very thin so it may not matter too much if you 're looking for a thicker cream with more concealing power though , you 'll be disappointed try something else in that case
3	wonderful iron , heats up quickly , but i found i needed a 1 1 4 rather than a 1 1 2 great quality iron for a reasonable price will be returning for a 1 1 4 amazon has wonderful customer service so i know this will not be an issue
5	i 've become pretty skeptical about well packaged creams like this one too often , they do n't work well , or they irritate sensitive skin , or they are cheap lotions in good looking , expensive bottles or combinations of all that this one surprised me , in a good way it is n't greasy , it does n't have a scent , either fruity or chemical , and it does n't trigger my allergies there is some chemical or preservative commonly used in hand lotions that i'm so allergic to it makes my hands puff up like mitts because of this , i'm cautious when trying new ones i'm pleased to say that this turned out to be safe , and i can still make a best of all , i found it to be very soothing , almost like a thick water , but not slippery like glycerin the consistency is just perfect for this kind of product , and it is enjoyable to use i like it so much i'm planning to buy a second one to keep in my dopp kit for travel i think it would be great at the end of the day for sun and wind burn i'm careful about what takes up space in that kit , but this one earned it recommended sean logue , 2017
5	when my wife first applied this , we both thought is was far too string however , after a few minutes it seemed to settle down and really is an interesting scent there are notes of vanilla and nutmeg in it , as well as some other spicy notes it is definitely not a flowery sort of perfume it is subtle and seems to change over time it is not something you have smelled before
4	it is fine mascara nothing too different about it
2	it was n't too oily and my skin did not break out so that 's good however , i saw no noticeable change in my skin whatsoever
4	i love the coverage of these products and the spf this comes with a small mirror built into the case , as well as a application sponge a little goes along way and if you have multiple shades you can really get a natural look i have multiple shades of this makeup , while suede is a bit dark for my face , i have been using it to blend color to my legs for summer i really like this line of product
5	my tan complection filipina wife loves dermablend she has many different tones on her face and body , so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color it turns out fantastic the way she does it i wish i could put a video up of her before , applying and after i 've never seen any of her make ups come out so well plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker \( yes she gets darker with sun exposure \) she 's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months we have no idea if it 's something in the ingredients of something she eats here , or some sort of spray on the vegetables but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products she has 5 different creams , a couple of powders and 2 sticks , varying shades of tan she can apply them very quickly now , but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such i'm pleased that dermablend is available for people like her , though it 's a little expensive for the amount you get \( my frugal opinion \) she 's worth it ! afternote i asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they do n't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion youtube tutorials
3	the blonde color was darker than i expected , and did not last the brush is nice , the product is over priced , and the packaging is ridiculously hard to open
3	just another red
5	curling irons are a dime a dozen , there are so many , but it is very hard to find a good one , this one is a great one and does a great job keeping my hair in perfect curls
5	love this color , it 's a fun neutral
4	this is creamy and spreads easily with my fingers i ca n't quite figure out the top , though it is shaped like a lip protector tube , but it 's hard to squeeze out the amount you need using the applicator i just wiped it off with my finger and applied it covered my spots pretty well and disappeared enough so it did n't look like i was wearing it i got the fair neutral cool and have medium fair skin , but lots of sun spots and a red nose this product was just right for covering the majority of my maturity marks as my dermatologist calls them
5	i have used this eye cream for 4 years now and i am very happy with it it does a good job of smoothing fine lines and absorbs well i also have sensitive eyes and this product does not bother them i highly recommend the pca line
4	i have sensitive skin that can react poorly to new products , but this foundation did n't irritate my skin at all it 's a unique formulation that starts off as a powder , but that blends into a creamy finish at the age of almost 45 , i have fine lines and occasional dry patches from my nightly use of retin a , so i usually stay away from powder foundations because they tend to those dry areas this bliss foundation , though , goes on creamy , and feels more like a liquid it also has some versatility with its level of coverage you can apply it with the included sponge for more opaque coverage , or with a foundation brush for a finish it can also be applied the same ways either wet or dry the compact this comes in is also sturdy , but does get fingerprints easily it seems like it would hold up well if you take your foundation on the go i really like this foundation , but my reason for knocking off a star is that it is extremely hard to figure out what color to get based on the information that is available about this product online i ordered this from the vine program in natural , but it 's too dark for my fair skin before ordering it , i had searched the bliss website and another online retailer , as well as a few makeup sites , to see if i could out more info about the colors , but i could n't easily locate the information some color swatches would be really helpful , and i 'd recommend trying to locate this in person before ordering it to make sure you get the correct color
1	the reviews on this page seem to be for car window , but my review is for the karuna single hydrating face mask pictured in the i did n't like this mask for the following reasons it makes a mess the mask is so saturated that it drips all over the place i had to keep a facial tissue handy to clean my neck as the solution dripped down fragrance is listed as an added ingredient i thought the scent was too strong for something that is supposed to be used on my face for 10 20 minutes i have dry sensitive skin consequently , some patches on my face were irritated by the fragrance it actually burned a little if you have dry skin i would skip this mask i found the packaging to be a bit wasteful i think getting a facial mask in a jar would last longer and the packaging can be recycled
5	my wife tried this and loves it this is one of my absolute favorite obagi products ! its a cream based product that goes on like a moisturizer but it exfoliates the skin and brings forth smooth , new skin it does have a slight burning feeling at first \( like all good exfoliating products do \) , but its light enough to use every day i use it at night , but you can use it twice daily i noticed a difference in my skin within a week like the obagi moisturizers , a little product goes a long way , so this bottle should last a couple of months at the rate im using it great product !
5	excellent but also cost effective compare the price per ounce to other drugstore makeup removers and you might be pleasantly surprised and you can use it for both eyes and face total win
5	lasts wears a bit longer than opi nail polish
5	my salon uses essie products and they work well on my thin , dry nails i bought several colors
4	i love it
5	a lot of men 's fragrances can be , to say the least , a bit overpowering think huge of musk wafting in the air the day after the guy has been in the neighborhood not so with lacoste live for a man 's fragrance , it 's refreshingly light and citrusy there are some men 's scents that women like to wear , and i can see that with lacoste live it 's not at all that it 's feminine it 's just that it 's such a nice , low key , natural fragrance that women might find it appealing as well i certainly did well , not on me , but on my husband ! not an inexpensive brand , but you 're definitely getting what you pay for here a large eau de cologne , and a smaller spare oh , and one other thing great presentation ! box is nice , and the bottle packaging is definitely cool this would make a great , classy gift , with little chance the male recipient would n't love it
5	i honestly did not expect the polish to be so sheer \( 4 coats required to be opaque yet still not bright \) i recommend painting your nails white then putting about 2 coats of this polish on thanks so much !
5	there is no eye cream that works for crows feet as well as this one i have tried brands and i keep coming back to this
5	reminds me of the the old commercial strong enough for a man gentle enough for a woman works really great for dry skin with a nice fresh smell i have used products and jack black products in the past so i will compare baxter to them the facial is the best i have used and a little goes a long way , very easy to apply i prefer the anthony 's toner as it comes on a pad already but i do like the scent of the baxter toner neutral on the face wash seems to do the job what is nice about the baxter is the price it does the same job of far options for a fraction of the cost \( my toner pads were 22 and soap 22 my jack black 27 for 71 vs 45 for the baxter 1 2 3 \)
5	absolutely love this stuff ordered after seeing use it on a in one of her videos travel friendly packaging , spf , a slight green tint to help redness and it 's just the right texture feels creamy without being too heavy \( although i do wait a few minutes to let it absorb before doing my makeup \)
4	i use this around my eyes and it seems to work pretty well i only use it around my eye area and no where else , and it seems to help with some puffiness and fine lines , although it takes some time to see an improvement it includes vitamin c which is excellent for your facial skin and helps brighten my skin and keep the eye area moisturized it also helps with the redness on my face and around my eyes i will continue to use it does seem very pricey though
5	coverage , love it
3	i received a very small tube of this as a trial from vine i could tell little difference after using the cream as i am an older person it might work better on someone with younger skin considering the price you might want to see if you can get a sample before paying 120 00
3	my son says this made him itchy that led to redness because im highly allergic to lotions , i had him discontinue using it
4	while i do n't have dark spots on my face \( yet \) , my complexion can get blotchy from time to time , especially if have too much wine the night before or i do n't wash my face before bed or im too rough with the washcloth in the shower , etc so , one night , late , i looked in the mirror after brushing my teeth and told myself to make some changes i gently washed my face and applied about a dime sized spot of this night cream on my face and got a decent nights sleep the next day , i was surprised to see noticeable improvement in my complexion , with a decided lack of the nights blotchiness all the redness was n't gone , but it had certainly to a non level the product has a light fragrance that smells somewhat like a cross between vanilla and maple also , its translucent , with a viscosity akin to baby shampoo good stuff
3	its not that i dislike the product the description of the color should be beach sand
5	whoa ! i just got done using this and blowing out my shoulder length fine dry frizzy hair and it is like new hair i used the tiniest dab i could and spread it evenly through my damp hair , then blew it out like always and wow ! i never knew my hair could look this good my hair has shine like never before it holds a soft wave every drop of frizz is gone and that 's a miracle because i have very damaged dry sun baked hair my hair is now perfection i ca n't even feel this on my hands after rubbing it on them to style my hair it has zero scent i used a dab half the size of a pea , so this should last for a year the only con to this is that it did n't come in a box and has no ingredient list i like to know what chemicals i'm using on my hair and skin but the results are better with this than anything i 've yet to use and that 's quite a statement coming from an absolute product junkie what really impresses me the most about this is the way my hair does n't get greasy from it i went for two days without washing my hair after i used this and my hair never felt greasy or weighted down the only way i could tell something was in it was the way it stayed smooth and shiny and controlled this is a gentle hold that smooths and shines it 's for men but women can use it too it wo n't replace a super hold gel but this is perfection for my needs
2	i am not a fan of this polish it has a relatively dull finish and take 3 4 coats to effectively coat the nail i would not recommend that other people purchase this polish
5	love the color has a bit of a brown undertone to it , but it goes well with most grays essie is a thicker polish , some of the darker colors will need 2 coats , but 2 coats is always best for a glossy finish i type a lot and do hand work so it 's nice to have a great color that lasts at least a week before looking like i 've put my nails in the wood chipper !
5	i usually have clear , even toned skin however , when my husband and i started the process my skin turned into a teenagers so i went to a make up specialist in town and had her teach me to cover my acne professionally she used this product it 's tinted enough that when she was applying it i thought it was a foundation however , when its on , it covers up my acne pretty well and evened out my now uneven tone skin she then used neutral light concealer to cover just the acne spots my face looked amazing so , all in all , this product did not cover up my acne enough for me but with this product and touch up concealer your skin looks so even and beautiful ! i will use this product even when my skin hopefully comes back to normal ! update 2 2013 ive been using this product for a couple years now i still absolutely love it im now a mother of which means i do not have the time to do my make up so i put on my daily moisturizer and than throw this on thats it \( most days \) ! it still evens my skin tone out wonderfully i am so so so happy with this product i bought my last one in april and it is now and i am here ordering another one that is a full 5 months using it daily ! ! !
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	i am trying to use the eye mask from the same company now it is nice and silky but it falls off my face about 90 of nights i think my eye are looks better now , but is it due to the magic of copper mask , my new diet , my meds or supplements i am taking , we will never know anyway , i just had to try the pillowcase just in case it does work , and the double blind placebo controlled studies say that copper infused pillowcases do work on reducing wrinkles i figured pillowcase cannot fall off my face , right \? i sleep on my side with over half of the face in the pillow , so i should be golden , unless i forget to turn in my sleep , and then i will be golden on one side only , ouch obviously , the pillowcase will not work if you sleep face up the whole night there be no contact between pillowcase and your face the pillowcase comes rolled in a nice round box \( should be good for gift giving \) the instructions say to machine wash , but not use fabric softener in washer or dryer it leaves me a bit confused what about the dryer sheets \? the package says there were multiple double blind placebo controlled studies that show that the technology \( copper infused fabric \) works for wrinkle reduction interestingly , i could not find any specific on their website , but i did find two articles on pubmed from 2012 and that did support the claim , at least for sleeping on copper oxide containing pillowcases the pillowcases in the studies had 1 and 0 4 copper oxide , respectively , there is no mention on how much copper oxide in the fabric here the website says that color and anti aging technology proven to last over 100 washes the technology sounds very exciting and it is something that is so easy to use sleep on it and that is it i also wanted to say kudos to the company to the before and after photos of mature women with wrinkles sometimes companies advertise anti wrinkle products and show a 25 year old , trying to convince us how good it works on her of course it does , she is 25 , she does not have wrinkles the pillowcase is made of count polyester , and it is rather soft and silky , but it feels exactly as sleeping on a pillowcase
5	after only a few days of using this product , i am noticing a definite improvement in the area around my eyes the dark circles are reduced and my crow 's feet seem less obvious the product dispenses easily through a pump , allowing the user to use as much or as little as needed the texture is lovely , and it smooths on and soaks in quickly , leaving the skin soft but not greasy i'm impressed ! if you want a good product for your eyes , definitely check this one out
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	product was as expected \)
4	shaving is one of the love hate chores men face , pun intended , every day unless you 're as a , it 's an chore that involves time , expense and sometimes wound management since skin sensitivity and beard are unique to each man , there is no one universal best product when it comes to achieving a great shave so results vary and unfortunately require a lot of experimenting as to what works best for you baxter 's close shave formula is not a soap or product that needs to be worked into a lather as other reviewers have also noted , if you normally use a badger hair brush , you do n't need one with this product no matter what their advertising advises and it was counter to use one at least for me the cream is pre whipped and creamy and so only needs to be applied to a wet face with your finger tips and evenly worked into your whiskers it is moderately thick and spreads evenly and quickly i use a merkur progress safety razor with double edge blades and found the shave with baxter 's formula to be smooth and nick free , welcome due to having very sensitive skin the product density and slickness strike a good balance it wo n't adhere to and clog a blade but dissolves easily with each rinse you will use more of the product due to the fact it is ready to use as is and not a solid block that needs a brush to it to build up a before application it should still last several months , so the cost is not excessive if you find it gives you the results you want not requiring the shaving brush step , also saves a little time in the morning which is a plus the ingredients you 'll note after water , there 's stearic acid , an that binds all the ingredients together and is listed second in every shave cream i looked at listed third is soybean oil the third ingredient seems to consistently be either glycerine or a specific oil to supply the viscosity and provide the glide factor if you want to improve your shave regardless of the cream or soap you use , try applying oil to your face after wetting it and before applying your shave cream shave oils are sold as such but can be extremely expensive emu oil is most like the skin sebum naturally produced by our own skin , but a few drops of olive oil is excellent you should find your shave drastically smoother and the thin layer that remains after rinsing is a wonderful moisturizer used for thousands of years in summary , baxter is an effective product , does not require a brush , has a medium creamy consistency that distributes evenly , wo n't clog your razor mid shave , extra protective of sensitive skin and is priced with the time saving factor and results i 've had so far , it will become my shave cream of choice at the moment if you prefer using a badger brush , try taylor of bond street not cheap at around 16 for 5 2 oz , but a premium product if you 're a committed badger brush user
5	i'm surprisingly impressed with this pencil it 's easy to apply , smudges when you ask it to , does n't when you do n't and is a wonderful color it 's lightweight and without texture so you ca n't feel it after it 's been applied it does a wonderful job opening up my eyes without making me look the brown is a great contrast to my dark brown with highlights hair
5	i 've been using this for over 6 months now and have decided this is going to be my new go to moisturizer i 've received so many compliments and people flat out telling me i am not telling them the truth when i tell them i am over 50 my skin tone is even , smaller , and complexion smooth i will invest in this product and it lasts forever , so worth the money i have very sensitive skin prone to break outs i am also 52 , so one of those adults who had to fight wrinkles and acne at the same time thanks mother nature anyway , i 've used this for a week now and i 've had no break outs , but yet my skin feels soft and smooth since i use oil of olay and it works for me \( and it 's half the price \) i 'll stick with it , but this is a nice face cream
4	super hydrating is right my skin feels so soft after using this and not at all greasy in fact my makeup goes on better on top of this than it did over the moisturizer i was using and you do n't even need a primer ! there is no scent and the texture is wonderful i wish the spf was just a little higher , but for everyday this is exactly what i 've been searching for highly recommend
1	maybe i got a bad tube of this stuff or something , because my experience with this product was awful it did absolutely nothing for my eyes it barely looked like i had any mascara on at all ! yet , when i washed my face , all the little tube things came off , but you could n't see them when i was actually wearing the product i do not recommend this at all
4	i wanted to try this primarily for the skin brightening , but also to combat fine lines the ingredient list was n't full of scary things so it was worth trying fine lines the acidic skin peel effect is very mild , and there has n't been enough time to really tell if it 's helping the fine lines around my mouth and eyes the appearance of them is minimized though after application skin brightening this is more obvious i have a freckle on the tip of my nose , and it is noticeably lighter it 's not gone , but i can actually camouflage it with make up now without pulling out the serious concealer i like how well it applies , it smooths easily , and when it 's dry it 's lightweight and nearly unnoticeable
4	i really enjoy using the vichy eye make up remover the rose scent is pleasant , though i think in general i would prefer an unscented product for use around the sensitive eye area the product did not sting , and was very effective at removing every trace of eye makeup i wear eye shadow , liner , brow pencil and non waterproof mascara and was able to remove all of it with just one cotton pad i moistened the pad with the vichy remover , gently on one eye , flipped the pad over and used the clean side for the other eye there was no residue of makeup remaining and i did n't need a second pad of course , your results may vary depending on the type and quantity of makeup products that you use
5	this product is nice for wearing during the day i'm not really sure what makes it pigmentclar , but it 's pretty moisturizing , spreads really well despite the tiny amount that they give you \( the needle nose applicator helps \) , and it has spf as well ! slight sunblock smell , but pretty neutral careful on your first squeeze , as it shoots out do n't want to waste the entire ounce they give you one shot !
4	i was looking for a soft orange or coral color to balance my growing cnd gel polish collection , which is a bit red pink heavy i thought this color would be perfect well i'm going to keep looking as desert poppy is more a warm and bright pink than a mild orange i am dark skinned african american and this color still works for me but the advertised photo is somewhat misleading i would still recommend this product but not if you are looking for a noticeably orange color however , i will add that there is a delicate sparkle when i look at this color in sunlight and i 've had coworkers identify this color on me as coral , so to each her own !
5	like their shaving cream , this product is excellent great smell , great feel , and great ease of use all of that adds up to great value i have made proraso my regular shaving regimen \( these days , that 's just my neck and a little trimming \) and plan on being a regular customer
3	i am a 34 year old woman with a few wrinkles developing on my face and have been using this product for a few weeks now i honestly do n't see any wrinkle improvement , but it 's a great moisturizer ! oh well !
4	i thought the packaging if very unique when i opened it i quickly learned you can slide them onto other products such as their mineral powder the color i received , blossom does n't look at all like the picture it is more of a coral the color is actually pretty sheer which allows you to build the color onto your face for the perfect blushing bride look i have fairly light skin color , so when i dipped my blush brush into this i actually was surprised that it n't as pigmented as it looked this is actually a good thing as this allows for you to build your color gradually this color will look fantastic when i get a little color on my skin for the summer the price point is at the high end and comparable to other high end cosmetics this would be a brand i would consider again
4	good quality product fast drying and relatively chip resistant a bit difficult to remove , but the same is true for all dark polishes
4	i love this stuff i wish it were n't so dang spendy though because i have to use three finger to get enough on my palm to evenly distribute in my hair i tried to be more sparing with it but found that it was n't working at the current rate i'm going , one of these jars will last me just under a month and i'm just not into myself enough to spend so much on a single product on a monthly basis if the price were more reasonable i would consider it , but i guess i 'll call this a short love affair with a great , but expensive , product
4	did n't realize the color is a semi sheer is very pretty , but takes multiple coats to get it opaque
5	good
5	great product
5	love it , fast ship trust which is very great business relationship with customers buyers need to trust them and buy it because i have great positive feel with them
4	good color choices
5	i love this line of products use it daily !
4	div id video block class a section a spacing small a spacing top mini video block div input type hidden name value https images na ssl images amazon com images i mp4 class video url input type hidden name value https images na ssl images amazon com images i png class video slate img url nbsp this foreo iris is an interesting massager , that has a wavy back and forth action \( like your index and middle fingers moving up and down , making a patting type of motion \) it also has a soft vibration combined w the patting as well , on the spa mode the pure mode only has the patting w o the background vibration when you get this , you are supposed to unlock it by pressing the faint plus and minus on top and on bottom of the depression that is the on function off button mine had no power , so i plugged it in for a few hours until the clear plastic pad on the bottom stopped flashing white and became a solid white light a power cord is provided , which has a usb on one side and a rounded charging plug on the other , but you need your own usb plug that fits into a wall socket after charging , i pressed the minus and plus for 3 seconds to try to unlock , as well as the middle depression many times , and in various combinations , with no response at some point , it did turn on , but i'm not sure what i did to make that happen i'm guessing the locking mechanism is strong , and or the buttons not very responsive when i did get it to turn on , i read the very tiny , tiny printed instructions that say if you press the depression button once , you 'll have spa mode , and a second push gives you pure mode in either mode , you can press the plus and minus areas to increase or decrease the intensity of the patting or vibrations my video shows the spa mode using this feels pretty good against my eye area , and even on different parts of my face , like the underside of my chin it certainly is relaxing , and probably helps you just by removing some tension you might carry around in your face muscles the movement is quite different from any other massager i 've ever felt , so i think the fairly high price for this foreo is what you 'll pay for the unique action and sensation if you have facial tension , this will work great i think it helps me a lot in that regard , and will contribute to a more relaxed look , simply because it helps me relax my face overall , once i got this working , and understood the functions , it worked as advertised the function buttons are a bit non responsive i need to press with some directed pressure , but that could be due to the whole thing being covered w a waterproof skin \( feels smooth and soft probably silicone \)
5	i have always been a fan of sara happ 's products i love the yummy smell taste of this peach scrub it makes your lips so soft the lip slip itself is my favorite lip gloss it will last you a long time the lip slip smells like roses it lasts a long time order it , you wo n't be disappointed
5	i have tried several dermablend products recently , and this cover creme is definitely my favorite thus far i think i have finally found my perfect shade for foundation \( warm beige \) it adds a touch of color without looking artificial , and i do n't have to waste time rubbing off excess to tone it down you can use the included plastic stick to scrape off some foundation \( a little can go a long way , but it 's a work of trial and error \) to place on your hand and activate by rubbing , then applying to your face i also used it simply by using my finger to gather up some and then apply it to my face as with dermablend 's other cover cremes , the only negative thing about it is that it 's only somewhat waterproof , as indicated by the foundation left behind on my towels after washing my hands , and napkins from dabbing my face when sweaty at least it does n't all come off the face without a proper washing or makeup remover , however , so it 's not completely bad all in all , i was impressed by this even if it comes off a little too easily
5	great color
4	first off my hair is very blonde highlighted it 's thin but i have a lot of it and it 's alittle past my bra strap i'm growing it out alittle i have used lanza healing oil conditioner , aveda all top brands but i stumbled across this in an upscale salon store and figured i would give it a shot i cringed at the price but after only 2 uses i'm hooked this stuff is amazing ! i plan on buying the travel set for my up coming vacation trip ! i gave 4 stars due to price i think this could be a 40 item however my hair feels like i just left the salon and it smells amazing ! i ca n't wait to see the long term effects of this product if your hair is colored you will love this ! i do n't even have to use any products on my hair except and medium hold moroccan oil finishing spray and my blow outs are great ! i'm not loving oribe 's hair sprays , oils or creams they weigh down my hair but i will continue to buy this edit a few weeks of using this and the shampoo my hair has ever looked better it 's healthy bouncy and over all looks great ! finally a shampoo and that work as promised definitely a fountain of youth product
4	this is a very different type of foundation , very thick , it comes with a little spatula to remove some of the product for application this process did take a little getting used to for me , using the right amount and blending it evenly but once i got the hang of it it really did cover well and did n't use additional concealers with it i used a sponge to apply this and blend it for a nice even coverage , you could use your fingers , however if you are prone to breakouts or skin irritations then a sponge seems a better option for less oil and dirt i used the dermablend powder over this foundation and it really set the look and lasted all day
5	my wife loved it for the thick effect it had on her thinning hair , and i just ordered another bigger size for her ! !
5	pretty color ! love opi
5	great under makeup primer that leaves your skin feeling so smooth ! smells so good and feels wonderful !
5	great neutral color and reliable as are all the opi polishes reliable , prompt service from sender
5	delivered as promised and on time works great i love it
1	it softened my skin dramatically i do n't quite have leather foot , but i do like to go barefoot when possible and that includes outside so i have tough skin this worked well i smells smells all right , is creamy and hydrating without being too oily but it has t had triclosan in it something the eu has or is taking off the market because it is n't safe to use so , yeah i wo n't be using this again
5	like all opi , this has a great formula and goes on smoothly in two coats this orangey red has a lot of , so if you 're an opi lover , check your stash it is very similar to cajun shrimp and red lights ahead , where \?
5	i 've never been particularly impressed by the electric shavers i 've used in the past they never seemed to give me a close enough shave and would leave my legs feeling prickly even after multiple passes i'm pleased to report that the lumarx shaver gives me a close enough shave that it 's nearly indistinguishable from a regular multi blade razor shave this shaver is wet dry , so you can use it in the shower \( but do not submerge it in water or use it in the bath ! \) i personally prefer using it dry , though , but that 's mostly because my bathroom can be rather cold , and the shaver is not terribly comfortable going over but it runs smoothly over my legs and gave a close shave after one or two passes it was a bit uncomfortable on my armpits , but my skin there is rather sensitive and would need to get used to an electric shaver you should charge this shaver for 24 hours before first use and continue to charge it as the instructions say after you use it a single charge allows for 30 minutes of shaving , which can last multiple days the shaver opens up easily for cleaning , and you can rinse it out , which is a nice bonus for cleaning i have n't used the trimmer attachment yet , but i 'll update my review once i do overall \? this is a really great electric shaver i may be converted when it comes to shaving my legs
5	love this polish this is my second bottle and it is perfect it arrived very fast and has been worn several times on my fingers and toes
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	a reorder for a friend that uses for a home business always pleased with it
5	ok i tried the cinnamon one , it was a little too dark for my skin my mother is a little darker than i am and it was almost too light for her it kind of made her look ashy for both of us , with a little extra blending , the product could work it 's of great quality and let me tell you it does not take a lot which means this will last a long time it 's also hard to get off which is good and bad it does n't rub off on clothes but i had to scrub to get it off all in all , great product , not drying or caking
4	i have been a jack black product fan for several years i discovered the brand at a nordstrom event years ago and began using their shampoo , conditioner and double duty moisturizer on a regular basis i especially liked their sun block and it helped me get through this past summer without a hint of a sun burn despite hours working outside good stuff , all i really became a jack black when i tried \( through the vine program \) their protein booster skin serum despite the rather steep price , this product eased a consistent of dry skin problem on my forehead and cheeks then , i discovered that the dry erase ultra calming face cream was a companion product and that they recommended that you combine them for maximum moisturizing i \( and my wife \) have been using this product for about two weeks and it definitely works as advertised i have small red splotches on the top of my cheeks from years of wind and sun abuse and after a few days of regular use , the redness toned down and the skin felt less tight then , when i combined it with the \( super expensive ! ! \) skin serum , it seemed to work a even a little better that could be the cumulative effect of consistent use or just wishful thinking but i am pleased with the way the products seems to work together on my problem areas my wife has fair skin and she sees occasional red patches on her cheeks when she has worked under the sun in the garden with two weeks of use of just this face cream , she too sees an improvement yes , the summer sun is months gone but the product does seem to be helping her the jack black dry erase ultra calming face cream has a pleasant scent it absorbs easily and does n't leave a greasy feel on your hands of face i'm not sure if it 's any better than the double duty moisturizer that i had been using but it is an effective product that does when the maker claims so the questions is is it worth the high price especially when you consider that they suggest that you combine it with another even more expensive product for maximum value \? hard to say and i think that 's a decision you 'll have to make for yourself my opinion it works as claimed on my and my wife 's skin and there is a noticeable improvement in overall skin softness there is certainly a lot less dryness around the spots that were problems so , on that basis alone , i recommend that you try it for yourself have dry skin and want to try a quality product that could help this could be your solution
3	great color but something is not right with this polish the color is dull even with a top coat not sure what 's wrong with it
2	i was excited to try this out since i 've always wanted to try out jane iredale products , but was disappointed to see that it contains a few different citrus oils if you follow paula begoun at all , you 'll know that citrus oils can dry out lips and cause irritation , and that 's exactly what i 've found to be the case the few times i 've used this the oils do cause it to smell nice and it 's not sticky or tacky , but when i 've been wearing it a lot , i definitely notice that it dries out my lips , instead of moisturizing them if this were re formulated , i would definitely try it again , but as it is i ca n't recommend it
5	i tend to use a lot of good products on my eyes , most recently nia 24 my eyes are really important to me for me , the issues are n't so much wrinkles but bags and the feeling of my eyes after using this product , i kept wanting to touch my eyes , just because of how smooth and soft they feel it 's hard not to touch them the skin around my eyes is just so soft and supple plus i smell good what 's not to like about that \?
5	the color is really beautiful , it lasts a lot , doesnt fade i always buy this nail polish and have never had any concerns about it
5	my favorite spring and summer coral !
4	this is a scented lightweight lotion for the prevention of marks and to help reduce the look of existing ones as a new mom i'm using it for the latter purpose the cream itself is moisturizing without stickiness or oiliness but it does take awhile to soak in and leave that nice matte feeling i 've been applying it to my stretch marks and while i feel it will be awhile before i know how well it works to fade them it is deeply moisturizing so i can definately see this going a long way towards preventing them the breast firming serum is the reason i'm giving this set as a whole four stars rather than five it 's thick and not nearly as to apply as the cream it takes so long to soak in that i can only use it when i'm pretty sure i wo n't be nursing the baby soon even then i have to keep on an old shirt after i use it since i'm not comfortable getting it on the inside of my nursing that said , i does seem to have a firming effect for now i 'll be saving it until my little one is older and i do n't have to worry so much about timing the application of it
5	this is a great summer polish for toes and fingers , but i mostly wear it on my toes it 's a great shade of pink that does n't clash with anything else you might be wearing and essie pretty much wo n't chip \( at least on your toes \) for at least a week great great color !

4	good coverage , easy to apply and really covered up the blemishes i was most concerned with it stayed on pretty good until i started sweating a lot
4	this lathers really nice and leaves you feel very clean !
5	i 've been using this product for 14 years great product ! i only found out recently that i can get it cheaper on amazon
5	love
5	these are great for removing dead skin , improving skin quality and reducing breakouts this four set is better priced than individual purchasing of the brush heads , and will last a year at normal use \( clarisonic recommends changing every 3 months \) this fits on both the mia and the
5	i love jane iredale products ! excellent quality and they last for a long time so no need to be a frequent buyer
4	this is a good medium coverage concealer if youve got some minor imperfections , moderate redness or mild to moderate discoloration this will do the trick , but if you 're looking to cover any significant scarring or pigmentation issues youll need something heavier this formula is very easy to work with its creamy and easy to blend just dab a tiny amount on the area you want to cover then gently tap it in with your finger or a concealer brush ive been able to use this on the under eye area and as long as i apply it sparingly it doesnt emphasize the fine lines and wrinkles i generally shy away from concealers for everyday use as they tend to look unnatural , but i really like this formulation a definite thumbs up !
5	i really like this product and use it in multiple applications after shaving my legs it helps reduce any irritation my teenage daughter has used it on the t zone area of her face and it really does help control oil perhaps one of the best uses is for my youngest daughter who is still in diapers and inherited my sensitive skin she can literally get a rash overnight but absolutely hates the feel of diaper ointment and will walk around like a cowboy for hours after it 's been applied i used this instead of and it did n't bother her at all it did do a great job of soothing her skin and helping the rash disappear it 's really one of those rare multi use cosmetic products that almost anyone in the family can find a use for , especially if you have sensitive skin it feels like a light spray of water going on and does n't leave any uncomfortable residue just great results definitely a bathroom must have
5	love how this feels ! great spray and quantity that comes out have used other facial hydration sprays that are no where near as good as this love it !
5	have used product for 5 yrs works well
3	i do n't usually use a primer , although i have purchased some in the past and have found that they just feel too heavy on my skin , although they do seem to keep my foundation looking good longer i was interested to try this jouer primer since i love their moisturizing tint so much the primer does go on light and has no oily feeling unfortunately , it 's a little tough to apply , it does n't smooth on easily unless i use more than i feel i should once applied it feels like nothing no moisturizing that i can tell , no anything to test , i used the primer on half of my face , and my regular moisturizer on the other , then applied makeup foundation does seem to lay better on the skin on top of the primer side , but the appearance of fine lines is the same with or without the primer my makeup looked the same on both sides of my face after 8 hours , but the side with the primer did look a tiny bit better on my cheek where i rest the phone overall , it 's not a bad product , but there 's not enough of a noticeable difference over using my regular moisturizer and foundation , or my new fave , the jouer moisture tint
5	i find this moisture tint to be perfect for a quick application for photo or video shooting it slightly conceals your on your face without looking unnatural , but gives you a healthy look it also tones down the oily shine and reflection from the camera flesh or video lights that you want to avoid you might still need a thin coat of powder to further prevent light most importantly it saves time , comparing to applying a foundation , and it makes you look healthier on film
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
5	i love opi polish never have complaints there this polish has more of a mauve tone to it
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	favorite color from essie love the name to to buy or not to buy \? very nice , and whatever you can say about nail polish
5	i absolutely love this therapy cream when i put it on it feels so decadent glides on so smooth it is thick but soaks in well it has a pleasing scent smells like coconut \( or so my family tells me \) yet , the smell does n't linger it is a pleasure to put this on my face and , since i am 48 years old i am beginning to get a few lines on my face and i believe this has made the lines on my forehead lessen i definitely , definitely , very definitely recommend this therapy cream
4	effective and pleasant i would order again
5	i love mb products , and count on their uniform quality this shampoo is great smells wonderful and rinses cleanly a staple in my routine
5	i love essie nail polish it is easy to apply goes on smoothly color is beautiful ! long lasting will buy more essie nail polish
5	have used this cleanser for several years it has done a great job of cleansing my dry skin without drying it further this line of products is excellent
5	i recently tried dermablend 's smooth liquid camo medium coverage foundation it really made my skin dry but this concealer stick goes on a lot differently blends really nice it 's easy to apply conceals blemishes really well i also use it under my eyes for dark circles and it blends really nice i 'll keep giving it continued use , but as of now , it 's one of the best coverage sticks i 've used regarding my skin i have very dry , sensitive skin i'm always looking for a product that will not only go on smooth make my skin feel moisturized , i'm wary of products that might irritate my skin so far , i 've had great luck with the dermablend line no reaction huge plus if you 're looking for a concealer , i would hands down recommend you give this a try i think it 's a great product !
3	it seems like the scent is either loved or hated i am a little , but am leaning to the love camp i do n't think it is overpowering the cream is light enough to go on easily i have been using it before bed and in the morning i do n't see miracles , but also do n't expect them my eyes feel uncomfortable at night due to the cream leaking into them , but not as badly as with the majority of the eye creams i have tried i do n't like the huge ingredient list and would prefer if it was in english , not just italian like many cosmetics , it is way over packaged the box is big , but the actual jar is small and the contents tiny it works ok , but not enough better than other products for me to buy more , especially at this price
5	product delivered and obtained at a reasonable price
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
5	the sepia skin tone is the right one for me during the summer months the liquid camo covers well and lasts long i have broken capillaries near my nose and it covers those it also blends the uneven skin tones that i have on my face it works well with both the oily and dry patches of my skin this is definitely a product i will continue to use in the future
5	gentle exfoliate for sensitive skin like mine living in northern new england in the winter this product by pca is the best for gently removing the dry irritated skin in the winter and in the summer as well i follow up with the pca hydrator spf 30 to protect my skin all year long
4	this foundation offers fairly good coverage i felt like it blended into my skin easily it did feel a little bit heavier than what i am accustomed to wearing \( i typically prefer a lightweight tinted moisturizer \) , but it did a good job of covering blemishes and evening out my skin tone it also did a fairly good job of lasting throughout the day it does provide a nice , smooth finish
2	kind of disappointed the other good reviews and product experience with jack black the purchase but i am not impressed at all by the scent almost like a cheap detergent smell it is light , at first , almost davidoff white water like smell but it fades away quickly and it takes quite a few sprays to get anything lasting it is body spray so i am not expecting the strength of a eau de toilette , but it fall short of my high exception of jack black products my first disappointment with jack black
5	tropix is definitely a hot bright color the color has more orange in it than i wanted i thought of this color as cajun shrimp since i am a pink color person , i ca n't say it 's one of my favorites but i still like it
2	i was really excited to try this product because of all the good reviews on it , but i was really disappointed i get horribly dry lips if i'm not careful enough and i read on sites and heard tons of great reviews for this product now , this may just be from the color of the flavor , but when i applied it to my lips it made them look even drier however the product itself , ignoring the color , did not improve my chapped lips at all i'm still trying to use it and see if it works better on lips that are n't dry , but so far i'm having the same issue i would n't totally the idea of it , however i may try it in another color to see if it was just the pale one that made my flaky lips stand out
4	unless you have a deep tan or are otherwise brown skinned , this honey shade will probably be too dark for you as it was for me it applies darker than the color that shows through the tube more of a light medium brown the shade was nice , just too dark for me and it applied smoothly it covers well reminding me a bit of actor 's pancake makeup in covering well , and i like that it 's spf 25 the pigment leaves a tint for a while after you remove it with water , that is , it does not wash off completely though it does wear off completely after washing \( takes a few hours \) if you get a shade you like , this would be a plus , as it covers well and lasts
5	i like the cream it 's so beautiful
5	this stylus is similar to a flat iron , but with less risk of burning it 's a great iron for creating lift on short to shoulder length hair it warms up quickly and has several choices in heat settings i was less than successful creating curls but that just may take some practice
5	another winner from la roche posay ! absolutely love this ! they had something similar a few years back that i found in paris but could never find here once i ran out the good news , this is even better and it truly in so well with your skin that you need the tiniest amount , seriously squeeze too much out and you 'll have more than you need love that it has n't made my skin breakout yet either when most makeups \( even acne safe ones \) usually do ! i'm pretty fair , irish skin with a little redness and the lighter of the colors works fine just a little more rubbing with my fingers to in
2	a rare miss from la roche posay it has a fluffy , like texture , and it blended on my skin nicely , providing a good amount of coverage however , as the day progressed my skin began to feel like an oil slick the product also seemed accentuated my pores and fine lines as the day went on i have oily , acne prone skin , so this might work better for someone with drier skin
5	i have loved this line , and it is one of the products i rotate for my , curly hair it smells good , light scent and i use it with the curl good combination
3	these only last a day or so for me
4	me nearly 50 with dry , sensitive skin normally i hate scents in skincare this smells a little like coconut so it 's quite pleasant to smell you need very little of this otherwise it feels a little greasy upon application , but give it a few minutes and it completely soaks in make up goes on smoothly over the top of this cream and i do n't need to use a separate primer beforehand i have n't used it long enough to see any cumulative effects , but i 'll update if i do it 's supposed to blur lines and wrinkles , but i do n't see that yet , either the directions say to apply this over their truffle serum i'm just about any serum would be ok i use this over my meaningful beauty creme de serum as the meaningful beauty is n't moisturizing enough on its own pros no parabens , and not tested on animals made in italy con i wish it was in a pump bottle as i hate contaminating cream by dipping my fingers into it fortunately , i have a small spatula i kept from a different cream i used in the past note the amazon title says 1 ounce , but the jar is actually 1 7 ounces
5	love this i do my own nails and use this for a natural pink color great product
5	this is wonderful hand cream it has a great feel going on not greasy or wet , but very good at making hands no longer dry feeling it 's more like a paste than most hand creams i 've tried it comes out almost looking like toothpaste , but it has a much more smooth spread than that ! this is a product supposed to be made especially for men with 2 adult sons and a husband in the household , i was easily able to have men test it ! they liked it very much too , although i am not completely sure there is anything about it especially male , except for the non feminine packaging but all sexes need hand cream at times , so it 's a good product for all of us !
5	excellent
5	i have extremely dry skin and i started using this when i first got it i can tell you my face feels great and it is not irritating at all i love this product
5	my favorite soothing and hydrating toner i have combo oily skin and use it after a clay mask or on days nights when my skin is a bit inflamed from allergies
5	this one is perfect for styling my medium length bob i first bought the medium , which is like a small , and then the large , but that 's more like a medium this extra large one is perfect , surprisingly so , i thought this size would only work on really long hair but it 's just right for straightening out mine very happy with it ! \( and it 's the same brand my hair stylist uses , and they know best ! \)
5	love this stuff use it with the body wash a couple of times a week will sting especially if broken skin the burn tingle in a few minutes
3	the packaging on this curling iron makes some pretty hefty claims i 'll be honest , it is no different than any other curling iron i 've ever used , other than having a bigger barrel
5	i have , and as others who have this know , it can make your hair look and feel like straw and thin out i 've done a natural curls journey for a year now \( do n't straighten blow out hair , mostly use products that are wholly or mostly based on herbs and natural oils \) but i was getting a trim and decided to just let them do the treatment there \( though i usually do protein treatments at home , either k by or repair me ! by curl junkie or the spiral solutions repairing protein treatment \) this stuff is great expensive \( in salon , the one treatment was 45 bucks before tips tax etc \) my curls tightened up \( this is what usually happens when my hair is protein treated , it my curl pattern , which is great \) my frizz was down my hair was softer and it literally felt \( i have very fine hair \) so , a thumbs up for the two step treatment on this product make sure to use the conditioner after \( all protein treatments of high strength should be moisturization after , or your hair can feel dry \) i do n't know if this is a fair price or fair shipping , but i did want to say the product give excellent results for dry damaged weak thin hair
1	generally speaking , i love this line but this product should not be called a scrub it it should not even be sold the sporadic sharp grains of almonds are very abrasive and my skin can take almost any scrub in fact i rarely find an scrub this so called scrub however is in every way baking soda delivers way more value
5	these pads are one of the single best values in mens care you can buy you get 60 of them for about 21 what you do n't realize until you get them is that they are huge the picture makes you think of a stridex \( or similar \) package these pads are easily 2 times bigger than your normal round facial pads in fact , they are so big that what i do is keep scissors in the bathroom and cut them in half a half of one of these is as big as a normal pad and will easily do your whole face you can essentially double the value by doing this overall , they work great and are very gentle they do not burn like other brands and can be used right after shaving without any problems they are refreshing and have a good small without being girly i like to use these in conjunction with the jack black diy face peel pads two days of these , third day jack black works like a charm how do i know \? my 10 year old daughter recently asked me what i had been doing because i did n't look as old as before ! ! now that 's an endorsement
5	love this serum ! use it every day every night smooths out skin texture ! best ever !
3	packaging looks nice , but was a little creepy at first several with product come in this kit , and fortunately were not broken i applied this botanical treatment which smells like rosemary on my head massaging it into my scalp where my scalp is itchy and hair thin i cannot detect new growth , but my scalp is no longer flaking after two applications considering the cost of this product , i think the manufacturer would be wise to consider adding inserts inside the box to keep this classy , high end product safe in shipping at the price charged , i 'd buy this if it hair
5	love pevonia products , especially this cleanser it is gentle enough to use everyday with the crystals
2	i like wearing neutral color on my nails and i usually love essie i went with this color to get some subtle glitter i was disappointed with the product it goes on with lots of streaks it needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish i stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it does n't last as long the good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color does n't show i wore it for almost a week , so that 's good i doubt that i would have been able to do it with 3 coats , but i will experiment it is a good color for the office , but i still wish that it was less watery
5	liquid gold !
5	my granddaughter has been asking for these nail polish the day after i ordered them she loves the color and the nail product they came all together and in very good condition they came on time thanks teresa
4	i am guilty of not realizing these were for men before i decided to try them , but i have to say , they work pretty well for the ladies too ! although now my husband is fighting over them with me the smell is very herbal and fairly strong , but i found it to be pleasant the pads themselves are thin , but sturdy you are to use on a clean face 2 4 times a week , and i strongly suggest you adhere to that direction they are pretty strong , and i imagine too much use would on your face my one complaint is that they left a definite film on my face i washed my face and then used the pad and it felt like a sticky , substance was left behind the directions said nothing about rinsing your face afterwards , so i left it for a little while , assuming it would dry and feel better instead , it dried and felt like a film across my face like i was wearing one of those peel masks it annoyed me so much i had to rinse my face thoroughly to remove the remnants of the pad after the rinse , however , my face felt fabulous although , i kept thinking of all that gunk left behind from the pad and how that would have clogged my pores had i left it i am prone to acne , so i am skeptical of anything that leaves behind a residue on my face after repeated uses , i have to say this stuff seems to have really worked well on my face i am not sure i would pay the seriously high price for the product , but if you are willing to shell out the money , this is n't a bad product but think about rinsing after you use the pad ! i think it is an important step !
5	my skin loves this and it reduced the appearance of my expression line i am on my second bottle
4	very happy it does n't smell like seaweed ! i look forward to putting this on my face all day long
5	i have extremely dry \( due to thyroid condition \) , frizz prone , super curly hair i use intensive conditioners , always my local beauty shop owner recommended this a few months ago , and i was put off by the price a couple weeks ago , though , i smelled it , was by the scent \( think of a seductive or oil , cause it has that sort of smell that reminds me of both , enough \) i bought it i tried it i'm sold ! it 's not just hype this mask really hydrates my hair and leaves it silky , manageable , , and easier to style and , oh , the scent i'm gonna get the shampoo and regular conditioner today i bought the oil , but i have n't used it yet good stuff , and the price in my local area beauty stores for this very large jar \( 2 cups worth of mask creme \) is fifty bucks so , online can give one a price break
5	my favorite hair spray
5	hands down jack black is one of the best hair care product lines in the market wax pomade by jack black is another fine example how well they know how to make a good product for men the wax is firm , and looks all natural in application , i find it easier on damp hair , rather than dry hair , and just layer it in a bit at a time , in the desired area like on the sides if you have dark brown or black hair , the result is enhanced shine that stays for a long time the hold is n't ultra firm , but it keeps the shape unless you get it wet it has very very light scent , almost unnoticeable after it 's applied it does take some use to if you are used to using hair gel or foam this wax is way better than foam and may not replace the gel you are using it 's great on mustaches
5	at first i was a bit hesitant to use this product because i already found a morning spf moisturizer that i really like to my surprise , this is my new holy grail morning lotion also , i am a sucker for packaging and this one did not disappoint the bottle is very sleek and it has a built in pump it contains 2 3 ounces , which is a good size not only does it provide uva uvb and spf 34 protection , it is also light weight lotion and quickly absorbs quickly in the skin it contains antioxidants and , which helps rejuvenate and hydrate the skin it is light weight and doesnt leave a white cast on my face it wears well underneath my foundation with no pilling on my skin
3	it does n't seem to do anything and my face still seems dry
3	i have been shaving for a number of years now and have tried just about every type of razor and shaving product available when i got the chance to review this shave cream i thought it would be something different since i have tried several expensive blades but never a shave cream at this price the cream itself had a great scent and is easy to apply unfortunately because it does not really lather or foam it is hard to tell how much is needed i tried shaving with this using safety razors as well as a blade and it never was as comfortable or smooth as a regular shave gel the only place where this worked really well was in trimming my side burns because it was clear and i could easily see how much i was shaving other than that specific purpose it is hard to recommend this cream especially considering its high price
5	awesome leaving conditioner lightweight , light small and otherwise the best !
3	disappointed because normally when i buy this product from sephora \( and i 've been using this product for years ! \) , it lasts a few 3 6 months but this time i bought it from amazon and the eyeliner i received from the seller lasted 2 weeks \( with normal use ! \) and i had bought 2 eyeliners with my purchase so it was n't just an purchase where i somehow got a faulty one both eyeliners ran dry after 2 weeks each something 's fishy from this seller definitely fishy if an eyeliner that normally can last 3 6 months now runs out after two weeks of daily use for very conservative and barely there eyeliner \? ! \? i'm sticking to sephora next time
5	i am new to the japonesque line of products this is only the second one that i have tried but like the first , a lip lacquer , i am impressed with the velvet touch primer the name does say it all this primer goes on like velvet without leaving behind a heavy or greasy film it provided a nice base for my makeup and helped even my drug store foundation look better and last longer than usual other primers sometimes leave behind a sticky feeling but this one does not so i can see this working well for even the oiliest of skin types the price point is high compared to drug store products but on par with department store cosmetic counters and is definitely worth considering if you are looking for a quality primer
5	i guess i should have read the fine print this is like a clear coat with a pink hue to it it 's pretty , but not really a color polish in the sense that you think it will color your nail it just gives it a nice subtle pink i think it 's pretty , but not really my thing
5	i bought a sample of this , but i tried this product before and most la roche posay sunscreens i tried are great products the aox daily antioxidant serum is a very lightweight but hydrating product like most spf 50 products it leaves a slight shine to the face , but once i got my make up on , all look great the finish is silicon like to the touch it wears very well under make up during the day
5	i have baby fine , wavy to curly hair , i think it would be a i am able to get a lot of spiral curls when i use this product it enhances defines my curls to a it adds shine i ca n't tell i have product in my hair sometimes i will add a gel on top like i started out with a small bottle just to try it out a little goes a long way
5	thankfully , this does n't have the excessive fragrance problem of some other mustela baby products it 's basically unscented when i try it on my hands , i feel a slight cooling tingling sensation , which could be nice for a baby with diaper rash seems like a good barrier protectant from the numbers 1 and 2 which are irritating skin note it 's a little smooth i do n't have a good basis to say if it 's better or worse than nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href triple paste medicated ointment for diaper rash 16 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 triple paste medicated ointment for diaper rash , 16 ounce a , which is thicker , easy to use , very effective , and way way cheaper i 'd say it 's effectiveness is kind of similar despite giving it 5 stars , given the cost , i 'd use the triple paste
3	i'm reviewing this early \( i e , the company recommends using this for 60 days and i 've been using it for 30 \) , however the for this review was half way through the recommended period over which you would see dramatic results i'm not a spa person , so the little shocks were a bit off putting , though as i 've improved my technique , i do n't go past my hairline as much and have minimized shocks if you are sensitive to pain , this may not be the treatment for you it 's not a big , bad shock , just a little zap which can be unsettling if you 're not prepared for it the good lots of great videos to help the learn how to use this tool also , it 's a great size , not clunky fits very ergonomically into your hand the bad i'm a busy person do n't see this as a permanent fixture in my routine they have a video where a woman is using the device while children off to school i'm not a multi i'm also so i prefer to be in front of a mirror when using this , even after four weeks also , you will be spending money for the face lubricant every few months , so add that to the list of considerations when contemplating purchasing this product \( disclaimer i do n't know how much this process is worth in spa dollars , so you may come out ahead ! \) the it 's a well designed machine i did n't see a great deal of difference , but the ritual itself is very soothing i say , if this is your thing , then it 's probably worth the price
3	i was skeptical when i started using this , but after several weeks i can see small results they are subtle , but there is a difference in both looks and feel however , because the difference is so slight , i doubt anyone besides me would notice it at such a high price for one tube , i'm not sure it is worth the continued expense
4	i really liked londontown lakur nail polish in the trolley away shade it 's a nice purple color i felt that the pigmentation was high quality i used a base coat by julep after that dried , i applied two thin coats of trolley away i put a clear top coat on to protect the color this polish lasted me about a week i am pretty rough on my nails , so a week to me , is a good amount of time
5	this along with the rinse is my go to i can go almost six weeks between salon visits ! that 's saying a lot !
5	i love this product for my husbands red face he has a lot of red in his skin and this product helps to reduce the redness it 's fantastic ! !
5	nice but i do n't think it does much refreshing during hot summer days and i use this on my cosmetic sponges before blending my concealer
4	it 's as described a dark grey looks nice in the light because of the light shimmer it has two coats does the trick not a thick formula
5	this is a great curler , love it very much works amazing , the cord does n't get tangled , and much more this has been another great buy from amazon
5	i do n't think i 've used this long enough to see real results yet but from what i have seen it 's working so i 'll continue to buy until i'm satisfied with how my skin looks
5	i have very fine , thin , colored hair finding a conditioner that does n't weigh my hair down is a constant struggle obliphica professional seaberry fine to medium conditioner is the product i 've been looking for ! ! it smells amazing and has a lovely feel in the hand it is not too thick or too watery , and works great on my hair i use about a silver dollar sized dollop and run it through my hair this comes in a super handy pump bottle which makes getting it out with one hand super easy no caps to unscrew i 'll be ordering the shampoo as soon as my current bottle runs out
4	love butter polish this color was just a bit light for me has shimmer to it but is light even with 2 coats
5	i use this only 3 times a week and it does a good job brightening my complexion amazon 's price is good too
5	love it !
3	honestly i think this lip gloss is way overpriced it comes in a very thin tube ! so very little product is in it also the cap is very cheap , it does n't twist on well , it feels like if i put a bit of pressure screwing it on it will break the gloss itself is decent , it 's a thicker consistency and stickier a bit so it lasts longer , which i do n't mind , it 's not too goopy i got the color , which on my lips shows up more like a berry color i thought it would be more mauve nude definitely the pictures that are on here look nothing like the actual product a lipgloss like this from other brands costs between 10 20 not sure what 's so special about this to cost 30 after tax
4	prior to the mia fit i was using the mia 2 to be honest , they are both basically the same thing they have very similar features both have two speeds , both charge with a magnet style cord , both have a timer on the cleansing the main feature change is the style of the device , which now fits in your palm like an egg vs a paddle style design it 's really an thing and i do seem to prefer cleansing with the fit i feel like i get a better gauge of things and it 's more comfortable if you have the mia 2 and are n't looking to splurge there really honestly is n't anything that i honestly feel is worth upgrading over to the new device however if you do n't have either one and are looking to get a new one , i highly recommend the fit if possible , the best idea is to go to someplace like ulta and see which feels best in your hand before giving it a go and then going from there i do really enjoy the cleanser that comes with the mia and already purchased a full sized version
3	let 's see the product page says this perfume the woman who is dangerous in a good way that , i guess , eliminates use by , , double agent , , and me i'm just not dangerous , in either good or bad ways , and , in addition , this perfume is not a good fit for me not exactly the fault of the perfume it has some pleasant notes of honeysuckle , berries , gardenia and sandalwood , to name a few of the floral and fruity fragrances but i find the caramel and vanilla bottom notes to be too strong and the overall impression the perfume leaves on me is of almost excessive sweetness i prefer a cleaner , , more citrusy fragrance my very favorite perfume even has hints of leather and tobacco to it so what was i doing getting this to try out \? well , in my defense , i did n't think it would be quite so sweet and was expecting more floral notes to it the good news is that i was able to this to a family member who enjoys the fragrance so all 's well and that ends well
5	good , nice color
4	this product exceeded my expectation great moisturizer without being too greasy great coverage without being caked on i use it on days i want some light coverage without using foundation and need spf coverage as well this product gives my skin a nice even glow and smoothness the only reason i gave it four out of five stars , was the scent it 's too flowery smelling and gives me a slight headache as i am sensitive to perfumes in this way the smell does eventually fade though so i use it anyway due to the other things i like about it
5	great color !
5	my wife and i have been using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href cetaphil daily facial cleanser dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 cetaphil daily facial cleanser a nbsp for several years and we 're pretty happy with how it cleans without drying our skin my wife does use some additional facial cleaners products and was excited to try out the tizo foaming cleanser after using it just a few times she was hooked and very happy with how the cleanser performed based on her experience i decided to give the cleanser a shot and i can see why she 's a fan this is a gentle cleanser with a light , fresh scent that cleans my skin , which tends to be a bit oily , without leaving me feeling like my skin is dry i can definitely recommend this product and it 's definitely something we plan on ordering in the future
4	vichy is a new line for me , so i cannot compare the toner to their other products i can say that it is highly fragranced regardless of this being marketed as fine for sensitive skin the color of the liquid is a beautiful blue , but i would prefer having no added colors to my skin care products the first few times i used this , i did not like its effect on my skin but my taste must have changed since i now find it rather stimulating i would suggest to those who do not care for scented skin care products that it is best to check this one out in person before ordering it is even more flowery than the lancome toner or eye make up remover
1	it may be an old essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails
4	if used properly this cover cream will give a light coverage that will not sink into lines , will protect from sun damage , and give a nice even color just make sure that you blend first on the back of your hand for the best results if you are older as am i , you are not going to find a miracle line and wrinkle eraser but rather basically a one step sun screen and color makeup check the company 's shade chart for best results i have used two in the fair column and both work well
4	my facialist uses this on me so i thought i would buy some for my self it works well , but so does burts beeswax for much cheaper i used it during the winter \( i live in southern texas so it doesnt get that cold \) and it kept my lips from getting cracked , and i have so big lips i think this would be great in the winter , especially in colder climates
5	love it
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	much like some of the peptide based regenerist products from olay , this makes my skin feel very soft and moisturized if the skin is a bit irritated \( from sun \) , the tizo cream can feel like it is burning the skin even on normal skin , i 'd feel a warm sensation based on its price though , i 'd say this is a good product but there are probably equivalent alternatives at a more affordable price that being said , i do n't use a whole lot of it on my face , just at some key areas that tend to dry up or where wrinkles form overall 4 5 stars
5	this is the perfect pink and i really love it order and i do n't think you will be disappointed at all
5	love the smell seems to be easier on the nails
5	let me start by saying all of the proraso creams are excellent they lather so easily ! i have been partial to proraso white decided to give this one a spin the blue is the best in proraso 's lineup of creams and that is saying something of lather with just a dime size dollop in your shave bowl or smeared around your wet beard if you prefer face lathering fresh , clean , pleasant scent face is smooth and soft all day due to the aloe in the cream rinses clean with no residue left on your face i find no need for any aftershave just buy it and get your shave on !
5	for many years , i 've wondered how my hair stylist makes it look so easy when she 's blowdrying my hair i 'd watch her technique and try to mimic it at home , but it was never the same my hair is shoulder length with a few long layers and my round barrel brush would never glide through my hair while i'm drying it at home instead , my damp hair would just stick or snag on the brush so , for years , i 've been doing more of a full blowout each time , separating out each small individual section , wrapping it around the brush , fully drying it , and then moving on to another small section to repeat the whole process and , sure , the time consuming blowout looks nice and full and great but who has time for that each and every time \? all this time , i 've assumed that i was the problem like maybe i'm blowdrying challenged or something but , no , it now seems that it was more the brush than my own i 've been using 2 metal and conair brushes for i do n't know how long and i 'd thought that my latest one was particularly nice with its gel handle but after reading some of the reviews of this nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href bio ionic blue wave nano ionic conditioning brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 bio ionic blue wave nano ionic conditioning brush a , i decided to order it and give it a try as a change i'm now a blowdrying \( okay , not really but much , much better than what i was before \) the slightly barrel allows you to catch the hair down near the roots to get lift there the best part , though , is that the brush does that gliding thing that my hair stylist 's brush does you know , where the brush lifts up at the roots and then glides down the whole length of the hair section as you 're drying it and then , with a slight roll of the brush , starts right back up at the roots again i was never able to do that with my old brushes without it snagging and stopping i'm really not sure why this brush works so much better for me is it the shape of the barrel that does it or is it the natural complex that the bristles are supposed to be infused with that allows the brush to glide \? all i know is that it takes me less than half the time to dry my hair now and the finish is much smoother highly recommended
4	my niece has been fighting acne problems for several years not severe just enough to be and annoying she has been using the juice beauty organics to clear skin kit for a couple of weeks now and it appears to be doing a pretty good job of clearing it up for her the cleanser seems to be the best part of the kit the moisturizer , not so much too thick and feels clogging and the scent is less than wonderful each person 's skin is different , of course , so this probably works better on some than others definitely worth trying and she will continue to use the cleanser still not sure of the final outcome here i will post updates as i hear more
5	i like it work great on hair make it look fuller great
4	i like this product , will give a try for a few months to see if it helps any with wrinkles it is a little thinner then i like , but will give it a try color was a good match goes on really well looks good
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	very pretty
5	this is a scent that i give to my son this scent is fairly spicy but it is also clean crisp it is fairly intense for the first hour , but it then it transitions to a very pleasant subtle aroma that almost steps into the background it is fairly sophisticated , but it also works as a casual scent
5	saw this color featured in several magazines , and was happy to see it available here the color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors stunning with grays , jewel tones , and a real pop with black i like essie because it stays on nicely without chipping essie always has the perfect updated colors this color will look great with whatever you wear this winter \( the lace is on \) also bought another 2013 color , vested interest this is a lovely matte color , a greenish gray , that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors love the slightly edgy vibe , but super wearable , and looks fabulous on short nails
4	while this probably deserves a 5 star rating for how cool and sharp they are , i just ca n't imagine any pair of nail clippers being worth this much money this is super small and folds completely flat it also has a small , leather case for storage \( a little tight to get into but it will soften \) the clippers are super sharp and do a great job the engineering in the design is really neat and i love how it folds out and becomes a tension spring very cool but really , i'm not sure my nails are worth it
3	this is like mortar you put between to smooth out a road i think it is similar stuff , except thicker and shaded for use with wrinkles i am sure this stuff would work if you could manage to apply it only in places you wanted smoothed however we could n't and if it over shoots the depression you are trying to put it into it ends up being super hard to blend into the rest of your foundation the color was nice , and it did look great in the places it went and stayed the less we applied the easier it was to work with , but it still was not so great on younger skin so it works well , but it is a little thick for smoothing foundation \( though i guess it was smooth in its own way \)
4	this is a light , crisp fragrance that smells very strongly of grapefruit it 's a very clean almost unisex fragrance in fact , i had to double check amazon upon receiving it since the box this perfume arrives in looks more like what i 'd expect from a men 's cologne the bottle is decidedly feminine though i will add that i received a few comments while wearing this that is smelled like an older woman 's perfume not exactly the reaction i was looking for , but i still like it quite a lot
5	i have an odd tone of skin due to my mix of \( olive \) and irish english mix i am dirty blond fair , but with a ton of pink olive yellow mixed in therefore , it 's super hard to find makeup that works for me , and i have given up on cheap brands and just stuck with lancome over the years for my foundations \( which is also not a perfect match , i have to use a blend of two ! \) as a corrector stick , this works pretty darn well the color is obviously not as good as an actually color matched concealer , but that 's one thing nice about concealer it does n't have to be exact because you put it under your final coat of makeup and blend it in this dark beige worked just fine on me i think the lighter one would still be a tad better , but i just ordered it so we will see quality and use is perfect the stick worked just fine for me , you just take the lid off and twist the base to make it come out the thickness was perfect , and others complaining about the brush are just goofy it 's ideal for laying in the concealer in the corner of my eye and under and i use my fingertips to brush it out and blend it in it 's really perfect usually just one dose of it is about right for highlighting the area around my eye and getting rid of dark circles and i have a ton of dark circles right now due to a new baby with health issues , so i know it works ! ! the makeup is awesome , nice , thick and creamy and applies wonderfully it is wet but does not shine at all , very matte without looking cakey especially after being set with a touch up of my powder foundation with a kabuki brush , it 's just gorgeous i usually follow this routine lancome 's la base primer \( it 's amazing ! \) , lancome 's liquid teint foundation , then i use a highlighter for cheeks , this concealer around the eye corner , and touch up with lancome 's dual finish powder foundation and blush i know it 's expensive , so i do n't always take the time to do the concealer and highlighter as well , but it does make a noticeable difference for when you are n't just going shopping or something i generally stick to a no makeup makeup and this works pretty darn well for that
5	dj play that song is a vibrant purple magenta hue it goes on fantastically is as bright as the bottle there is more pink in the polish than i thought from viewing online , but i love the shade
4	i do n't wear cologne very often as i have very sensitive eyes and the alcohol dries them out pretty easily as such , i have to be judicious in which colognes i wear , as well as how often i wo n't compare this to the original eternity because , frankly , i 've never tried it i know it 's popular , but even though eternity now a name with the original , it should probably be on its own merits honestly , i really , really like this scent it 's much sweeter than colognes i 've used in the past to me i smell a lot of warm vanilla it could be its just how it reacts to my skin , but i quite like it i enjoy musky and citrus scents , but i'm a bit new to sweeter scents but , as i said , i really like it it 's hard to write a review on cologne because it reacts differently to different skin types all i know is that it smells good on me and , bringing it back around to my opening , its a scent i can very easily see myself wearing so long as my eyes allow me which is saying a lot , frankly
5	truth and flare is a beautiful spring color , i love it !
3	not great for oily skin
4	crown me already ! \( silver sparkle with various size glitter particles \) this polish is amazing and got tons of comments , even from a guy that worked at 's three coats are needed to get a solid diamond like glitter from the nails , but after three days it started to chip off two of my nails , even with seche vite topcoat the biggest problem i had was removal this polish simply does not want to come off , even if you use a basecoat it took nearly thirty minutes of intense scrubbing with pure acetone to finally remove the polish , and by that point my nails literally hurt it is amazing but i will think twice about wearing this by itself again this would not be good for a diamond tip french manicure as some of the sparkles are quite large it made the edges of my nails sharp and my boyfriend complained that i was scratching him i even scratched my own face a few times
3	features 1 \) it uses professional laser technology and ensures removal of unwanted hair permanently 2 \) it targets the pigment in one 's hair and permanently the hair 's ability to regrow hair by a laser of light 3 \) it is much cheaper and convenient that the laser treatment done from various well known 4 \) it is designed for smaller areas like underarms , upper lip , chin and facial hair etc 5 \) it removes existing hair and the future hair growth cons 1 \) it is quite painful while using this product it feels like sharp stinging every time 2 \) it created spots and rashes on my skin as an after effect 3 \) the battery lasts for a shorter period and has to be again
5	i have a lot of eyeshadow , but none of them really offer a true gold option most were too pink on the rose gold side , and pink does not work for my skin tone seeing as you and beauty are touting the beauty cry , go for the gold this summer ! , i was in a search for options that were to my face enter lorac unzipped gold this is truly the touch of eyeshadow for me right now it 's neutral enough for my pink edged tone , and none give me the rabbit eye look that i 've worn on my fair face the texture is blendable , smooth and even i did n't get any chalky finishes , or patchy applications all 10 were soft , but fall out was minimal for me i love the deep brown tones that work and blend perfectly with the pale yellow hued golds to note , when they say shimmer , because of the nature of golds in general , these look to be a little more on the metallic side when applied but , i personally love it i have to admit i reach for this palette most often right now it 's easy to do a simple eye for work , and then add more oomph when i get home , or go out these can be applied wet for more drama , though i do n't typically use them that way but , i have n't had any changes in texture on the powders i 've gotten damp i 've always worn them over primer , and the lorac primer is excellent i get all day wear , which for me is a full 8 hours with zero fade the price seems steep , but it 's a little less than other going palettes , and well worth it from the size and quality the mirror is also generously sized and usable i am not disappointed and will be checking out lorac for more options !
4	holy cow does this makeup brush cleanser cleanse ! one little spray starts to disintegrate the makeup from my brushes , even my eye brow brush covered in brow pomade comes completely clean every time ! it has a bit of an oily feel and a little goes a long way this makeup remover is also extremely effective on my beauty blender sponge however , i noticed that my sponge started running pink which makes me think that this cleanser is so strong it 's taking the pink dye out of my beauty blender my main complaint though , is the scent it literally smells like a strong lemon kitchen cleaner which is strange since i'm not trying to de grease my ! for the price , it is very strong and effective i would recommend this product as a good substitute for the beauty blender brand cleanser
5	my favorite ! love this polish although this specific bottle seems to chip quicker than my previous bottles of the same color
4	i really enjoyed all three fragrances , they are light and clean , and not overpowering i do wish the bubble bath would foam a bit more and result in more bubbles the bubble bath does leave my skin feeling great , however all in all a pretty good product
2	wow what is this , cosmetics \? you have the 5 star reviews supposedly by the people who work for the product line , and then a load of 1 star reviews by people , who have a different problem one of whom gives every product by this company 1 star , but still purchases the items the company offers , only to keep giving it 1 star now if i get something from a company that gets only 1 star , i probably wo n't be getting more of their products it just seems a little odd and a little hard to believe either of the reviews i also noticed that vine reviewers , who are totally , give their honest opinions and are because they are giving it 3 5 stars \( not just 1 star \) in other words giving honest reviews and which are obviously not making some people happy seriously \? \? moving on i got this product to review through the amazon vine program i love eye shadow palettes and was excited to try something new this palette is okay but definitely not worth the price it came with a travel compact as well \( a small compact to put your choice of eye shadows , blush , lipstick in \) the good the eye shadows did appear to be packed well , i did n't have much trouble with fallout the blush had decent staying power the lipstick went on nicely the case is very solid and includes a tool to swap the different trays between the large palette and the travel compact the neutral this is a mostly neutral eye shadow palette there are some greys and some mauves two of the eye shadows have a very nice gold shimmer to them most of the eye shadows are glittery there are only a few matte shadows in here so if you are a big matte eye shadow fan this is n't the palette for you the bad the eye shadows do not have much pigmentation not nearly as good as urban decay or even the balm eye shadow palettes i have the eye shadow brush included is better than the foam applicator included in most drugstore eye shadows but still not all that useful i used it once and then never used it again the eye shadow trays are different sizes which is just weird , so you can only grab certain ones for your travel compact the blush is n't very pigmented \( i love my tarte amazonian clay blush much better \) the two orange brown colors in the blush were just off and looked really strange on \( i have olive colored white skin \) there really is n't a good way included to apply the lipstick so i applied with my fingers the lipstick did n't have any staying power and it 's not very portable so it is n't easy to reapply it also was very drying to my lips the palette and travel compact are very heavy the tool to change out the palette was hard to use and i kept dropping the trays on top of other trays \( and the other eye shadows \) when i tried to change them the palette has only shallow grooves for the transfer tool and the included eye shadow brush , so they kept falling out whenever i picked up the palette to use it it was sooo irritating the travel compact has absolutely no place for a small eye shadow brush , this is really weird and makes it pretty much useless for throwing into your purse overall i would n't recommend this palette i would recommend sticking to the better pigmented urban decay eye shadows if you do want a great eye shadow blush palette the balm 's balm voyage palette is absolutely awesome and nearly half the cost of this one
3	this product feels good on my skin , leaves no residue , and has a lovely small applicator tip i enjoy using as it allows me to get the exact amount i want i trust the brand and have been using their sunscreen 45 for many years , an excellent product redermic day and night cream seems very good however , i am not sure it 's worth the price i typically buy l'oreal brightening for day and olay total effects for night time i like this cream a lot if it were less expensive i would give it four stars did i see any amazing results \? of course , not no cream will erase six decades of life my criteria are is it smooth , does it go on easily , is it moisturizing \? this product scores three out of three my rating has more to do with the price and claims
2	i wanted to love this product based on all the feedback i 've heard i have long , super thick , curly wavy hair and this stuff really weighed it down i was hoping for something a little more light weight if you have a lot of hair you might reconsider buying this product
5	this is a great color it mimics the natural raspberry color when on the nails i think this is a great color for spring it is appropriate for work or play and would even look nice while in a formal evening i particularly like butter london nail polishes because they are free of most i feel that they also make my nails healthier i would recommend this color to everyone
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	ok , i have very dry skin i am always looking for products to help with this problem and have tried a lot of products from brands like jack black and kiehl 's the common complaint is that they can leave your skin moisturized but greasy when i saw the description as oil free i decided to take a chance i did a little experiment i put the baxter product on one side of my face and my regular product on the other and went about my day to my surprise , the baxter side felt less tight and dry than the other side the one with a product that has been working ok for me for a while also , it did this without leaving a greasy or oily residue like i said , a surprise here is a twist , i was rushing out of the house and decided to use a dab of the baxter product on my hands a little went a long way and left my hands smooth , moisturized and not greasy probably not the designed use \( especially when you consider the cost \) but it worked very well on my hands i guess skin is skin ! this little 4oz tube is pretty expensive but high quality boutique products do a premium recommended for anyone with dry skin
5	great price and arrived fast
5	i love the korres lip butters and own 4 different shades this smells really nice kind of sugary and is really moisturizing it has a slight tint , but looks very natural
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	this is an excellent moisturizer its texture is heavy but it is not greasy it seems to soak right in not a miracle product and it doesnt claim to be its a solidly good moisturizer to finish up with at nighttime
4	i had this in a 2 barrel , but my old one broke so i and i'm missing my larger iron for my thick hair this one does the job , and as always i love hot tools , but wished i had replaced my 2 iron otherwise , no complaints like the replacement springs and the swivel cord makes great irons !
5	i found out about this product from my i have a lot of facial redness and acne scarring , this provides great coverage while moisturizing and providing spf protection i'm 57 and have oily skin and pimples around my nose , the thick concealers i was using was causing my skin to break out , so it 's a challenge to find products to use on my face to cover the redness this one does it i love everything but the price !
4	makes my skin so soft , and my pores appear much smaller
3	this does it 's job , but after comparing trial size versions of this and another popular product , cobaki , i like cobaki better even though it is a little more expensive and my color in cobaki is n't available on amazon
5	i was pleasantly surprised to be able to give this mineral cream foundation a try for the last year i have been trying various powders and liquids to try and find one i really liked at 50 years old , i have the lovely of slight rosacea , dark circles and visible pores not fun to try and hide i have tried smashbox , estee lauder , bareminerals , dermablend , hope in a jar and a few others in powders and liquids my favorite had been the laura geller balance and brighten face powder , but now i feel that this product with the mild moisturizing product in it , does a better job of blending onto the face i found that liquids tended to highlight pores and get shiny after awhile as for this product , borba 's anti fatigue 8 hour mineral foundation , it does a great job i suppose it is that hybrid between a powder and a liquid , the mixing of the 2 elements in the case gives it an easy to apply and stay on foundation it is by no means a heavy makeup , but does enough to give the skin a healthy look while staying matte it does not hide pores \( nothing does ! \) , but i think i can say it minimizes them , blurring their edges , while other foundations i have tried actually made them look bigger , who wants that \? ! the medium color is by no means dark , and i would imagine most people would use that unless you have very pale skin i have no noticed any shimmer in it either applying with a good brush is a must , and although it is a bit costly , if it saves me experimenting with other lines , then i am happy to continue using it i think it is also important that they do not test on animals the spf of 29 is also good to have
3	meh does n't last very long
5	i 've recently switched over to mario badescu everything for my skin care regime and every single thing works i 've tried forever to get rid of my adult acne so i'm glad i finally found something i live in the desert so it 's difficult to find something that does n't dry my skin but this surprisingly does n't dry it out i use it twice a week and follow with the healing mask to keep my skin from drying too much
5	love the color ! !
5	i love this stuff i have wavy to curly hair and really struggle with finding stuff that helps moisturize my hair but also not make it to greasy the fact that it protects my color is really fantastic i use before i go out to the pool and and i use it immediately afterwards i really helps my color from fading
5	works great
4	this cream is different in the jar , it looks creamy as i rub it into my face , it feels watery after it is absorbed , my face feels soft , nourished and hydrated pale bluish in color , it is and very light it is important to follow the directions carefully here the directions recommend massaging it into the skin for thirty seconds this seems to increase its effectiveness by stimulating the skin as it absorbs the product seeming to have no fragrance at all , a little of this cream goes a long way i have very sensitive skin that is prone to allergies many times , i am unable to use a product , due to allergies after a weeks worth of twice daily applications , i am happy to say that i have had no allergic or negative reactions at all
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	top notch works great feels good as good as they come
5	clear daughters flare ups quickly
5	this is a product i use a couple of times a week any nia24 skin care product is worth checking out this works nice with just a dab on a wash cloth , to prevent dry flaky surface skin
5	this has really helped my daughter with keratosis a lot i think i use the body wash and this lotion her arms and legs are so much smoother it 's pricey , especially for both but it lasts a long time
3	i love the original opi nail envy , but this product chips off very quickly i 've tried using this and a coat of the original , but it still chips the color is a nice nude color
5	i would describe this hand cream as thick but not creamy it comes out thick from the tube , but applies onto the hands really easily it 's odorless , which is a huge plus for me \( and probably most other males \? ! \) i have calluses and rough patches from indoor rock , and this works pretty well on smoothing them out
4	it could feel more like a scrub i do n't know that it removes many dead skin cells because it really lacks a scrubbing feeling but it smells pleasing
3	i really hate the scent of sunscreen so im glad to get my sunscreen in beauty products since the scent seems to be less sunscreen scented this one is advertised as fragrance free but it is not unscented , it is lightly scented for a sunscreen but it is still there it is a light , sheer coverage makeup so it works as a casual , everyday wear product it comes in different tints for either cool or warm skin tones i did find it a little greasy feeling and slightly tacky feeling it does make my skin look shiny
5	it 's fine i do n't use anymore
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	i am very pleased with this laura geller new york eyeliner pencil with proper prepping it lasts all day and stays put i appreciate the self sharpener that comes with it the sparkle is attractive and eye catching but not it goes on smooth without tugging and looks fantastic it is n't easy to remove except with makeup remover but it is so worth it
3	pretty color but it is really silver not gray , lighter than appears in the picture , its okay but i really needed wanted a color that was gray and a little darker
3	the first time i used this was a telling moment my teenage boy who liberally applies axe or old spice or whatever is the popular bug of the month told me that 's too strong i only sprayed myself with this once and the whole room smelled like it it 's strong and chemical and pungent and then , it died away there was no residual scent , not even a whiff of it was left i tried it many times just to see if that was an accident nope the scent thankfully dies away after about an hour it does n't even remain on my clothing it does have a hint of cucumber but other than that i do n't recognize what other scents are in this even if the scent remained , i am not a fan of this cologne
5	my husband has very sensitive skin and mild rosacea , so he 's constantly looking for skin care that will work for him he really likes the face wash because he feels that his skin is thoroughly cleansed without stripping the moisture and leaving his skin feeling dry and tight on the occasions when he 's had a goatee and needed to shave , he said that the cleanser seemed to condition the hair and made it easier to shave this cleanser is non scented and lathers nicely he 's also a fan of the moisturizer because it does n't irritate is sensitive skin and it absorbs quickly without feeling greasy he does n't use the toner for some reason it 's the one step i just ca n't get him to do , but i do use it and i love it i'm 39 years old with very sensitive skin and monthly hormonal breakouts this toner clears my skin up an removes all traces of makeup leaving my skin feeling refreshed my skin has not been irritated and i find the herbal mint scent to be subtle and pleasing to both sexes we highly recommend this skin care set
5	we ca n't go wrong with ellie can we \? i love this and so will you
5	as a beauty product lover i am always eager to try out a new mascara i have never before used a julep mascara \( or any julep product \) before this testing opportunity i have enclosed the picture of what the mascara has done for my eyes i definitely see more pop with this mascara than with my regular mascara it lifts and separates each eyelash it does not clump it does not have any odd smell to it and the wand is especially easy to use i would recommend this to anyone that has thin eyelashes or needs a mascara that just gives you that little bit of extra lift and separation of your lashes it makes me look like i have twice the eyelashes that i had really do the pic enclosed is of what i look like with regular mascara on and then what i look like with the julep mascara i am a woman in my mid thirties with sensitive skin and this mascara did not bother my eye area or irritate my skin in any way it made me look less eyed and more awake and alert \( bigger eyes \) it also did not clump or flake which is a big deal for me because that is the main problem i have with most mascaras that i try i will be purchasing this again !
3	i had a manicure and pedicure done and i asked what product they used they stated essie so i came home and wanted to see if amazon carried the product i purchased four of them i wish i had not we all know pedicure 's last longer and for the most we do not need to touch up our toes for awhile well not the case on our fingers it chipped with in two days of the manicure i had already received my products which i ordered , so i applied the chipped nails the product is ok if you have time to coat at least three x 's and wait to it dries i have inquired with others at work and they state the same thing i suggest not to buy the product unless you have time to waste applying sorry for remarks , but do not want others to be disappointed it 's better to pay a higher price than to buy a less expensive product
5	great skin product
2	one thing i notice about pca products is the smell it is strong and not nice i do n't like this toner it 's really smelly , and it is sticky after it dries up i only used it a few times the rest of the products like the serum phaze 24 , the sunscreen lotion , the facial wash phaze 1 , are all excellent
4	my wife got this brush for me on the vine program i have been using a badger hair brush for years , but would not take it anywhere we go overnight \( not that i go anywhere that much since becoming , but i \) i am accustomed to using a quality badger hair brush that has the silver tip hairs these are the preferred hairs to use from the coat of a badger for a brush this brush does not have the silver tip hairs badger hair brushes have the unique ability to not clump together very much when wet i found that this brush clumped up more than my my daily shaver brush never the less it is still far superior to a hair brush , which are terrible as far as having clumps of stuck together hairs the actual brush part itself is rather small , but adequate enough to hold enough lather to cover your face i found that it built a nice lather in my shaving soap cup , which is filled with lime scented glycerin soap the handle of this brush is fairly long as shaving brushes go , and it provided a nice feel when lathering up my face after finishing my shave i noticed several hairs had come loose from the brush , which if this continues after a few shaves will only grow worse i'm thinking that this is just part of the break in stage though time will tell , but vine requires timely reviews , so i'm giving this review now , and will make any changes if i feel they are necessary after i 've use it a bit more the brush does not come with a stand of any kind , though you could stand it with the brush up , but brushes should always be hung brush down to dry , as the longer it stays wet down near the base the more likely it is to break down the glue that holds them in place , and the more likely the hairs themselves will become damaged due to soap buildup and possible from a good shaving brush will last for years and years if cared for properly , but will quickly if not the stand i have for my daily shaving brush does work with this brush , i just think the company ought to include a cheap plastic stand which only cost about one or two dollars , on which to hang the brush to dry this brush is fine for what it 's designed for packaging up and carrying in your shaving kit just make sure it 's completely dry before closing it up and storing it in the kit i think it 's a nice brush , and as i said earlier , better than a hair brush , and i would recommend it for a travel brush a good quality badger hair brush can cost well over 100 00 and some more than 200 00 this is n't a bad product , but it 's not the best i do like it and will use it some more when i go out somewhere
3	on this one was around and some of the powder was loose elsewhere all rest was ok
4	compared to , the mustela diaper rash cream is much thinner and does n't stay on i would use this cream as a preventative like a d , but not to get rid of a diaper rash already there the ingredients are hypoallergenic and do n't bother my son
5	this is great for my rosacea skin first bottle came but they took it back no problem i have to use a toner following , but love the milky , creamy texture my skin looks great since i started using this
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	you do n't need much of this for your skin to feel moisturized and fresh not greasy feeling at all i used it daily on my face after my shower as with most of the mario badescu products i use , this is a winner will definitely keep using
5	best suntan product , bought as gift for family vacation
5	removes makeup easily and on waterproof mascara odor free , non oily what 's not to like \?
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
3	love the color ! the polish goes on kind of clumpy for a brand new polish that is the only negative and why i am not giving it a 5 star i'm a little disappointed with that , because i absolutely love this color and thought essie was the brand to get ! !
2	i only received a tiny tube of this product and really am not that impressed with it it does moisturize but so do so many other cheaper products i would n't really recommend it
5	i 'll never use a pencil again
4	i use a very small amount of this lotion and apply on my hair evenly after the shower this helps to hold hair without grease i comb in such a way it will keep hair lifted to give a more volume and it does not harden this is a good product and it is recommended
4	features pros 1 \) it has a fragrance of fresh flowers and perfume is of josie eau de 2 \) the lotion container is easy to squeeze and use cons 1 \) since it is of thin texture it does not absorb to the skin well 2 \) it does not moisturize the skin completely 3 \) it may not suit skin types that are extremely dry 4 \) it is very expensive for the price
5	item exactly as described great quality fast ship
5	oribe glaze conditions as it adds highlights and shine to my dark hair i'm very happy with the highlights , as i had been coloring my hair with nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 just for men control , 5 fluid ounce a , which did a great job of turning gray hairs black but left everything after just one treatment with oribe glaze , i could see deep shades of burgundy reflected in the sun it makes my hair looks so healthy i love it !
5	i have used this set while on a business trip the sample cleanser has lasted for two weeks , with two uses a day it is a very mild formula , milky in texture , and pleasant in scent it does a nice job removing makeup as well as gently cleansing the skin it would not work well with oily skin the night moisturizer is light and goes on smoothly a little amount goes a long way , and it works well on my skin which tends toward dry , especially when layered with the idealia glow i 've used it once a day twice a few days and there 's more than half in the small container i really like the soothing aroma slightly rose tinted the idealia glow pumps out a smaller than dime sized amount which i use on my face and neck when combined with a moisturizer , my skin looks and feels hydrated i ca n't say that i note extra glow , but it leaves my skin feeling fresh and hydrated without moving toward oiliness the samples have intrigued me to buy the product and i will continue to use the idealia glow
5	i really like this face wash , because i like to use a facial wash that has suds and is n't drying this product provides both for me i'm not sure if my face is brighter , but i will continue to use it !
5	i started using this product about two months ago and it really has improved the quality and health of my skin
4	i love the actual product it makes your face very clean and smooth and does not dry your skin like other , harsher , products it clear our pores and makes your skin look brighter this particular product is in an aluminum steel can which is not very convenient , and that is my only gripe it does come in tubes which are a lot nicer and i would recommend looking for them the company , as of recently , seems to be in a and possibly going out of business their products are disappearing from many stores i emailed the company and they said they are buying the product line back from p g and will be it to stores and online very soon hopefully this is true and it doesnt take too much time
3	products , in my experience , are some of the best , and i trust them they are made in the usa this one , though , was n't the best for me this might be a good one to get a sample of before buying because it is very expensive it 's a white lotion in a pump dispenser i use 1 2 pumps per application so there are many applications in a bottle it smells a bit of citrus but it is a fairly natural , subtle scent it goes on and absorbs immediately it does seem to tighten my skin some i would not say that it brings back natural youthful contours but that might be partially because my face is a lot more fat than when it was youthful i tried it on my hands , and that 's where i could really tell it was tightening ! it does tighten my skin and it makes me look better rested so that 's good , but , it stings it does n't cause redness , but it makes my face sting and itch especially my cheeks ! that 's where i need it the most it does n't make my face red though it feels like it does , but it leaves my skintone as it normally is
5	i was a little worried about the coloring of this product , would it show up happily no though each side is a different color , when used in a thin veil as directed , it absolutely does n't show the product on both sides is silky smooth , with pink side just giving a subtle healthy glow i used this on bare skin and another day i used it over my makeup you seriously ca n't see this product when on i have dry skin , but some larger pores on my chin and nose the peach colored side , the mattifying side , did seem to camouflage mark larger pores for a smoother appearance , applied over makeup , it does the same thing and blends effortlessly the pink side is lightly oily side , that gives your cheeks a healthy glow without adding color both sides are silky to the touch and apply silky smooth i am really impressed with this product and will make it part of my daily routine
5	the candle is gorgeous it is packed well and comes in a lovely box , suitable for wrapping as a gift where a candle might be the right thing it burns very nicely , giving off a not to bright glow the downside is that the scent is a lot stronger than other reviews suggest , and this candle is not going to work for anybody with a scent allergy no sooner did i have it out of the box that i could feel and smell the scent so , great candle if you can do scents , but not light enough for anybody who cannot do scents
5	works very good
5	this body lotion is great and i'm pretty ecstatic to discover it now it is so light and not too sweet scent is incredibly clean i love the way my skin feels after i put it on something is just so good about it i love another certain lotion with oatmeal it 's actually my favorite around the house and made by aveeno i feel this one made with wheat is very similar in the way it feels the difference is price , with aveeno you get a lot more for a lot less
5	by far the best nail strengthener ive ever used , this product has changed my life i went from breaking nails a couple times a week to a couple times a month or once a month !
4	nice scent loads of lather clean feeling when rinsed
3	its silver girls it reminds me of flat silver paint for toy models i expected depth and from this silver but nope it was just a silver maybe i 'll add as a top coat and i beat it would really pop !
5	i love nia 24 products and the face scrub is great i use several times a week to exfoliate skin and even tone
5	love it super light for the day only downfall no spf
5	my husband is the user of this he likes it and said it did not cause any discomfort to his rather sensitive skin i like the smell and think it makes his face soft it is expensive , but we both like it
4	thought it would be a little darker , but overall still a good color !
4	is a gorgeous , bright pinky coral shade that is very pigmented but easy to sheer out on the cheeks unfortunately i do not get the wear out of this that some other reviewers do i 've yet to find a blush that wears for more than a couple of hours on me though , and i suspect this has to do with my very oily skin that said it does wear longer than most other blushes on my skin the packaging of this is cute but makes me nervous because it is so lightweight and the product inside is heavy also , the pan on my blush was not even glued in so the first time i opened it it popped out and fell on the floor \( luckily it did not break \)
5	works well
5	mom likes it
3	the product itself is fine however , i hate getting a polish and finding when i use it that it 's got sparkles or is marbled there was inadequate description of the product on your website if the seller does n't provide that information , then amazon should request it
5	finally i do n't look like a clown
5	i purchased the tea tree paul mitchell shampoo a while ago and love it but like to switch it up every few shampoos so decided to give this a try i am very impressed and maybe even more in love the lavender mint smell is amazing and wonderfully soothing just a small amount works itself into a creamy lather and it washes out easily the pump bottle works well too hope these paul mitchell shampoos are never discontinued
4	anti aging serums are typically alpha hydroxy acid types or retinol types i'm not sure which this is but it 's certainly one of them it 's a gel that goes on smoothly a little goes a long way the smell is really different it 's not awful or particularly great there 's a smell in the mix that reminds me of lanolin \( if you 've used any products for breastfeeding , you may know what i'm talking about \) i 've used it twice a day for a little over 2 weeks initially i experienced the red sun burned feeling in my skin , but that has gone now and i do think my skin looks smooth and healthy i did not experience any break outs which i typically do with this type of product i will continue to use
4	i do n't use foundation on a daily basis and usually only do so for business appointments or occasions i 'd gone to sephora for a one on one session to find a good foundation match for my medium light asian complexion jouer 's luminizing moisture tint \( golden \) is great it blends easily , feels light not oily or too dry and it looks polished it stayed on and comfortable for hours it 's as good as the bobbi brown and smashbox cc creams that i use , but jouer feels even lighter
5	great ! ! ! i will use this seller again
4	i think finding the right shade of concealer or foundation online is hard i am not sure this is the right shade for me or my daughter , but going to give it a try i love the thickness of this cover creme , it will definitely do the the trick to cover up blemishes or under eye circles if you do n't like thick heavy concealer , this is not for you if you need a highly pigmented , heavy concealer , i recommend you try this one i am very happy with it , but i might need to try another shade follow instructions that come with it for application
5	i always like to use the same family of products as my nail polish i find my polish stays on longer without chips if the color gets a little dull i use another coat of top coat and the look good for several days the product line is a bit pricey but well worth it
5	i first this when i received a sample from a seller on amazon and i was hooked this leaves my hair with a super shine just what the product claims to do this is also great if you have frizzy hair , works excellent for keeping frizz away and hair soft and smooth i use this along with the shampoo and i'm very happy just be sure not to use to much or your hair may look greasy a little goes along way
5	this is a wonderful sunless self tanning gel that does n't have the yucky scent that the less expensive ones do xen tan 's light cucumber melon scented gel is pleasant and leaves a medium to medium dark tan depending on your skin tone and how long you leave it on the first time i tried it i applied it with a plastic hand and the separately available mitt on the larger , smoother areas of my body \( legs , arms , chest \) i just used the hand for my face and it turned out nice and even thanks to the tinted color of the gel i left it on for about 3 hours as i wanted to see how dark i would get in this time after showering , i had a nice , even color that looked like i 'd laid out , without the cancer risk or the red burn ! it was a bit sticky for awhile after applying , about 45 minutes before i felt comfortable putting on loose fitting clothes but it was worth it it was hard to wait the rest of the time to see the results but it is the price you must pay , unfortunately , and it is a lot less annoying than the self tanners with the weird odor my husband was surprised to see a suntanned me when he got home from work and thought i 'd been outside all afternoon thank you xen tan ! with fall here and winter on the way , it 's nice to know i do n't have to be pasty white , go on vacation , or wait until spring to have a natural looking tan this is a bit pricey but not if compared to the cost of a spray tan and you can get at least 3 or 4 body tans from one tube , and more if you do n't do your whole body this is depending on your size , of course i had a nice , natural color for the week with daily showers i did n't have stained clothing or bedding love it !
5	if i could only use one hair treatment , this would be it just comb a little bit through hair still damp gives incredible shine and sparkle love it
4	this is a really nice foundation you only need about a pea size amount to cover your whole face \( the first few times i used it , i squirted out more and wasted it \) it is not a moisturizing foundation , so if you have dry skin , make sure you moisturize first overall , i was impressed with the coverage to pick a shade online seems hard as the swatches of color provided are small and hard to compare to your skin tone
4	as concealers go , it does a fairly good job patting it on works best for coverage of dark circles and carefully applying foundation over it i 've used it over foundation as well , as a hurry up way of hiding some of the shadows or freckles
4	its just ok i do not see a difference smells good and absorbs rather quickly too not sure if i would buy again
5	the perfect shade of coral , not too peachy and not too red
5	i normally use an eye lash curler by revlon \( not expensive \) i have just kept using it , because it is simple to just buy new refills and keep using the same one i curl my eye lashes a lot i mean probably 4 or 5 times each eye before i'm satisfied i have medium length lashes , but they are blond and very fine it 's difficult to get mascara on them without clumping or weighing them down when i first tried the georgie beauty curler , i was disappointed , because it does n't open very wide this makes you take an extra couple of seconds to get your eye lashes in place correctly i was going to rate this curler a 4 because of this however , they curl my lashes so much better than my previous curler ! ! they look very similar , but these curl better i do n't know that it is because of the pad or not , but something works better i now curl each eye 2 or 3 times instead of 4 5 times one time would probably be fine , but i will have to let go of my thought process that i have to do it more than once i'm extremely happy that i can cut off a little time in the mornings every little bit helps !
5	a masculine spicy scent that i do enjoy wearing for an evening on the town i know fragrance is rather subjective , and we all have our likes and dislikes i think it would be rare that this one would not be a favorite i find that the fragrance does last , comparing to a few other reviews at least for an evening on the town for sure it would make a wonderful gift for someone very special , i know it would please me very much a very nice frosted container looks great and is one that you could leave out on the counter the more i use this the more i like it just a tad addicting i have received several compliments that does feed the just a bit
3	i have previously reviewed an individual bottle for lacoste live and liked the scent very much this review is for the gift set while the box for the gift set is colorful and attention grabbing \( though it did arrive damaged \) , it is also large and awkward the box does not need to be this big and is an example of wasteful packaging there are two toilette spray bottles included \( why not a talc or lotion , deodorant , or something other than a spray \? \) , and i really believe a better box could have been designed to house them
5	the other reviews do n't lie , this really is the best wand ever ! light , comfortable , heats up super fast , has a temperature settings , the cable swivels at the base with you as you move \( will make sense when you hold it \) and the price is amazing for the quality you 're getting
5	i originally tried baxter of california after shave balm as part of a starter kit that contained a baxter of california shaving brush , shaving cream , and this balm the balm has a pleasant citrus scent to it , but it fades quickly and will not interfere with the scent of any other aftershave or cologne you might want to use afterward i really like how my face feels after using it i usually rub some alum on my face after shaving and rinse it off right before i apply the balm just a small dab of the balm is needed , and i find one tube has lasted several months with daily usage with about 1 3 of the tube still remaining my face always feels really good afterwards , and i have experienced less shaving irritation with the balm after using it for a few weeks i have found my complexion has improved , too baxter of california after shave balm is expensive , but if you want a product that will make your face feel and look good after shaving it is worth its added cost
3	love the color ! the polish goes on kind of clumpy for a brand new polish that is the only negative and why i am not giving it a 5 star i'm a little disappointed with that , because i absolutely love this color and thought essie was the brand to get ! !
5	lovely formula glides on like butter peppermint scent and taste gorgeous pigment lasts a long time i just love this lipstick
5	amazing color ! so much depth and intensity if you own any color of cnd that would be the one it 's a good primary color and an amazing accent color
4	not terribly difficult to put on , and it comes up with a decent tan the fade is kind of , but for a few days , my legs looked great ! i 'd definitely put this on my short list for next summer
5	performs as advertised
5	excellent
4	i like this face scrub it smells really good it 's a natural exfoliant so you do n't have to worry about any of those weird plastic beads that are in many face washes i use it in the shower because it is very messy i ca n't tell how well it exfoliates , but if i put it on like a mask and leave it on for a few minutes while i'm shaving my legs or something , and then exfoliate my face before washing it off , it makes my skin feel tighter and soft
5	i got this for my , she likes it , says its easy to apply , on the upper lash line , but needs something else , for the lower lash line makes sense to me she loves jane makeup and so do i the color is perfect , not black , but exactly black brown
5	these clippers are very sharp and get the hairs with the first clip there is no painful catching or pulling they seem to be more effective with nose clipping than the ears but this is probably because you can stand in front of a mirror and see what you 're doing the stainless steel material makes for easy clean up you can use the provided brush or if this doesnt get all of the material you can the unit in warm soapy water and then dry with a paper towel the price point may seem a little high but you 're getting a german engineered precision product to use you just place the cutting end in the nose ear and squeeze the end together like you do with a spring this sets the clipper in motion and cuts the hairs this is a great gift to give to your favorite man
5	i love cnd vinylux works as promised does not damage my nails like gel does easy to apply and fast drying
5	amazing !
5	it took me a long time to find a product line that helps with my rosacea in addition to the lotion , i also use the face cream , the toner the cleanser this product line really works for me ! ! ! when i do n't use it for a couple of days , i can really tell a difference my skin starts to become itchy , red , i get a slightly burning sensation the rosacea line by pevonia is definitely an investment , as the products are not inexpensive , but i have to say , it is the only product line that gives me relief ! !
4	nice lightweight hand cream for the summer
3	feels good , smells great but after few months of usage , i still do n't feel or see much improvement , no better than my other facial creams
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
4	i like the matte look do not mix with foundation it does n't last very long
5	this is amazing stuff ! ! i love it ! ! my skin is normally very dry this year , after all this crazy cold , it 's scaly , itchy , terrible , and i 've tried so many products , soaps , etc this is the best soap i 've very used i was afraid it would be really oily , but i'm at the point i'm desperate , so i did not really care i put a hair clip in to keep my hair off skin while i up with this the first time to my it goes on smooth , slick and not at all greasy or oily , and rinses clean ! ! your skin feels smooth and silky , and with this and moisturizing with coconut oil after my shower , my skin is more hydrated than it 's been in months it was getting little bumps on the back of my arms and back , so itchy it 's all gone now ! ! my skin is healing ! this has a very light scent , is very non greasy , non oily i 've already put the shower gel in my cart as well this is worth the price for certain if you have skin issues you want to try this ! !
5	this is by far my absolute favorite foundation it 's light , airy , and feels like i'm wearing no makeup at all for someone who , like me , is n't used to wearing a lot of makeup and is just looking for a little bit of coverage and mattifying , this is absolutely the perfect product i put a little but on more t zone in the morning after my shower , and i'm golden for the rest of the day also i love that it comes off easily when i wash my face in the evening , unlike a lot of the foundations i 'll be sure to be reordering it when i run out
5	i just love love love butter london polish the quality is wonderful and the colors are so vibrant ! goes on with ease !
5	my go to for coverage for rosacea
5	my wife loves this moisturizer ! ! ! ! it is very aqua ish , in that the formula has a lot of water in it \( as opposed to a thicker moisturizer \) for me , this is too liquidy to wear during the day or under makeup , but perfect for night time moisture it sits on the surface of your skin long enough so that the moisturizer can penetrate the skin gradually over time , but not so long that it never fully absorbs your skin will thank you its fantastic just a caveat that this is a travel size cute little jar that can go anywhere with you
4	this is similar to the laroche posay bb blur it goes on very smoothly and easily blends great for a light product in the summer as it helps control the oil it reminds me of an estee lauder mousse foundation agree with others that the shades are not true to the photos you have to play around to get the right one in terms of wear and coverage , if you really need to look perfect , better off with an oil control liquid like hourglass over the bb blur
3	this serum made largely with organic ingredients and salicylic acid is high quality , but to be honest i'm confused because it makes so many claims i'm not sure who it 's really suited for on the one hand , it sounds like it 's for acne \( which i'm too old to have \) but on the other it claims to also pores , even skin tone and hydrate and have age defy results which are issues i do face so i 've tried it a few nights and if i'm going to be honest my face feels too dry , not hydrated and itchy i 've tried to compensate by applying a rich face cream over it but the itch does n't go away the bottom line for me is that i believe this may be good for younger people with acne as it has a list of ingredients suited for acne and it 's balanced with some ingredients so as to not over dry , but i just do n't like it for my mature skin for the reasons stated and it just does n't provide adequate hydration for me this is better for my teen with acne we applied it to his skin which does have acne and it tingles but feels ok to him at first , it felt like it sat on the surface of his face without absorbing but then it eventually absorbed into his skin i think the product should be more clearly defined as a less drying acne treatment with organic ingredients as i do n't think its good for mature skin yet may be excellent for my teen he will continue use and update as to his results because this is not something you can clear acne with overnight , but i do n't like it for me for the reasons above
2	i must be nothing that works for the majority of the consumers never works for me i used this , along with other mario badescu products , and nothing i saw zero change in my face
5	i am new to jack black 's products and i simply love this moisturizer ! i have used it both at night and during the day and find that it makes my skin soft and helps ease redness at my age , and in the climate that i live , i need all of the help i can get ! unlike many other moisturizers , i found i did not have to keep re applying it the cream goes on smooth , it has no strong scent so men and women can use it without it smelling perfumy the tube is just the right size to fit in a purse , cosmetic bag or backpack
3	really nice product pleasant , gentle foaming action and excellent but gentle cleansing great for a quick clean before bed makeup removal if price was lower i would highly recommend it seems to exfoliate and leave my skin surface very smooth current price point seems excessive for value related to the l'occitane brand name \? initially i found this scent pleasant after some time i now find the scent almost moldy or ish an unpleasant smell i am not sure if this is due to of the product , or if i originally just talked myself into liking the scent because of my love of l'occitane perfumes ! ! either way , the smell is likely to be unpleasant for some users , and it may be wise to use your bottle very quickly
5	i have very sensitive skin so it 's been a challenge for me to find suitable sunscreens for that reason , i am thankful to have discovered anthelios clear skin which i 've found helps protect my skin from uv damage without irritating my skin anthelios clear skin is intended for facial areas so a relatively small amount goes a long way it seems to me the people who have formulated anthelios have done their i believe the reasons why anthelios agrees with me is because it 's oil free and is made with la roche posey thermal spring water anthelios features cell shield which is a patented uva and uvb screen altogether , i 've found anthelios to be an effective sunscreen that allows me to enjoy more time in the outdoors without the risk of sun damage i highly recommend anthelios clear skin to everyone
5	i ca n't believe i have never reviewed this i recently pulled a several years old tub out of my stash to use in desperation from a recent break out and could n't remember why i stopped using it i'm going to address what i feel are the main complaints about it and my opinions smell it smells like sulfur which if you have never used it , can smell like or a book of matches if you are used to sulfur , it should n't be a huge deal i personally have a sensitive nose , my friends call me the hound , i can tell you what you ate for breakfast i also suffer from headaches caused by scents that being said , the smell does n't bother me , and no one has ever complained about it to me , but it does last a while some people smell the in this , which smells like car or something similar that is the runny brown stuff that may separate and sit at the top which a few people have had issues with \( mario says just it up \) i 've never seen it separating though personally the container it 's in a tub most people do n't enjoy this aspect i imagine it was chosen because the consistency of the product is so thick that it would be impossible to get all of it out of a tube this definitely would not work with a pump tubs can be , if you are not a good hand washer , or if you have long nails or fake nails , then you should use a , qtip or spatula to remove the product consistency dry super dry i 've had many samples of this \( i picked one free sample up every time i bought the drying lotion which is hg for me \) and eventually i bought an actual full size of it which has lasted me years but even new , they were all extremely thick and dry i do n't have anything to compare them with except maybe clay it 's very hard to spread but the product is called drying cream , so i'm not going to complain that it 's dry some people have said this product is creamy , so ymmv but i 've never seen it creamy i 've never had a problem with it wiping off while i'm sleeping eventually it gets drier and drier in the tub but it still works if it 's , you can try to add a little water to bring it back to life \( in your hand not in the jar because , germs \) i 've had my full size jar for years without it becoming solid but the samples seem to dry up after a few months , especially if you leave them open by accident like i did a few times lol causes a rash \? not for me some people maybe be sensitive to any one of the ingredients a lot of people have sulfur allergies lemon can be very irritating and it usually is for me but not in this product the other ingredients may cause a problem for you here are the ingredients water \( aqua \) , zinc oxide , aloe \( aloe barbadensis leaf juice \) gel , cetyl alcohol , lemon \( citrus medica \) extract , sulfur , , palmitate , , polysorbate 80 , titanium dioxide , \( and \) propylene glycol does it clog pores \? does it cause more acne \? i do n't know i can only tell you everyone 's skin is different i have oily skin and large pores all over my face this product has never made anything worse for me it has never clogged my pores or caused more acne concealer really \? this can only be used as a concealer if you are extremely pale , which i can get away with if i do n't have a tan i am fair to light skinned medium in the summer does it work yes , for me it works it works best on those bumps i tend to get on my forehead or temples which are usually from hair products or face wash or something that is clogging my pores or irritating me those bumps respond to nothing except time , or this it also works for me when a product or food causes me to get what i call a whitehead rash this is when you get a lot of teeny whiteheads that are in usually between my eyebrows , and in the area where people get smile lines \( do n't know what the area is called \) these whiteheads can sometimes be itchy , they are very easy to pop but they come back what seems like immediately and more pop up each day until my skins irritation allergy reaction naturally stops which for me is about a week or more i feel like popping them just makes them spread so if they are tiny enough i leave them alone i get these usually from chemical sunscreens , products with irritating essential oils \( ironically just like this product has haha \) , or when i eat food i'm allergic to how i use it overnight as a spot treatment , it works best if you rub work it in well , it needs to really have contact with the pimple from all angles i have used it over larger areas with a thinner layer sometimes if i have a bunch of tiny pimples or bumps this usually shows improvement overnight but may take a few nights this product is best used consistently i have personally seen it dissolve small whiteheads \( filled pimples \) completely with one or two applications , which is amazing to me it can be drying , if you keep applying in the same spot day after day would i buy again or recommend \? i have and will continue to do so
5	my husband really likes this shower gel it 's great that it also works as shampoo ! he likes that it lathers and rinses off well it does n't take much each use , meaning it will last longer than the average body wash the scent is pleasant , without being overwhelming its scent is in the men 's cologne realm overall , this is a very nice , luxurious body wash !
4	i really like this nail polish all essie colors are amazing this one lasted a long time however , when i purchased it , i thought it was a dark pink it goes on a very dark red i love the color , but it was not what i was looking for if you are looking for a dark pink , do n't choose this one if you are looking for a burgandy , i definitely recommend it !
4	the concealer stick works well for dark under eye circles it 's not much lighter than the concealer stick i 've found that after i apply it , it works best for me if i just blend the edges so it blends in with my foundation , because if i try to smooth over all of it , it disappears it has a nice feel to it and is easy to apply
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
3	nowhere does it say these are matte lipsticks ! i always go to the website if i plan to buy lipstick online i find that comparing the color swatches from 2 or more sites helps me get a better visual idea of what the actual in person color is lorac 's website clearly states these are opaque , matte lipsticks information that is not given on the amazon site anywhere that i can find also , comparing department store photos to lorac photos to amazon photos makes them all look wildly different i will stick with armani for my mattes and look elsewhere for moisturizing lipstick
4	this conditioner is priced as a luxury hair care product the packaging is certainly lovely and the conditioner is effective in creating softness and shine the conditioner works well enough but to be honest , i did not find any significant differences from the salon quality conditioners i regularly use \( redken matrix \) the conditioner worked well and certainly looked and felt luxurious performance wise it was about the same as the salon quality conditioners i regularly use
5	i do n't know why essie stopped selling this in drugstores , but i absolutely love this color seller was prompt great great wedding nail color
3	as someone that has owned a clarisonic device since the first year that they hit the market , i'm so disappointed in this it could possibly be that i received a demo that was not quite ready for market , because i ca n't imagine that clarisonic , a company with a reputation for quality and innovative skin care , would release a device the original clarisonic has an handle with a stand the smart profile as well as the mia are designed with an easy to grip handle in order to get the footprint smaller , and perhaps to make it more gender neutral , the mia fit model is more bullet shaped and rests comfortably on its own little disc charger not quite as comfortable to hold as you are cleansing your face , but probably not enough to be a deal breaker as with all models , the mia fit is waterproof a big plus to the clarisonic line is the fact that you can take it in the shower , or rinse it under a running tap , without any damage to the unit in addition , every model that i have owned or used has had a nice long battery life between charges not only does this unit not hold a charge as well , there is also a design flaw that women in particular will find more than a little annoying the button to turn it on must be pressed extremely hard in order to get the unit to operate i'm not able to do it with my fingertip it requires the bottom of your toothbrush or tweezers to press the button enough to get it to turn on i have long and strong almond shaped fingernails , so i'm able to use my thumb nail to turn it on , but each time one risks getting a broken nail yes , it is that difficult over the years , i 've also invested quite a bit in brush heads , so this review also needs to cover the brush heads you might be tempted to buy replacement heads that are not from the clarisonic company you can find on amazon , ebay , woot , and other if you are really particular about your skin , you might want to rethink getting them from these sources part of what you 're paying for is the rounded tip on each bristle that 's also why you want to replace the heads periodically the cheap knock are just like cheap toothbrushes in that the bristles are not shaped for optimal and effective cleaning without damage if you 've never owned a clarisonic device before , you 're going to be thrilled with how far your cleansing lotions or soaps will go when using one of these you might be used to using a dollop of cleanser , but on a clarisonic , you will only need to use a fraction of that dollop you 'll get the same results as the sonic action encourages your cleanser to up there is one more thing i need to mention that is very important your face is not like the kitchen sink scrubbing harder does not equal a cleaner surface when it comes to a clarisonic and your skin , a light touch is actually much more effective the bristles and the sonic action do the work a light touch allows the bristles to clean each pore more effectively if you have large pores , a clean pore will always look smaller and that , my friend , is why i have used and continue to use clarisonic devices i have large pores on my nose , and a clarisonic is the closest thing to a miracle when it comes to making them look smaller i highly recommend clarisonic devices , perhaps just not the mia fit
5	i do n't use it , the husband does but i love it smells so good feels so european , and looks so fancy in our bathroom much needed change from the ole barbasol \( actually it was \) bought on a whim because i read somewhere that it sells out immediately , and naturally that meant we just had to have it
5	love this serum it has helped my skin look radiant
5	i have tried many different kinds of concealers on a age spot which is in the corner of my right eye \( towards the scalp \) the shading of this spot is such that it makes my eye look from a distance i have gone to dermatologists , used fading creams and even it i was told by the dermatologist that the pigmentation is very deep on this spot and will probably never go away \( just something i have to live with \) i have tried other concealers and have either seen no difference , a difference that only lasts a short time , or it appears cakey if i apply to much this new la roche posay is wonderful first , it has a great like applicator which makes it super easy to control where and how you put it second , it lasts me all day and i do n't even see the spot when i am looking closely i have to say this is one of the best items i have seen on amazon vine and will be a continued customer for this stick once my initial pencil is gone
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	i was in nordstroms when they were having a jack black products i bought a bunch of great stuff but the lip balm was easily the best in the bunch it has a pleasant minty taste it 's not greasy or oily and actually makes your lips feel better in no time at all i used to use couple of other products but retired them to my night stand , keeping this product in my pocket exclusively the only \( and the reason for only 4 stars on a 5 star product \) was the weak plastic tube packaging my tube cracked and leaked in my pocket i had to use scotch tape to repair and get the last bit out of the tube aside from that , this is a great lip balm that works better than anything else i have tried
5	it was the first nail polish that dried quickly and did n't smear as others have i 'll buy it again
5	most women want a radiant lit from within healthy looking glow but unless you 're in your 20 's that can be a challenge if you 're in your mid fifties it 's pretty much impossible without a little help i have read a lot of beauty magazines and followed their advise to the letter i have spent way too much money on products that promise to give me that healthy glow i had 35 years ago but do n't deliver and , i can tell you from experience that there is a fine line between a dewy healthy glow and a face that looks shiny and oily so , i was looking forward to trying this product but at the same time not really expecting much i was surprised at first , i just tried using it as a highlighter , dabbing a little on my cheekbones it gave me a subtle shimmer without looking obvious and glittery face it , glitter is something best left to teenagers and 20 something party girls then i tried it all over my face and ! soft , dewy lit from within glow without looking oily i have tried so many luminizing products in the past that failed i really do n't know what jouer does that is so different but whatever it is , it works and you ca n't argue with that
5	this is the kind of gift you give only to the very special man in your life it does n't come across in the picture , but these tools are heavy , durable , and absolutely stunning best of all , it does come in a sturdy black gift box , and then the tools are in a beautiful brown leather case \( zippered \) i will have to check to see if this company is like tweezerman 's in that they have free grooming tool sharpening for life , but i can certainly see these lasting a lifetime this set reminds me of something james bond would carry in his , because it 's just so rich and luxurious looking my husband has already hidden his because he saw me the cuticle pusher the stick is very well crafted and the are deep so that it only takes a few swipes to neatly file a nail instead of filing away for a minute or so i ca n't say enough about how pleased i am with this set
5	amazing color stays on very well for about 10 14 days , i use it for 5 months and ca n't get enough of it is that red that goes with everything , very classy
5	this is my go to ! i use the all the time and it is great ! i have a fancy blow dryer and straightener , and this is just great for a curling iron i have think hair and use about 330 degrees i over the cord once when it was in a storage holder and about broke my neck and it bent the connector from the handle to the barrel i bent it back and went about my life and never had an issue !
4	i should have from the name that golden would be a little yellowish , but that 's easily remedied with a dusting of bare minerals this product gives a luminous sheen and is slightly on the greasy side , but as i have dry skin , that works ok for me however , i see this as possibly being a bit too slick and slimy for summer use it does n't seem to mesh well with perspiration , and can be a bit muddy and streaky when the weather gets warm but it 's good for cooler , drier weather , and i 'd recommend it for those with dry or normal skin not good for oily skin
1	i really wanted to like this makeup i 've heard raving reviews about this brand and have seen their expensive products at ulta but never tried them due to the price i used this as directed and it 's just not for me i have very pale skin that is oily i still felt like this left a white , powdery tint to my skin and it did n't set my make up very well my make up did n't last any longer than it normally does , definitely not the 16 hours that is claimed i looked at the ingredients and all that 's in it as talc i'm not sure why a container of talc costs so much money
5	awesome product fast shipping thank you ! ! !
5	i purchased the luna for oily skin and have really enjoyed it i am a bit of a face brush junkie i have clinique 's version and an old standby the feature i like most about this product is that it is easy to clean no need to buy 30 brush heads like the other brands that i use it 's also left my skin feeling really soft and clean i absolutely recommend i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review
5	xen tan is the best , and i love this xen tan transformation ultra weekly tan it smells pleasant \( lightly fruity \) , it 's easy to apply and produces natural and stunning results this tanner is versatile and can produce a range of shades depending on how long you wait to rinse after application just leave it on from 45 minutes to 3 hours and rinse depending on whether you want a light , medium or deeper tone color continues to develop for 10 hours for my fair and untanned skin , at about one hour it 's a perfect time to rinse this tanner gives me a natural light to medium tone this tanner has an olive undertone that seems perfect for my skin tone , and i love the natural healthy look this tanner gives my skin without any streaks a mitt is recommended for an even application , though i apply this tanner with my hands and it still comes out even the color lasts all week and fades evenly and gradually i definitely recommend getting a xen tan tanner there are a number of awesome ones this transformation ultra weekly tanner works great , and i love that it provides the option of going for a lighter , medium or deeper tone depending on how long it 's left on before rinsing nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href xen tan mousse intense weekly tan 4 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 xen tan mousse intense weekly tan , 4 fl oz a nbsp was my favorite before trying this transformation tanner as i really love its yummy vanilla scent , it 's a leave on tanner that dries quickly and does n't require rinsing and my fair skin consistently turns a natural looking golden tone every time but it 's a close call now that i 've tried this tanner as they 're both awesome , and i highly recommend this xen tan transformation ultra weekly tan too
5	it is one of the best creams for keeping your skin bright and moist without being greasy i use it every day
3	i am not sure i understand this product i know it is n't a sun screen , but it is n't for a sun burn either it is to help you cool off , and to look sparkly i was under the impression this was for after you spent a day in the sun , and wanted something to enhance your skin after you had a nice glowing effect i feel this is overpriced if it soul purpose to make you glittery it has a nice smell and i am sure it has additional properties , i just have n't fully understood what to do with this product would i buy another , no
4	good product but feel not so well
5	i love the scent of this candle not flowery at all and the liquid amber and rum scents i love how the house smells when burning this candle superb and elegant without being overpowering
5	great product
4	shade matching is difficult i have no problems with dermablend coverage or staying power my problem covering multiple small has been a challenge finding correct shades i'm different shades on lower legs and lower arms which have different sun exposure and coverage i do better with a 's assistance with initial shade matching purchase then ordering thereafter via amazon would be a breeze
5	i have sensitive skin i tried the test behind my ear but forgot to wash off the peel i had no issues with my skin behind my ear despite leaving the peel on for way too long i washed my face and applied a thin layer of peel on my face and neck i left it on for ten minutes , as instructed , and washed it off i had no rash or redness at all i have not noticed a vibrant look to my face yet , but my skin did feel refreshed and i intend to keep using this peel until i run out of it i have not tried any other products like peels before , so for a first experience , i was pleased recommended !
2	this serum is very oily too oily for a serum it 's very slick on the skin and goes on more like a layer rather than absorbing right in it takes quite a while for it to absorb , and actually , i do n't feel like it ever fully absorbs no matter how lightly a i apply it my skin feels oily and slick until i wash it off such as if i apply it in the morning , it 'll stay greasy feeling all the way into the evening night unless i wash my face sooner than that i do n't have many wrinkles aside from a few tiny ones at the corner of my eyes , but i did n't see any improvement in those i did n't think my skin looked better or worse in general , except for the fact that using this serum made me break out in tiny pimples on my upper lip i would n't buy this due to how oily it is and the lack of any kind of benefit from using it
4	do n't overly spray this or otherwise you will be leaving your aroma everywhere you go it is very overpowering if you spray too much , however used in small amounts the scent is just right it has a bold masculine musky aroma which is not sweet or light the scent will dissipate in time but it will linger on the body when you come in close proximity of it just like any body spray does my husband prefers using body sprays instead of colognes because it is faster and easier to use also the cost of using body sprays is much cheaper than buying a bottle of cologne and you still get the same results use in fast quick sprays on wrist , chest , behind your ears areas on your body the fragrance will last longer dries quickly and remember spray too much
2	the primary reason that i am disliking this is the odor it has a weird , smell i ca n't decide if it 's more aqua or shaving cream , but it 's unpleasant and slightly stranger and very non girly and not attractively masculine and it lingers wise , it feels completely different that the other dr brandt serum i 've tried this is more of a light lotion , somewhat thick instantly into the face , yet does n't seem to really moisturize also , when followed with moisturizer , the combination felt a touch minty tingly i do n't like it i do n't like it at all
5	it 's not as bright as the picture it 's like a neon grass green in reality and i ca n't get enough of it ! it 's such a unique color a must buy for the polish obsessed !
5	beautiful color
3	i was hoping i would n't have to wear foundation , but this is so light i have to use both i wo n't buy again because i have sunscreen i was trying to get rid of one step ! if you do n't need a lot of coverage , this would be a great product to have
5	like product
4	the xen tan transformation ultra weekly tan is a bit different than most self tanners you apply the lotion then depending on how dark you want your color , you wait anywhere from 45 minutes to three hours to let it develop before washing it off this makes it the most complicated self tanner i have used and takes a real commitment to getting a decent result the end result was a nice , rich color but for me not worth the time consuming application process the cost is also a even though this is a quality product i would use this in anticipation of a special event but it 's too much work to use as my regular self tanner the quick drying time of the xen tan mousse fits my lifestyle much better with comparable results
5	the menthol feels great on this , but more importantly , it contains the most popular active ingredient that is proven to work against acne , salicylic acid it does a good job of clearing up my skin and it does n't dry me out a little goes a long way
4	i 've tried obagi products before and their skin care regime has dramatically changed my face more evenness in pigmentation and smoothness so i wanted to know it this eye brightener works \? after having used for the past week and a half i do notice that under my eye it appears whiter dramatically \? maybe a shade or 2 lighter this product only contains half an ounce it is pumped out in a milky gel that is easy to apply i would recommend at night before bed for best affect it also claims to reduce puffiness , this it true to an extent probably due to the moisturizing effect of the gel which is very gentle for the under eye however , i stopped using the product for a few days and under my eyes seemed return to a more normal state this does work although not as powerfully as their other skin care systems however , not sure if there are long lasting effect seem like you must continue use of the product daily for results
5	vichy ideal soleil is definitely the best face sunscreen i 've ever used vichy is a european manufacturer known for its advanced skin care products i believe this excellent sunscreen is an essential for everyone who wants to minimize damage from sun exposure ideal soleil is very fluid i like the applicator which allows for just the right amount of sunscreen to be dispensed unlike some facial sunscreens that turn my skin white , ideal soleil works into my skin it 's practically undetectable the sunscreen has an agreeable scent , too what i value most is the benefit of a moisturizer that does a great job blocking out harmful sun rays including uv yes , ideal soleil is priced higher than most ordinary , run of the mill sunscreens but i think it 's well worth it the applicator means there 's no waste and since the product is applied only to the face a relatively small amount goes a long way more than anything else , using ideal soleil means that outdoor activities are more enjoyable i do n't have to worry anymore about the sun 's ill effects on my skin 's health and appearance that 's a very good thing i highly recommend ideal soleil to everyone
5	this stuff is brilliantly weird i do n't really like the smell but it goes away after it has been applied it truly works overnight to help diminish acne i have been using it for a week with the mario badescu enzyme cleaner and i adore both products
3	i thought the color would be more on the pink side , but it had a slight orange undertone at least on me which was not flattering at all
5	this my sisters favorite perfume so it was a gift
4	been using this for weeks it comes out like a bubbly gel but it lathers up and cleans well it has a rather strong smell i feel it really removes the oil but leave my skin dryer than usual after using in regards to acne , my son started using it so far nothing dramatic has happened he does n't have a lot pimples though , maybe about 5 across the forehead and face but he likes the feeling of cleanliness after washing his face
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
3	i really like what the redermic r and how it works , and i believe my skin is a little improved however , as i mentioned in my review of redermic c , it has such a strong scent that i ca n't use it every night like the redermic c , the smell tones down after about 20 minutes , but in that time i can develop a headache i would love to find this product unscented
5	i'm tired lol i 've been on a long journey \( ok , a few weeks \) to find a new foundation i'm 50 , my skin is different and the once great everyday minerals \( olive tones \) is making my pores and rougher texture more noticeable i'm half japanese and half caucasian and it 's a pain for find the right color for me ! everything is either pink or orange on me ! well i 've look high and low end trying to find something that would work for me liquids and powders , both loose and pressed cc and bb 's and all in between ! bought this without doing any research at my local mall my first color was a bomb , too orange in the natural light they replaced it with golden glow after many test wears and having the family tell me what they thought i think i found my foundation pros very fine milled and does not show fine lines and pores , really softens and smooths out the skin coverage is very buildable color is not pink or orange ! very yellowish in tone cons yep , it 's a pricey one my suggestion is that if at all possible buy first at a store to find your color match lots of different colors in the pressed powder
4	beautiful coverage that does n't look or feel heavy this shade was a little lighter than i was expecting , but still workable , especially with a little bronzer the coverage is medium and it lasts all day with a little setting powder \( the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dermablend loose translucent setting powder for up to 16 hours of coverage original 1 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dermablend loose translucent setting powder for up to 16 hours of coverage , original , 1 oz a nbsp is an excellent powder to use with is or any foundation \) the finish is matte , but not flat looking overall , this is a great long wear foundation for normal to oily skin
5	great
5	helps discoloration and gives you a polished look all while protecting the nails
4	this is a premium nail polish that is formulated without camphor , dibutyl phthalate , formaldehyde , formaldehyde resin and toluene it is more than just a black nail polish when painted over another polish , it cracks making some cool patterns for summer it look terrific applied over white or light it is quite dramatic when placed over red or orange but i was n't especially impressed when used alone the polish is quick drying and seems to last while naming polishes after international is a clever idea , frankly i found the name objectionable and whack is crack reminded me of the late whitney 's houston 's interview with where she said crack is whack , stating that people would not have to resort to a street drug like crack i may be optimistic but i assume that most people realize that the city of houston is not named after whitney and for what it is worth , neither the color or the texture the spirit of houston , a city i have visited many times that being said , this polish will help you achieve a fashion forward look i usually just buff my nails , a habit developed after dealing with the disastrous after effects of a year or so of acrylic nails when i use polish it is usually clear or neutral colors although i do miss the color and i enjoyed with the acrylics still it is fun to play with color and texture this polish does not contain objectionable chemicals , is quick and easy to use and when used with other colors provides a fun yet classy look
5	great stuff ! ! ! ! simply put , great stuff my face felt so replenish after using i follow up with billy liquid sand which is simply amazing
4	i have colored and highlighted hair with dry ends the oribe beautiful color shampoo and conditioner help my hair to look shiny and healthy more so than most other brands i have used
5	i 've used mario badescu skincare for about 10 years now love it and will never switch to anything else the product i 'd most brag about the vitamin c serum it keeps me looking much younger than i am and is the most effective product i 've ever tried for keeping my melasma at bay when i ran out of the last bottle the spots came back slowly but surely and much darker a true test of its efficiency i highly recommend all mb products they give you excellent results for a great price
3	i was excited to try this product because i have purchased other products from skyn iceland and been very satisfied when opening the packaging , i was happily surprised with the metal applicator , because it really feels cold and helps to refresh and de puff the under eye area i like to use it without squeezing out any product , and just gently press along the puffy areas the product itself is good , but leaves a few things to be desired first , the formula is smooth and gel like upon application , but dries down completely so much so , that i felt i had to remove it before applying concealer this can be a pro , because it seems like it sucks the puffiness out of the under eye bag , giving it an almost tight feeling so , it did my puffy , tired , morning bags but the con to it drying down so well is that it leaves the area , well , kind of dry with a light film i feel these problems can be lessened by using less of the product it seems the other reviewers have also said that a little dab will do ya take that advice seriously and the results are much better in terms of illumination , i did find that it was illuminating , but in a very , very natural way i did n't think it was obvious at all it does n't add anything in terms of actual coverage , so i would n't get by using this alone i also want to mention that this is no eye cream , and does n't claim to be i expected it to be somewhat moisturizing because most under eye products are , but it wo n't replace your moisturizer by any means as i said above , it is actually slightly drying \( and i have oily skin \) if you have very dry skin and dry under eyes , i would n't buy this i will continue to use this over eye cream , and only the smallest amount if you actually apply it from the applicator , you 'll likely use too much i will continue to use this but just squeeze a very small amount out and tap it under my eyes with my fingers , then go over it in a pressing motion with the metal tip
4	this is a good , heavy duty curling iron it heats up quick , and curls well i like the textured wand , which i 've never seen before , that keeps my hair from slipping
5	this is a great set for a new baby as it includes four great products for bathtime mustela is a great brand i trust and love that they came out with four plant based skincare products for sensitive baby skin they also emphasis that you can use the box as a box but honestly i would n't have a use for it and would just recycle it the bottles are full size and since you only need a little they should last awhile you get a bath wash , bubble bath , no rinse cleansing water \( perfect for in between freshness \) and a body lotion the scent is clean and light i did notice an expiration date on my bottles but they were almost two years out
2	nice color , but it does n't last as long as it claims chips within 2 or 3 days i tried with and without a base coat and it was the same story wo n't be purchasing again
2	love essie , however this color got very thick and dried out rather quickly only was able to use it twice not to happy
5	dermablend makes different strength products to meet specific skin camouflage issues some conceal almost anything and some are lighter formulations made to cover less pigmented skin issues this is a medium coverage foundation with broad spectrum spf 25 protection it works best on red and light brown discolorations but its not designed to conceal darker marks it successfully concealed a small red mark and a couple light brown age spots after application it dries quickly i rubbed at the covered spots quite vigorously to see if i could remove the foundation but the make up was and the spots remained concealed the consistency is smooth but thick i used a sponge to apply and the liquid went on evenly make up wipes worked well to remove the foundation a little goes a long way , so squeeze the tube gently to avoid wasting product this is a heavier consistency than what i usually wear and i have noticed that when make up contains titanium dioxide \( used for sun protection \) it seems to negatively affect the texture so it is a surprise it blends so well no fragrance or sticky feeling and there is no the skin it has a matte appearance the color is a medium beige with yellow undertones it is just a shade darker than my skin tone but after application looked quite natural the product is effective at what it is designed to do finding the correct color is the trick although they do blend well if skin tone falls between two shades excellent
4	i got the tria beauty hair remover laser 4x for my wife , since i have no unwanted hair here are her observations after the first use the directions are lengthy and very thorough sometimes a little , but its really important to read all of it to prevent injury there were several things i did n't know , such as , its for ears , eyebrows , or directions say you can do the bikini area , but that must mean high on your thighs i am disappointed about the eyebrows but my daughter and i found it quite easy to use on our upper lips and and expect good results , as we are fair skinned with dark hair we will update this post as we continue the three month treatment period men cant use it on their beard and mustache areas because their hair is too dense \( i know that from reading the booklet \) but womens facial hair is fair game not on moles or areas with dark pigment , though using the machine was quicker than reading about it operation is intuitive the device beeps to let you know when to move it and it was relatively pain free you get to choose the level of intensity and control the pain the directions say it may feel like a rubber band snap , which i was not keen to feel on my upper lip we did n't experience that , but we did both experience a little bit of heat here and there you can always decrease the intensity level the instructions tell you how to start low and work your way up to avoid pain it wo n't work for white , red or blonde hair and it may burn people with dark skin if you have dark skin , research carefully before you buy the machine wo n't unlock until you let it check your skin tone to determine if you can use it safely instructions say the battery may run down with use , but we did two upper lips , necks and without there is a fast charge mode if you do run out in the middle of a job the packaging looks like a spa in a box obviously , this device is not for everyone because of limitations by hair and skin color and hair density and the dangers of using a laser around the eyes these are things you need to be aware of before spending a substantial amount of money on a hair removal laser device
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	best lip balm i 've every used i apply it daily after showering
3	this powder foundation is probably best for more oily type skin than what i have i have combination skin with a few dry patches and a few oily places through the t zone while i found this foundation worked fairly well on my oily t zone , it looks blotchy on the rest of my face which i did n't like as far as build ability of the foundation it was good as long as it was in the more oily places one thing i also did n't like was that this product \( at least the one i got \) did n't even come with a sponge to apply it i usually do n't use powder foundation , so my usual foundation i just use my fingers to blend it in i had to go out and purchase a sponge just to try this , which was a pain , wish it came with a sponge at least one thing that surprised me was that for a powder foundation , this had good coverage for large pores overall , i wo n't be switching from my usual foundation , as i prefer liquid foundation , but this one would be good in a pinch or for traveling touch ups as it fits nicely in a small purse i would n't recommend as a regular foundation for drier skin
5	i got this for my wife to use and she said it is very easy to use it comes in s nice little compact with a mirror on the back of the lid she also said that it is a nice color \( \) and that it stays on throughout the day like it should it is a very well made blush and she liked it
3	first off , i do want to say that if i were rating these on blade cut quality alone , they would , hands down , be 5 stars they cut evenly , quickly , and cleanly i honestly did n't realize how shoddy standard drugstore type clippers were before using these so , if nail clippers are designed to do one thing \( well , two if you count the file \) and they do it beautifully , why the rating \? i do n't care what kinds of design these things won , they are flat out awkward to use they 're bad enough on my own fingernails and nearly impossible for me to cut my child 's nails with the part that pops out and then back in to make the lever loves to slip out just enough to make it not close all the way besides the , there is also just the way these feel in the hand the bottom is n't a solid piece , so if you do n't hold it just right it is uncomfortable and they 're small and i have small hands so , i would say that for design i would give these a 1 star , for blades , a 5 star , so an overall of 3 however , unless you just have an awful time getting clippers to cut through your nails , i could not recommend these
5	all the look , feel and performance of a precision designed , high quality product it 's hard to imagine any of these 3 tools could be made any better the scissors close easy and smooth yet you can feel the blades just touching all the way up and down the length of the blades , making a nice , clean cut the slightly curved scissor tips allow you to get into tight spots cut what you target the nail file has a stiff blade with evenly dispersed metal sand with the perfect density of coarseness does n't look like it will ever wear down the tweezers are that rare find that seem to be able to grab even the smallest of hair and be able to firmly grip it as you pull it out i do n't know why it 's included in what appears to be a nail grooming kit , but it 's the one thing i needed most the black case is thick enough to last forever and has a nice , smooth black low cut felt lining the black crystal badge is nothing special , but if it 's a gift , i guess adds to the effect is it worth the cost \? well , they definitely are the best tools you can find , and if there 's someone on your list that already has everything , and you can afford it , it might be a nice addition to their collection i would say it 's good as a travel kit , but i'm afraid some vigilant airport security guard might consider the tools a risk
5	i'm a redhead with very sensitive skin and this caused no irritations whatsoever i mainly apply this under my eyes along with other foundation , it seems to camouflage well and works nicely with many different types of brand foundations as well i use this three times a week , it is definitely my go to concealer since it has such a slim and compact design , it 's very easy to slip in \( or even back pockets \)
5	i 've been using the toppik keratin fiber spray for almost 2 years now and the fiberhold spray is a must to hold the keratin fibers in place regular hair spray does not even come close i make sure never to run out of the toppik fiberhold spray ! ! !
5	this really does fill in the ridges although i have pretty smooth nails it is more for my toenails which seem to be less smooth than my fingernails i like all o p i products thus far with the exception of the matte finish
5	this is the best nail polish out there period it is free of chemicals , wears really well and has really cool colors what else can i say \? the only nail polish i will buy
3	it 's just lip gloss the color was too much like the color of bubble gum i received this from the vine program and it was free i would never pay 20 for this lip gloss it was nothing special
4	very nice , that i ordered it again for my wife 's thinning hair
5	it looks deep pink but on me , it 's more of a pinkish red with more red than pink i bought it because i love deep bright pink shades for but this is a pretty shade , compliments my skin tone and looks so glossy with a jelly like appearance no complaints
5	wife will only use opi nail lacquer
2	i do n't have many wrinkles , but a few are forming around the mouth area ive been impressed with other vichy products , and thought this might help the box touts , instantly skin appears dramatically smoother and plumped and in eight weeks youthfulness is visibly improved my first application burned and shortly afterwards my upper lip area something akin to using a bad hair removal and patchy skin i was glad i had no plans for the day this is the first time i 've used a retinol this to be expected \? even worse , that area looked even drier and tighter as the day went on i did n't think my skin was sensitive , but im afraid to try this product again i followed directions , used it sparingly and applied to a clean face
3	i compared baxter 's hard cream pomade to their nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href soft cream pomade dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 \( soft \) cream pomade a nbsp as well as the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href hard water dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 hard water a nbsp and nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href soft water dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 soft water a nbsp pomades they 're all surprisingly different from each other , despite their similar sounding descriptions the water pomades are much more like a hair gel or product , and the soft cream pomade is much more like a traditional hair pomade that is , it 's a kind of thick hair oil or grease this one , the hard cream pomade , is basically a wax its main ingredients are beeswax and lanolin , and the waxy consistency and oily smell are consistent with that it feels heavy and waxy in the hand , without the goopy , plasticky , consistency of the water pomades , and though the cream softens as your hands warm it , it 's still much thicker and waxier than the soft , greasy cream pomade it feels heavy and a bit sticky in the hair , and it and clumps hair considerably while not feeling rigid like a gel i personally prefer the lighter , drier feel i get from a light application of the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href soft water pomade dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 soft water pomade a nbsp to this hard cream product , which feels a bit clumpy and waxy to me but if you 're looking for a more natural , oil restoring , waxy spiky hair feel without the rigid hold of a gel , the cream might be a better bet
5	this product line was recommended to me via a medi spa when i had an ipl facial as a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin , i was scared to try a product i thought might either make me break out or react negatively i had tried other products in the past from the drug store \( neutrogena \) or beauty counter \( clinique \) , or online \( paula begoun \) all with mixed mediocre results the price was a little steep , but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it i used each product in the trial kit as directed after the three weeks had passed , my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well ! the brightness , tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results ! i decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit , and though it was pricey , it was completely worthwhile after two months of use , my skin is possibly the best it has ever been i have very minimal to no breakouts i do n't have to wear much makeup at all beyond a little foundation or concealer to even out my color lines by my eyes and mouth are reduced redness is gone old acne scars and discolorations are fading the texture is great i have gotten compliments on my skin lately \( you look healthy are glowing ! look so young ! you ca n't be 38 ! \) i almost wish i had taken before and after photos i cant believe it , but i actually threw out all the other non pca skin care products in my cabinet without hesitation anyway , pca skin is an awesome line it does not disappoint it is gentle yet effective no greasiness or icky perfumes you get what you pay for with pca skin
5	perfect nude color goes on smoothly dries pretty quickly protects and lasts well
3	this product is a cheap luxury while most of us are n't able to use it while on the upper of our private , we can afford a higher priced tube of lip balm in our more lives but is it worth it \? not in my opinion i love the smell and taste of it , and it has lots of nice natural ingredients , but it also has some that do n't sound so nice the first ingredient is isododecane , and i could n't figure out what that is other than being a is that good or bad \? because this claims to be a natural lip balm , i wish baxter had explained this ingredient okay , i'm no chemist , so i 'll have to judge this on how it works for me again smell and taste i love it efficiency \? medium it seemed to wear off fairly quickly , but it did leave my lips soft it was easy to squeeze too much product out of the tube , so care needs to be taken not to do that now , the main reason i wo n't get this product again i really , really do n't like the sticky feeling it leaves on my lips for those who do n't mind that , this might be a good product , but for me , it 's a deal breaker i 'll probably use the rest of the tube at night before i go to bed , just to not waste it , but i'm going to stick to my non luxury , next to the cash register bargain lip balms by the way , baxter of california started by creating a gender specific product , one for men , and continued in that direction this product did n't say anything about being just for men i am not a man if i continue to use this , am i going to grow a mustache and have to learn how to spit \?
3	there is no evidence to me that this product is an improvement over many others that are similarly priced or less
3	i like this product , but am a little disappointed overall the smell is nice , and i find it to be more masculine than other reviews have indicated it 's definitely a citrusy scent at the front , but is balanced by some nice herbaceous notes that make it a more masculine scent to me , rather than a sweeter feminine scent the wash leaves me feeling clean and i do n't feel any weird residue on my skin after using this product , and my definitely feels softer than after using a different body wash the consistency of this body wash is a little strange to me , as it is actually a cream that looks like a lotion you would apply out of the shower the cream does n't lather very easily , so i feel like i'm using more of this product per wash than with other products i'm always looking to try new body washes , and i had high hopes from this jack black wash \( their turbo wash is my all time favorite \) but overall this one was a miss for me that i wo n't be purchasing again i guess i am looking for qualities other than a moisturizing agent as the main selling point
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	this spray advertising itself as good for pre and post shave sounds too good to be true right \? turns out , it is n't ! this feels great before you shave i 've noticed a sharp drop in redness along my neck since i started using it before shaving best part is , it works well as an aftershave too i 've used this for quite a few shaves , both before and after , and have barely made a dent on the bottle great value ca n't go wrong such a wonderful smell
4	oribe glaze for beautiful color left my hair feeling soft and silky unlike other reviewers , it did not have a noxious smell , nor did it leave my hair feeling heavy or dirty i used my regular shampoo and a high end conditioner before using this new product i left on my damp head the recommended 3 minutes and rinsed off i have color treated hair , which is gray the real test will be if the color lasts longer in between my regular visits i cannot say that the color popped after drying or that it is the best product i have ever used i do like that it is formulated without parabens and sulfates then again for 58 00 i would have expected no less
4	this is such a gorgeous , elegant makeup bag i love touching it the leather is soft and supple it is well designed and the color is a subtle pink it can almost double as a clutch \( except for the ooh la la in light gold on the outside \) i stored everything from my old makeup bag into this one and added some more just to see how much i can put in it and still have it zip up 2 eyebrow pencils , 2 eyeliners , 3 concealers , small mineral powder , small sunscreen , 2 lip balm sticks , compact mirror , small comb , allergy pills , tissue packet , 2 lip glosses , 2 , blush , 1 blush brush , 1 concealer brush , pocket strips , allergy and i have room for more the bag is n't as bulky when filled as you would think it lies flatter than my other bag because of its shape and fits much better in my purse my one caveat is that because it is such a high quality material and expensive , that i am afraid of what to do about stains i have never had a makeup bag that did not pick up an errant lipstick or blush or pencil stain at some point and i would hate for this beautiful bag to get dirty i think i will have to scotch guard the inside and outside just to make sure it remains beautiful
5	perfume is one of those hard things to review not every scent is for everyone this perfume in particular is a very deep scent some people prefer more light and floral , or fruity scent , but this is much heavier i enjoy it as i enjoy a variety of scents
5	this brand is so smooth and light i like their gentle cleaner i like that this sunscreen does not give a fake tan color on a pale person this brand has a wonderful gentle cleanser you might try this product as well
5	i got this product for my sister who is really acne prone it does not bother her sensitive skin and visibly reduces acne and redness she loves it as a spot treatment as well !
5	this is a really high quality set it should be , for the price each item in this set is really well made the nail clippers are very easy to use the nail file works great the tweezers do a great job the carrying case is a quality item as well and stores everything nicely to keep at home , or makes it easy to pack for the road overall , these are very high quality items
5	this is a spicy , woodsy and modern scent it has a masculine scent it 's got a rich scent i like it i got it for my son who is 30 something who likes to wear more modern scents when he goes out with his new bride for date nights i like the scent it is unusual and original i splashed some on myself , and a little squirt provides a lot of scent use sparingly it lasts for hours if you like calvin klein scents , you will probably like this fragrance it 's spicy and subtle simultaneously it 's complex with undertones and overtones i do n't know another fragrance similar to it it 's distinct i think women will like it on their guy
4	my wife tried this lip gloss \( she 's an avon \) and loved it the color peony which is kind of a pink color is a perfect complement to her complexion she said the lip gloss felt refreshing we did a time test to see how long it lasted it stayed on for about two hours before she had to gloss up again wish it would last just a little longer this is one of her favorites now
4	i generally do n't use toners but was excited to try this one by la roche posay it is a nice toner that does not sting while you are using it and it also does n't dry my skin out many toners are too drying and this one leaves your skin feeling refreshed without drying it out i have occasional breakouts so i am hoping this prevents those the price is right on this toner also
5	great color ! love it !
5	the first skin and co truffle therapy product i tried was the serum , which i absolutely loved this product is also very high quality , with a pleasant smell , that leaves your face feeling quite glowing after using it i 'd recommend using a small amount , as you do n't really need anymore to get the full effect , which also gives you more bang for your buck it 's a little on the pricier side , but if you 're looking for a skin cream and are willing to pay a little more , you wo n't be disappointed this is another high quality product from a high quality brand i really like these truffle products
1	this is not a lip product you can put on so quickly taking time with a tiny lip brush can get it on but you have to take care to do it properly as it stains secondly , it does not last all day although my lips were red for hours , it was not even and it transfers to cups , glasses and even smeared onto my skin on both sides of my mouth i have never seen that not good do n't bother
5	really nice serum , in a nice pink glass packaging i have to say that while l'oreal makes both vichy and la roche , and i prefer la roche to vichy , vichy has consistently higher quality packaging the serum spreads really far \( a little bit goes a long way \) , and it does an excellent job of moisturizing the product description says that it evens and illuminates tone this is because the lotion spreads on kind of pinkish , so it has some color to it no spf in this one , but that makes it smell more neutral !
5	the perfect neutral color ! very fresh looking !
5	this jar is larger than i was expecting , at 13 2 ounces the red jar is plastic , while the lid has a brushed copper look \( it 's not copper , just looks like it \) the jar was sealed with foil underneath the lid the smell is divine ! i really like it reminds me of something aveda might produce , very earthy and natural it says it 's sweet orange and cedar wood , but it does not have a strong citrus smell \( which is good , as that can end up smelling like cleaning products \) but the two scents play so nicely together upon use the product is very gentle , while also a great exfoliant the rich oils leave the skin feeling very moisturized and dewy overall , this product has a very luxurious , high end feel with an amazing scent it would make a great addition to any spa , bath routine , or gift !
5	love this makes skin very soft
5	my other one was just like this , a few years old and started to burn my hair off this new one is still fresh and curls perfectly
5	awesome colore thats really what i need great quality and its not clear colore love it
5	this spray sets your make up and leaves your face feeling refreshed and glowing i highly recommend it but know that this is for a smaller bottle
5	worth the extra money to get the style cream , easier to blow out with this style cream ! cant live without the product bought from blue and their customer service suck !
2	really disappointed streaky , way too sheer , and hardly any color not at all what i expected from the pictures went straight in the garbage
4	great nail polish , one of my favourite classic colors , but delivery to ca took about 3 weeks !
5	most eye creams do n't address the 3 major aging issues wrinkles , dark circles and puffiness this cream has plumped up my skin and made my crow 's feet less noticeable it 's faded the deep dark under my eyes and perhaps most shocking , it 's the puffy bags under my eyes even after eating chinese food , which has enough sodium to make me look like i glued tiny pillows under my eyes , i woke up with almost zero puffiness the smooth metal tip might have something to do with it the cool metal feels very soothing , makes application a breeze and helps the blood vessels to help get rid of puffiness
4	so far so good i 've found the silk'n blue to be a really great alternative to both prescription and otc medications for my skin problems what i especially like with regard to that is that i do n't have to worry about side effects and adverse reactions with medications , as well as allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis all the way to reactions i 've even had reactions and in one case with a pretty common medicine had johnson which no one would ever want ! i feel very comfortable that i'm not going to have any of these reactions with the silk'n blue i have n't had any problems with it so far , and i'm finding my skin slowly clearing my husband suggested i treat one area and leave another so i can visibly compare the difference this was a great idea , so i decided that was how i would go about comparing how well the silk'n blue is working for me \( i will post pictures if they 're not too embarrassing ! \) i like the warmth of the silk'n blue on my skin it 's a very gentle , soothing warmth , i 've never felt any burning the time investment is n't much more than applying medications , and i feel that i'm doing something both safe for my skin , and good for my skin there 's no smell as there often is with medications for the skin as i said , i'm slowly beginning to see positive results with the silk'n blue on my skin i would recommend this to anyone suffering from hormonal acne \( or any other type of acne \)
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
3	this red is not as vibrant as i thought more of a mellow mid red
5	this is great for my sensitive skin it feels nice on my dry skin and my skin feels nice and clean after using it i barely notice any smell which is good for me since i have soaps that have a perfume like smell that i have stopped using once on my skin this is easy to massage into my skin once done it comes off easily my face feels more alive and cleaner after i use this product also , a little of this goes a long way so this should last for a while
5	love the smell similar to baby powder
5	when mario badescu drying lotion comes to purchasing products , i will only buy high quality
5	this is creamy , and the color sand , is a little yellow i use this to cover a blemish , and when i put blush on it all blends in very nice i really like the dermablend products im not really sure this would cover tattoos ! im fair , blue eyes , and blonde weave
3	i'm not sure about this serum it does make my skin feel tighter and makes the fine lines less noticeable \( for a short time \) , but it also dries out my skin i guess the drying is what produces the tightening , but i'm a little leery about putting something on my face that is going to dry it out
3	unlike other reviewers , i did not find this so great i had to use a decent amount on a cotton ball to get my eyeliner completely off and it took a little rubbing therefore , i think the bottle wo n't last as long as i would wish , considering the cost also , i felt as if i needed to wash or rinse my face since i did n't want any residue from the product left on during the night my experience with this brand has always been excellent , so i was surprised
5	la roche posay knows skin for years , when friends were coming back from europe , i would them to tuck some laroche posay products in their suitcase for me i could n't be happier , now that the company has many of their wonderful products available here in the united states this deep cleansing brightening cream is suitable for most skin types it is non drying and non irritating , and offers mild exfoliation there are a lot of products on the market that tend to themselves , this is not one of them squeeze a bit of the opalescent cream onto your hand or better yet , your clarisonic device , and add enough water to bring up a milky foam do n't expect a lot of like most european products , they do n't have an of useless lather that is the result of questionable chemicals the scent is somewhere between a botanical and a floral , but it is so light that many people wo n't notice a sense at all after rinsing , skin is soft and ready for your moisturizer
5	best iron ever
5	love it !
5	this nail polish is the best ! yes , it is kind of expensive , but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful
5	i really like the deep pore brush for occasional cleansing if you use your clarisonic for acne , this is probably not something you want to use every day i make sure my skin is soft out of the shower or bath and then i scrub away the clarisonic has really helped clear my acne and this is good to slough off all the gross old skin
5	so cute
5	go to polish
3	i like the smell and consistency of this cleanser , and it doesnt dry out my face however , it doesnt get my makeup off at all ill probably use it as a morning cleanser only
5	been using pevonia products for 20 years any time a try something else , for say savings or convenience , i regret it and return to the best match for my skin natural ingredients makes a difference
5	love everything in this kit and it does wonders for acne tried the peel a few times , did n't seem to do much , but it might just be really light
5	my skin is very sensitive and this works well without irritating it i am mainly using it on my face and it also does not irritate my eyes it blends in better than some other products i have tried , more like a zinc free lotion does i have walked around with big white patches on my face , so i really appreciate that this factor i do n't know if it works any better than cheaper \( but still expensive \) sensitive skin lotions i have tried , but i like it i think i will stick to my other stuff because of this one 's price
5	update this has become my go to purse compact gives powder touch up without cake its like a very light liquid in powder form , if that makes sense the mirror is a good quality size to check yourself or touch up however , the makeup sponge are fantastic on top of other make up without caking and , this works great on its own when i'm running out the door but do n't want to bother with a full face gives medium coverage with a light blur , absorbs sweat oil this is my fave grab go dermablend original review i 've been experimenting with the dermablend line trying to find that famous dermablend coverage , while letting my skin shine through also , i work outside in a year round warm climate so i need a make up that will survive sweat not run on my clothes i love that they have great products that last are made with a high spf that has n't burned my eyes or bothered my face i really felt creams , for my coverage , were my only option i ordered this bc i needed a contour powder oh my word this powder is amazing first , the most beautiful , large compact with a mirror and a sponge that works ! ! it glided onto my skin like silk finished like suede it 's almost creamy but in a powder i do n't even know a better way to describe bc there is nothing i 've tried like it wow also , the suntan is much lighter than i expected , even after checking out the dermablend website it was a bit tan when i first applied then melted to match my caucasian with a light tan skin finished with dermablend setting spray , \( my new goto staple \) , voila ! magic !
5	really like the subtle but pleasant smell of this and the exfoliating grit is just right not abrasive , not to weak to do anything it says not to use it on the eyes , but i did , keeping them closed , and had no issues with stinging or anything it removed all my makeup and left my skin feeling clean there has been no allergic reaction and no redness or irritation or bumps
3	the color is a bit darker than what i expected and i feel like it is a fake essie bottle , because it is different from what i bought in cvs
5	just put this color on my hands and feet luv it ! ! ! i would recommend this color to all my friends
1	after i used it 3 weeks my skin has no improvement still dry i do n't think this product make a difference
4	my wife tried this and was very pleased with the results of the finished product she let my daughter help , who was fascinated by the process itself , and they had a good time applying we do n't like to sit in the sun or go to tanning places because of the rays and skin cancer \( my grandfather died a horrible death from it so it always scared me \) it did not give her a real dark tan more of a medium tan which she liked very much the only thing she said that was negative was how long it took to apply and go through the process she looks great and she is happy so i am happy would use again !
4	this la roche posay respectissime eyebrow pencil comes on blonde and brown it is not that easy to find eyebrow pencils in a true blonde color this one come close although it still is darker than i would prefer it is fragrance free which is an important quality for me as i have very sensitive skin the pencil lead contains castor and coconut oils , and is parabens free it has a waxy texture that goes on easily , and for me it lasted all day long i found the pencil easy to use , short feathery strokes were best rather than any long , continuous lines it seemed that they looked better on me there is a nice little brush at the end of the pencil that helps make the brows look natural i found it was very helpful in making the brows look smooth the only problem i found with this pencil is the price i think it is rather expensive and would have a hard time buying another
3	i always keep my eye out for smoothing creams i have long curly \( lots of frizz \) , thick hair i tried this product on my dry hair , but it just left it greasy like so i tried it again right after washing while still wet , and i loved it ! made my hair nice and smooth only thing i did n't like was the scent way too perfume strong to me i like more of a natural , clean , tropical scent this did n't do it for me i felt like i out my coworkers i 'll finish off the container , but most likely wo n't re purchase my reason for 2 star
4	a simple 3 step that cool , cleans and not much in the box , 2 treatments , starting with a small bottle of that one applies after wetting down the face it has a nice smell , slightly fruity , that you rinse off after 5 minutes step 2 , open the little peel pack , a moist pad , that one wipes over the face and allows to dry the skin feels clean , dry and slightly tight moreover , if you have any nicks or scratches on your face , you 'll sense a slight sting step 3 is a moisturizing cream with vitamin c that one massages on face and neck again , a pleasant , mildly fruity smell , a nice , relaxing experience , but i do n't know if it makes me look any different , after just 2 treatments my face feels cleaner perhaps , get your significant other to do it for you or do the applications together simultaneously while a
5	i love the color , but again i am a purple girl , and essie did not fail to deliver here either love ! ! !
4	i have been using this facial scrub about 2 1 2 weeks and really like it i 've used a lot of different scrubs and facial cleansing products , but , more than most , this one leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized i think the lines creases that go around my neck have faded a bit , and that 's very encouraging some of the facial products i have used cause a sensitivity to the sun , but i have n't found that to be a problem with crepe erase i like the stimulation of the scrubbing beads as well as the luxurious feel of the gel like substance the beads are suspended in the directions say to use this product daily , and i have tried it in the morning in the shower as well as in the evening at the sink both are fine i have been massaging it into my skin for closer to one minute than two \( the directions say to rub it in gently for 1 2 minutes \) my skin is not overly sensitive , but i'm very fair , so i do have to be careful as much as i like this product , i'm not sure i 'd be willing to pay the price , but only a small amount is used each day , so a tube would probably last a couple of months my results have been very good , but i do n't see a huge difference in the condition of my facial skin if i did , i 'd be more than happy to pay full price
5	this skin oil is fabulous like a lightly scent perfume that wafts through the room and yet it is good for your skin made with botanicals i love it leave it to the french to make something so wonderful
5	this has been the best and most economical curling iron i have every used i have medium thick brown hair , that waves past my bra line in the past i thought it did n't hold curl , but with this iron my curls hold for hours it also curls fast , you do n't need to leave it on the same spot for long i did a ten second per curl emergency fast curl the other day and they held remarkably well in that case , they did n't stay in beautiful ringlets obviously but the waves they fell out into were wonderful and looked beautiful i always finish with a light mist of hairspray , but the curling iron does its job on its own ! \)
4	strivectin has an amazing reputation and i was excited to give their high potency wrinkle filler lotion a try i am nearing 30 , have combination skin , and the beginnings of fine lines under my eyes and around my mouth i used this product am and pm diligently for two months prior to this review pros convenient , small packaging this is easy to toss in your overnight bag and the cap makes it impossible for leaks to happen no odor it 's nice not to be overwhelmed with florals when applying skincare moisturizing and slightly plumping when wearing on my trouble spots \( under eyes and marionette lines \) , there is a slight improvement after applying makeup on top of the filler is this significantly better than a drugstore moisturizer \? hard to say cons a single pump will give you much more than you need \( unless you want to slather your whole face \) this is a downside when the price point is so high there is a weird residue film whether i'm using in the morning and covering with makeup , or wearing at night alone , there is always a layer of this lotion that become slimy when it reacts to water it makes me wonder if it 's really soaking into my skin and treating anything , or just filling in the lines like a pore filler would either way , it seems to sit on top of the skin and never soak in no long term benefit the improvement really seemed to be temporary as in , i could only tell a slight improvement when i was wearing it under makeup
2	i thought i 'd give this bb cream a try since i really like jane iredale products and i always use bb creams i like bb creams because i do n't like to wear heavy foundations and i like the often one step process of bb creams this review is for the jane iredale shape bb 5 in light medium i was so disappointed for several reasons , the first being the color itself it is incredibly yellow i put it on and i looked very sallow and sickly this looks nothing like the way it does on the iredale website \( or on amazon \) and it makes no sense for a medium light look also , for a bb cream it goes on very heavy like a heavy foundation the good thing is that it really covered all of my red marks and any other discoloration really that was great but it also looked like i had a heavy layer of paint on my face and for aging skin this is quite unflattering i am still a huge fan of jane iredale and think her products are of high quality , but i am going to have to give a big thumbs down to this one it 's entirely too yellow , and too thick for a real bb cream which ideally could be used all by itself i love you jane iredale but this one gets a pass
3	could have been more moisturizing i was shocked i like this brand a lot not bad but could have been better
5	perfect for french manicure
5	excellent sunscreen in very humid and hot weather it went on clean and dried up on the skin very quickly no funky smells no sensitivities for the most part , it lasts the intended 80 minutes however , if you 've been sweating re apply often or else you will still get burned before the 80 is on i also re applied to prominent areas exposed to the sun more often than stated and still got a little red , so make sure you realize the 80 minute thing is only under ideal conditions
2	this is the fourth product i 've tried by this brand i have to say , that i 've found the entire line a huge disappointment i think it 's four products too many wo n't be bothering to try any of their other products as i'm fairly confident i wo n't like any of them either this product is slightly better than some of their others but not by much not only is it obvious you have makeup on , it also feels unpleasant it has a greasy almost waterproof feeling to it like their other products this seems to accentuate rather than hide acne scars it covers up minor skin pigmentation issues , but the price is an obvious mask of makeup
5	i love this sunscreen i never get sunburned on my face when i wear this and i spend a lot of time on the water or at the beach i decided to try the tinted in the summer and it works great with my skin tone light complexion with rose undertones
4	this is my first attempt with liquid eyeliner i usually use a smudgy stick , so this will take some getting used to the applicator seems first rate very fine point very clear line i love that the liner cleans off easily , leaving no raccoon eyes this particular , however , needs to watch more youtube videos on how to apply liquid eyeliner when you have very thick eyelashes that naturally curve up !
4	the tin is much bigger than these sample sized products the cleaning solution does a good job removing face makeup but it 's not the best i 've ever used on eye makeup i had to use a second pad to go over my eyes a second time the serum is nice but the bottle is very , very small i 've used some pretty expensive facial serums in my day and this one is good but it 's hard to gauge effectiveness when there 's so little product to evaluate there are only a few applications available the liftactive supreme and the firming lotions are the in this set they both feel great going on , and do a great job moisturizing and tightening up your skin i love vichy products and would have loved this set if i had n't already been using a superior facial cleanser that makes short work of eye makeup and a better serum
5	i like trying new moisturizers , so when offered this product , for an honest review , i could n't pass it by natura bisse , diamond extreme anti aging bio regenerative extreme cream is n't bad it is n't super heavy \( i would say light and super creamy \) , blends well and doesnt make your face look oily after applying your makeup the scent is subtle faint , not overwhelming at all you only need a small amount for example , i use a pea size amount on the four areas \( cheeks , forehead and chin \) on my face and blend it works wonders on dry skin , especially around my nose which is usually irritated around allergy season and on the weekend when i do n't wear makeup , natura bisse gives my skin a healthy glow it also blends in nicely on my neck now to explain why i have deducted half a star well , it is pricey ! the cost for an 1 7oz jar is \( i received a 5oz container \) regardless , wow the retail price is for those who can afford high end moisturizes , this might be worth it , but for the average consumer like me , who doesnt note anything unique about this cream , that is a bit steep what i can say is that i did not have any breakouts or redness following the use of this product , and i have very sensitive skin in conclusion , i like this product , but keep in mind that i have only been using it for a short period of time so i am not sure of the long term effects i will revisit this review if necessary note natura bisse is not paraben free , so if you have a sensitivity to them , this might not be the product for you overall , 4 5 stars
3	i first bought this at a plastic surgeons office , the staff loved it the first jar i used did not go far , you tend to use more than suggested to feel like it covers the upper and lower eyes thought i would try it again but i noticed immediately that the jar i purchased at my doctor 's office was sealed with a sticky tab and the one i purchased online did not have that tab on the jar lid one other thing that concerned me was the temperature it sat in outside until i got home that evening from work the cost savings was nice but it still bothers me that it was n't sealed and i wonder if the low temps that day affected the product
5	loved it , love the colors
5	if you have sensitive skin that dries out easily with cleansers , sun , make up , etc this is the best cleanser to use i can use this twice a day without an issue i use on my eyes with a tissue or cotton ball to remove eye makeup , no problem i love this cleanser ! !
5	thanks
5	great for year round protect facial skin from sun damage ! i mix with skinmedica dermal repair lotion before i apply any makeup
4	eyeshadow , i think looks best on younger eyes however , when i have a special event or evening i apply eyeshadow and , the eyeshadow i use is stila this product is always well made , you can rely upon this brand the in the light eye shadow palette is a collection of stila 's eye shadows in neutral shades that look best on me the palette also includes a smudge stick waterproof eye liner in damsel , a matte chocolate brown , and an 8 page look book with detailed how to tips and tricks the look book is fabulous if you want cat eyes or smoky eyes this booklet is for you it also gives tips on applying the eyeshadow for an everyday look the shades come in a nice packet with 10 different colors bare \( matte ivory \) , kitten , bliss \( matte beige pink \) , sunset \( shimmery canyon pink \) , sandstone \( matte light coco \) , bubbly \( shimmery pale gold \) , gilded gold \( golden brown with shimmer \) , luster \( dark with gold shimmer \) , night sky \( blue with shimmer \) , \( matte black \) i prefer the matte beige pink or bliss i have blue eyes , and this brings out the blue very well these shadows do not run or smudge they go on easily and feel very light they have great staying power , and i do not have to re apply in the evening stila is a product we can rely on recommended prisrob 10 20 14
5	hot tools is my go to brand for curling irons i have 5 in different sizes i use this size iron \( 3 4 \) for my vintage inspired hair styles if set properly , it really the look of a on my hair really wish these bad boys had an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time , but it is still my favorite regardless they last for years , and i 've never had one malfunction on me \( unlike other brands \) a very happy addition to my hair styling arsenal
3	i bought this for my daughter 's prom it went really well with her dark purple dress too dark to wear for everyday occasions for me
3	this is a great under eye concealer for those who are on the lighter end of the skin tone spectrum it helps reduce the appearance of dark circles under the eye , and helps improve the texture of the skin i have been using this twice a day for two weeks my dark circles are purplish in color , and \( thanks , mom ! \) they are not terribly obvious since my glasses hid much of the marks , except with winter pale skin and winter is coming so , when offered the chance to try this product , i decided to get it the cream is a pale , creamy light beige color , and goes on smoothly with the applicator after application , you blend it into the skin with the fingertips if your skin is darker or particularly pale in tone , it may take a little more blending so the cream is not noticeable i have to blend more than my daughter does \( she 's really pale \) it does cover the circles , but , as others have remarked , it does not fade them or make them go away i have noticed an improvement in the texture of the skin under and around my eyes it is smoother and less crepey looking
5	beautifully packaged serum with a pleasant light scent the texture glides nicely and can be used in evenings as part of your daily routine , as well as under makeup like a primer my preference is hydrating my skin without leaving it greasy , and find this serum is an excellent compromise for the summertime , this is just right in weight to absorb in without making the skin look too oily
5	i have thick , sometimes curly and sometimes frizzy hair that can be beautifully tamed with a blow dryer this product is the best i 've found for helping tame my mane
4	it is a little brighter than i expected it to be but that is only a personal preference wish they had the same color but slightly softer
2	, i like other mario badescu products but found this glycolic gel to be too harsh for my skin i will say that a little bit of this stuff goes a long way , so while i ca n't use it on my face , i 've been using it on rough patches like my heels and knees and it works well there and lasts forever ! i 've since switched to a lactic acid serum with better results
5	this is my first time using shellac with using all the other shellac products together helps i 've put them all on so i can see for sure if this is something i want to continue using and doing myself or not so far it 's been one week since i put them on and they are still on o \)
5	great products jane iredale is the best when it comes to cosmetics for women i absolutely love all of her products they are not only good for your skin but they actually work like they are supposed to get smart ladies you can be good to your skin and look fabulous at the same time just use jane iredale ! ! !
4	to my surprise this actually works i do n't wear a ton of makeup but the little bit i do apply has more staying power with this i actually loved the feel of it on my face it 's a very cooling effect in this heat i'm wondering at the lack of scent though hairspray smells good why ca n't this \?
3	i can see where people think this is an eye treatment , and i guess it is , a bit this is way more of a concealer it 's pigmented and has some pearlized material to light \( and get rid of the appearance of dark circles \) although la roche posay as a company has the reputation for a strong science component to their products , they are also a cosmetic company , and that 's pretty much what this product is a cosmetic it does contain caffeine , which has a effect to relieve puffiness it also boasts something called phe resorcinol , which i guess is their own proprietary compound resorcinol itself is an ingredient in argan oil the company states that its own blend is known for its targeted action on melanin , making it sound like this is some kind of skin all products that claim qualities are really talking about lightening puffiness can cast a shadow , which can cause the appearance of dark circles this particular product has a metal applicator i gather the point of that , in using it to spread the concealer around , is that the cold metal will make the puffiness go away you can get the same effect by putting a metal teaspoon in the fridge or in a glass of ice water , then using the back of the spoon to press down the puffiness \( also watch salt intake , which causes water retention and adds to the puffiness \) you might think caffeine would work on dark circles , but that would depend upon the cause of the circles some are , others can be lifestyle related \( \) , or can come from age if your circles have a brownish tinge , use an apricot colored pigment to counter it \( this can be in a concealer or just put on the skin , then use a concealer \) if your circles have a blue cast , try a yellowish concealer this particular product is fine as a concealer , but make no mistake this is much less of a treatment than it is a cosmetic to hide , not cure , dark circles short of surgery and injections , nothing permanently gets rid of dark circles but a good concealer , and knowing how to use it , is n't a bad second choice
5	works great ! ! ! leaves skin soft definitely the best shave gel we 've come across you only need a little bit a little goes a long way helps you get a really close shave not perfumed definitely try this one one can will last a long time
3	great color but something is not right with this polish the color is dull even with a top coat not sure what 's wrong with it
1	this product is not what i consider a serum because it is the consistency of water it basically makes it impossible to apply the product to your face to me a serum is thicker in consistency , not thin and watery i ca n't comment on whether the product performs as promised because i could not use the product without spilling it everywhere it was just too much trouble
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	good size for travel , and a good price ! feels cool on my face , and helps when applying serums and moisturizers
4	finally starting to see some improvement in the dark circles under my eyes after using this product twice a day for almost a month the puffy bags under my eyes are also less noticeable they puffy bags are still there , mind you , but they just do n't stand out as much when i look in the mirror the product itself is very soothing and feels like you are dabbing cool water underneath your eyes it melts into your skin without lots of rubbing or tapping and the cool sensation lasts for awhile after the product has been absorbed the product does n't seem to work as well with the deeper wrinkles at the corner of my eyes so i will probably layer a thicker wrinkle cream there at bedtime for anyone not over 55 , this product could be all you need
5	beautiful sheer gold color applies smoothly opalescent , i love it ! the name is also fitting for the color very pretty
4	fast shipping , product just as described
3	this shaving brush looks very nice it consists of three threaded metal pieces and is quite compact it also came with an insert explaining quite well best practices of shaving with soap and brush unfortunately , the actual qualities of the brush are not that great 1 it smells like a wild animal that has not washed for a while other manufacturers of brushes \( e g \) indicate that the brush is unfortunately , i could not find any indication of this on the product packaging or the brush itself the stench is quite strong i conducted several experiments trying to remove this smell , and none of them eliminated it completely disclaimer trying to do the following with your brush may damage the product first , i washed the brush hair with soap this did not help then i poured water on it this did not help either then i dipped it in alcohol this did help a bit after about a week of brushing the smell is still there , but not as strong i stopped by at a local the art of shaving store that sells high end shaving brushes , where a salesperson confirmed that even high end brushes \( priced at about 250 \) can be smelly 2 the bristles of the badger hair are quite prickly my favorite \( i paid about 100 for it about 8 years ago \) is so smooth and silky , that maybe i got spoiled if this is the case , i suggest splurging enough to buy a silver tip brush the quality of shaving experience will be much higher
5	makes hair smell awesome if you wash every other day !
4	update after using this a couple of more times , i did n't have any irritation , so that first time must have been something else so , for that reason , since i love the way it feels , im adding a star from 3 to 4 this face wash feels amazing vichy purete thermale 3 in 1 face wash is a purifying milk facial wash , eye makeup remover , and toner i do n't really get the toner part , but i can clearly see the milk facial wash part i received a 3 3oz sized tube , which is sort of a travel size compared to the full 6 7 sized product the value of the trial travel size is about 9 50 , while the regular size is just under 20 i love vichy products , and find their items are reasonably priced so i can afford them in my tight budget though this is for sensitive skin , i am getting a little bit of an itch to my skin from it something in it irritates my skin just a little i do have sensitive skin this does happen with products from time to time its not bad , but it is there so i have to put this in my review , and is the reason for 3 stars instead of 4 , since it is supposed to be made for sensitive skin its the only negative to this product ive not had any problems with any other vichy facial product , and as happens with some products , there will be that slight irritation and then it goes away the creamy consistency makes it really easy to smooth onto my face you can wash it away with water or just swipe it chose to wash it away as some reviewers mentioned , it does feel as if it is n't quite washing all away , but i do n't mind this , and in fact , i like the moisturizing feel of it and afterwards , my skin feels so very very love that ! i put some on my hands and instead of washing it away , i just wiped my hands on a towel , and my hands were super residue is felt as i type this , just soft hands what i like about it , as well , is its thicker than the usually micellar waters ive tried more of a creamy consistency instead of a water consistency the vichy product line has been around for about 80 years they have a really nice website with an online magazine with information you can on skin care and their products theres plenty of information there to learn about vichy and its product line vichy and loreal are two of my regular go to companies for skin care ive been pleased with the quality , results , and the reasonable price the only negative to this 3 in 1 is that slight irritation to my slight but still there all the same however , it feels so luxe on my skin , ill likely use it unless i have more irritation from it with continued use
4	i love eye shadows i love how the colors , when applied correctly , makes my brown eyes pop out nicely this quad of colors came out nice i received the rose quad for review and since i am dark haired with light complexion , this quad of colors is perfect for me i applied it yesterday morning for church and i was amazed at how much darker the colors were , even the lighter ones you can really see them and i did n't have to reapply them once after church , i had to take my kids to camp and the color stayed on , even when it was humid out it is not greasy it is not cake like it is actually a nice set of tinted powder that stayed on it did emphasize the fine lines in my eyes , but will add primer to my eyes to take care of the lines \( i will apply it before putting the powder on \) what i really like about this is how the colors made my dark eyes stand out it makes me feel feminine the only thing i did not like was how there were no applicator brush with it fortunately , i had some here but for the price of this eye shadow , i think an applicator should be included as well that is my only complaint other than that , i love it
5	this is great if you like a more natural makeup look it will make your lashes separate and be more defined and of course darker , but it does not give you the heavy , caked on look with just one coat you look like you have any on which is great for those days when makeup is kept to a minimum for other days , just apply another coat
4	although this cleansing soap leaves the skin moisturized and feeling good i found the application to have a pasty feel if you are looking for a cleansing soap that is foamy that is not how this works it 's thick consistency works well with the pores , but as much as i see this as a good product for others it is not my cup of tea
3	the color on the monitor slightly me i thought this would be a coral pink , but the color came off more neon pink i guess that 's the risk of purchasing nail polish online the formula is really easy to apply and does n't have a pungent smell
5	i love elemis products
5	i like this sunscreen and this tizo brand is one of my favorites the only negative would be that it 's a bit on the expensive side and there 's not a lot in this container so be aware of that what makes this sunscreen so great is that it has such a great feel to it it just glides on your face and makes it feel so silky and soft without feeling sticky my skin feels not only protected from the sun , but it feels moisterized as well it 's simply the best i 've used if you 're looking for a little color to go along with your sunscreen , i highly recommend the tizo 3 tinted facial mineral sunscreen that 's my favorite but i use this one too highly recommended , with the reservations expressed above
3	i purchased the babyliss pro titanium plated flat iron a few years ago from a different online retailer it had great reviews , just as on amazon , so i thought it must be really good this flat iron has not been one of my favorites , unfortunately it pulls my hair with almost every pass the plates are nice and smooth though i find that the plates also do n't meet each other evenly from tip to the end this means parts of my hair are getting more heat than other parts it has a temperature setting which is always nice i wish it had been digital it is not a deal breaker for me but i do n't really know how hot a twenty five is maybe that means 250 degrees \? it also has one of the longest cords i have ever seen on a flat iron short cords was one problem i have had with other irons i hate when i accidentally step on the cord and the hot as fire flat iron right across my palm ouch ! i am happy that others have had luck with it but it was back to chi for me
4	i always try out products before i let the pre teenagers any where near them i was glad it was me instead of one of the children when my face turned red what was that about \? so red , but it did n't hurt i would also say that y skin feels smoother after using it however , my skin tone is already great to start with i am very lucky \( the key for me is to never wear makeup other than a little mascara and lipstick \) \( just try telling a 15 year old goth that \) our pre teen was prepared to see his skin turn red he said it was more like a red use a very small amount it goes a long way
3	ok , likely would n't purchase \( there are less expensive options and better products \) this is a thin , watery solution that is difficult to control , you end up using more than you want or need , as it out it may require frequent use to obtain optimal results \? it 's a very average product and i did n't find it impressive
5	i had never used a tinted sunscreen before and i'm not sure what i expected , but it certainly worked well for it 's primary function and i actually did look a little tanner with smoother skin after application as a guy , i'm guessing this might be to wearing some light makeup , which is not something i would have ever thought to do , but it was alright i guess only warning is that if you 're wearing white clothing and it touches your face , it can stain it
5	the baxter of california herbal mint toner is my first time using a toner i have used several baxter of california products that were mostly very good , so i thought to try the toner i used it daily , at night , and it was refreshing , the scent was n't overly strong and it cleans very well it was after a few weeks when i was told by a friend that my skin looked really good i had n't told her i was using anything and told her of the toner my skin is n't bad , it just looked clearer , better after a few weeks of daily use my skin is on the slightly oily side so a nice change was that my skin was clean and the toner did n't dry me out as i use it a bottle like this will likely last me 2 months , maybe more given the cost , this is a good value and i will buy this in the future lastly , i have used several baxter of california products and they have always been high quality
4	this stuff works , but it has a kinda weird hairspray like quality i guess that 's not surprising , since two of the key ingredients are the same as most hair sprays alcohol and i do n't love the smell , and it feels weird when i first spray it on , though it feels natural after it dries i ca n't the stuff too much , because keeping makeup , especially heavy cover up , in place is no easy feat and once the spray is on , it does work pretty well , but i would n't try my luck by rubbing my face on anything one note the shows the woman spraying with her lips exposed i hate getting this stuff on my lips , so i always suck my lips between my teeth while i'm applying you may find that you also ca n't stand the feel taste of the product on your lips and if so , you 'll probably want to do the same
5	love hot tools products , i bought a iron 10 years ago and it 's still working great so i decided to buy another ! got the 1 1 4 in which are perfect for loose wavy curls i'm thinking of buying another one as a backup since the price is so great curling iron glides smoothly through my hair and leaves it nice and shiny
3	the ad for this product notes that the eye shadow is richly pigmented but i cannot say i agree with that i found the colors to be very light , almost translucent in character i do n't think this particular product is worth the price and i would suggest using something from the drug store like maybelline or l'oreal note , i did try another product from this same company , a bronzer , and it worked very well so i guess you just need to try these makeup products individually and not necessarily judge the line as a whole
5	i 've never used products by this company i am very happy with the result i did n't get to chose the color as i received for free i out that it is a shade i have been looking to replace ever since sephora discontinued my fave beige peach as i have deep set eyes , i like to use shimmery shadows like this on the inner corner of my eye and for other along the brow bone i use too faced shadow primer to make eye shadows last longer with the primer it did n't crease on me like another reviewer mentioned and lasted through the night the case is also beautiful purple and green \( my fave colors \) i'm happy all the way around
5	i love this color from shellac , it works for summer and it works for fall , very trendy !
5	calvin klein eternity now body lotion smells great ! goes on smoothly to moisturize and fragrance the skin this lotion has a light pleasant scent that smells gentle bit fruity has a peony 's scent i like it , works for day or night wear 5 5 stars
2	foreo 's iris illuminating eye massager is advertised as an electric version of finger tapping that will promote younger looking , refreshed eyes , presumably by increasing the circulation to the area the device is 5 inches tall , 1 5 8 inches wide , and covered in silicone in the color of your choice each treatment takes one minute , 30 seconds on each eye the gadget has two spa mode \( press once \) , which combines the tapping with vibration , and pure mode \( press twice \) , in which the massager simply to create a sensation similar to tapping according to foreo , the spa mode is for older customers who need a little more help around the eyes you can also adjust the frequency of the tapping with plus and minus buttons , but you will probably not use those first , read the instructions if you can i required a magnifying glass to read the enclosed user manual the manual on foreo 's web site is more second , charge your massager this requires a usb charger it wo n't plug directly into an a c outlet foreo claims that one charge will last up to uses or minutes that 's possible i 've been using mine for 3 weeks \( about 20 uses \) , and it 's still going strong press the center indentation to turn the device on press twice if you prefer pure mode apply some moisturizer or serum to the eye area move the massager along the brow bone above the eye and underneath the eye just above the bone until the massager skips or pauses this indicates that 30 seconds have passed , and you should move to the other eye after one minute , you will feel 3 skips the device turns itself off after 3 minutes wash the iris with soap and water it is better to use moisturizer than serum , as serum will soak in before you get to the second eye you want some lubricant to be present otherwise , the silicone at the skin foreo claims that this tapping and vibrating helps eye creams absorb better , but i do n't know why it would i found the spa mode uncomfortable the pure mode was less so i'm in my forties and showing some puffiness under my eyes i tried the iris to see if it might improve circulation enough to reduce the puffiness after three weeks of using the massager once daily , i do not see any difference in puffiness , and it is uncomfortable to use if it felt good , it would have value , but it does n't the packaging is nice the quality of the massager and battery seem good but it does n't do anything
5	love this color and brand
5	my tan complection filipina wife loves dermablend she has many different tones on her face and body , so she has several different shades she uses rather than trying to make everything the same color it turns out fantastic the way she does it i wish i could put a video up of her before , applying and after i 've never seen any of her make ups come out so well plus it has a helpful spf to keep her from getting darker \( yes she gets darker with sun exposure \) she 's had a zit problem ever since arriving in the usa and has tried many products to stop them the only thing that has worked was going back to philippines for 3 months we have no idea if it 's something in the ingredients of something she eats here , or some sort of spray on the vegetables but she hides it when she wants to look really nice with an application of dermablend products she has 5 different creams , a couple of powders and 2 sticks , varying shades of tan she can apply them very quickly now , but of course had to study them carefully for what worked where and such i'm pleased that dermablend is available for people like her , though it 's a little expensive for the amount you get \( my frugal opinion \) she 's worth it ! afternote i asked her to read over some of the one star reviews from people who were not happy with the results and she could only say maybe they do n't clean their face properly and that they should watch some of the zillion youtube tutorials
5	thanks
4	i used to use another drying lotion but got out of the habit and started using benzoyl peroxide more but lately i 've been having some issues with breakouts due to what i believe to be hormonal changes so i was again looking for a quick solution this is handy for calming and clearing blemishes it is mostly like calamine lotion that has settled down in some alcohol you just take a q tip and dab some on any spot within a day or so you will see changes this is most useful to use at night although if you use too much it will flake off so less is really more the rebecca review
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
2	image skincare clear cell medicated acne masque is more like an exfoliant its gritty texture was surprising the light grayish tan cream smelled like leather balm the directions tell you to leave it on for 5 10 minutes , but the masque burned so badly i removed it after only one minute my skin did feel smooth and there was no lasting irritation however , i would not recommend this product , particularly for those having sensitive skin
5	this is a must ! puts the st tropez self tanner on smoothly , no streaks , no mess
5	i 've been using this product for several months now and i like it very much in my middle age with the crown of my head thinning significantly , i find that toppik is the perfect product to fill in the gaps on my gleaming white scalp it makes my hair look thicker , and is not nearly the hassle of a wig or a hair piece the downside , is that it can be a little itchy and you ca n't really scratch it with your fingers without getting the dye under your nails a pencil works well though also , it should be used with hairspray to keep the fibers in place i do n't much like hairspray and have rarely used it , but all the above is still worth it when i'm out on the town and am feeling self conscious about my thinning hair recommended for anyone with thinning hair , or small balding areas , men or women
5	this is the brush i did n't realize i needed ! it 's so versatile the point allows for precise placement and the sides allow for easy blending the that the handle makes me really feel like a applying her makeup
4	it 's has temperature control with click and on and off control with and the outlet cord the heat from black metal strips that are vertical and pointy brush is made of heat resistant plastic that provides protection against touching directly to skin or scalp within 30 seconds the styling brush was at after turned on the rear plastic guard and how the styling brush is constructed provided ample protection against surface it is going to rest on which i prefer it to be slightly damp towel to rest on the styling brush has last strip of metal exposed and there is no plastic guard at the end which would advantage provide the smooth finish on the hair 's end but it also leaves some heat element directly touching the scalp or face tissue heat at is not strong enough to make a quick burn of skin but , at for thicker curly hair to straighten out it would be something to watch out for definitely not a toy for a child to play with hair needs higher temperature to straighten with thermal hair styling brush , however , i advise slowly building up the temperature to prevent skin burning and never directly use it on a dry hair as it would the hair strands always use a thermal protection spray on the hair prior to using the thermal styling brush thermal brush works in theory that hair will be manageable when wet and hold a form with hair spray and thermal shaping of protein strands as it dries and when surface is flattened with thermal brush it retains this sheen of light as hair forms a flat surface that is part of styling i never knew my studying would come in handy on reviewing a thermal styling brush safety is very well thought out and construction is well made design is good and safe for home and professional use most of the time , thermal wands is best when heat can be controlled easily and this provides easy to tell and control setting to keep the temperature for hair styling if the temperature goes out of control , please replace it and recycle the properly and stay away from completely soaked or wet hair and do n't spray directly into the wand with any styling spray for hold only spritz of spray will hold most hair style this styling brush has to wrap once entirely around the brush in order to prevent heat related burn to skin or scalp for styling do n't use it on a short hair that is not long enough to wrap once around the brush
5	love , love the nail polish looks very nice on my complexion , got a few compliments from only wearing it once
4	i am in my late forties and i have noticed that my eyelashes are much thinner than they used to be i have tried several different high end and drug store brand mascaras to give me fuller and or longer lashes this mascara does a great job of lengthening my eyelashes with one application , they have a naturally longer look to them it does n't really thicken them much , but to be honest , i think they look more natural that way i really do n't like the super thick , bushy eyelashes that look too much like false eyelashes i want a mascara that i can wear daily i have n't had any issues with clumping or eye sensitivity it dries pretty quickly and it can be removed without too much effort
5	my hair needs product there 's no getting around it my locks are a hairy 's nest in the morning , and needs washing , brushing , cursing , , and the right product to look even halfway decent in the morning or else it just needs this this stuff was just perfect for my hair it held it in place while still being and touchable friends commented on how my hair looked it washed out nicely and did n't leave flakes of gunk on my brush and comb this was perfect for everyday use , for the office , for meetings with vendors and , and even the occasional night out good casual product for the stylish gentleman
5	i love nia24 products
5	love it !
5	bioelements is one of the best skin care products on the market i'm 70 years old and my eye lids and orbital area were looking a bit dry i have sensitive skin and also adult acne i have to be careful with skin care products i 've tried many different kinds of skin care products , from very expensive to mid range cost however , i keep going back to bioelements skin care products my eyes are looking and very hydrated i use both night and day just remember the smallest amount and i mean small , goes a long way !
5	i love this cleanser i have sensative , dry skin but this cleanser has not bother me at all i do n't notice that there is much a scent to the product at all , and you only need to use a very small amount , yes , this is higher end in pricing , but when using a pea sized amount , this cleanser is going to last a very long time after cleansing , my skin is left feeling soft and refreshed , not dry and tight like so many cleaners i will definitely purchase this in the future , when i container runs dry !
5	in my 60 's , my skin is normal is not sensitive three products one step this product is a cleansing , milky toner , which cleanses your skin , removes both make up eye make up leaves your skin feeling clean toned it does not leave my skin feeling tight , dry stripped like some cleansers do gentle removes my make up without drying my face leaves my face lightly moisturized apply with fingers to dry face contour eye area using circular motions remove with cotton pad or rinse off with water \( i use a cotton ball \) very nice product
4	the zwilling j a henckels stainless steel soap works as advertised the bar comes with minimal instructions , and the english instructions were covered with tape luckily the tape did not take off the instructions i have used a different stainless steel bar before , so i had and idea on how they work they are not like normal soap when using this bar , here is my suggestions 1 to get the smell off , the bar must come in contact with all skin that has the offending smell on it under the fingernails \? no dice they will smell even with missing the fingernails the smell is hugely diminished 2 you must use the bar for a minimum of 40 seconds a quick wipe will not do it all skin must be scrubbed thoroughly , and the longer you scrub the more effective it will be compared to the soap shaped stainless steel bar i own , this one has curves i was concerned about its functionality until i used it the curves make it easier to touch all the skin and remove the smell compared to my other one this product works well and i would recommend it
3	this moisturizer was a little too thick for my skin type although , i have used other mario badescu moisturizers and loved them this one is just not for me my pores get clogged very easily and i ended having to stop using this product because it was just too rich for my skin if you know your skin does better with thicker moisturizers then this is the product for you
4	this is a very nice everyday cleanser and make up remover for sensitive skin it is a milk cleanser , removes make up and is also a toner the primary ingredient is micellar water , which has been the greatest cleanser since the 3 in 1 facial cleanser lets you lose the toner and the waterproof makeup cleaner i have used a number of the vichy products and i like the line they incorporate a mineralizing thermal water to make their products , so your skin gets extra benefits this 3 3 ounce size is perfect for travel in fact , wish i had gotten it 10 days ago before i went on a cruise and did n't bring eye makeup remover
5	calvin klein eternity now body lotion smells like pure bliss to me such a light sweet smelling scent that really compliments my scent profile not overly strong and the scent stays with me throughout the day has a scent profile of lychee , peonies , peach blossoms and neroli petals all wrapped by a soft cashmere veil , sensual and precious musk for a warm , intimate aura now that might seem like a lot of scents all in one bottle , but they blend beautifully together i tend to have really dry skin on my hands so i am always looking for scented lotions that not only smell good but moisturize and that is what calvin klein eternity now body lotion does for me the price is a little high for me , but for the quality and how nice it smells i am sold
2	the color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats who 's got time for that
5	the smell of this conditioner alone is wonderful ! but the way it leaves my hair looking and feeling is even better my hair truly feels like silk after i use this and it 's great for preserving my red hair color ,
4	always a quality product
4	goes on smooth with a light scent i do have some dark spots on my face and hands and did see some fading of those spots but they are not completely gone i hope the results will continue and the spots will fade completely it does n't leave my skin feeling dry but i also would n't say it leaves my skin feeling moisturized either so i do continue to use a moisturized along with the night cream
5	this vichy 3 in 1 micellar solution is similar to others on the market it does a good job of cleaning the face of makeup and daily grime i like the small bottle for travel and the pop top lid for easy dispensing of the fluid i have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my face or dry it out although you do n't need to rinse it off , i often follow up with a wet wash cloth just because it 's seems weird to leave a cleaner on your face it does have a slight scent to it yet it is not overwhelming i would get this product again
4	i really like this perfume it is feminine without being overly floral my husband said it smelled almost unisex to him if you ever smelled 's before it was discontinued , it is a lighter version of that while it lasts , it has a hint of fruit and \( made up word \) musk scent it is so light that it evaporates to nothing within an hour or two i still love the smell , but i wish it would last longer
5	i use this product almost every time that i use heated tools i am proud to introduce this spray to all my clients that use a flat iron it is light and has a pleasant fragrance my order arrived on time , in perfect condition i will be ordering from this seller again in the future
4	great for spot treatment dries up cystic acne within a couple of days however , the bright pink formula is definitely noticeable and cannot be worn under makeup i could use this only at night , which is why it got 4 stars i have forgotten to rinse it off a couple of times when i 've run out the door in the morning \( without makeup \) , only to realize by the afternoon that no one told me i had noticeable pink spots all over my face all day a little embarrassing
5	make beauty , a company founded in nyc \( i cannot find out exactly what year \) has made a gentle yet effective mascara and eye makeup remover , with its dual phase eye makeup remover what 's more , if you check out the box , you will see that this remover is also offered for use to remove lipstick i tried it both ways and was very satisfied with how it performs in the first place , as a lipstick remover , it was efficient , gentle and thorough my lips felt as if i had had a beauty treatment afterwards they were actually smoother also , there was no lipstick bleeding into those tiny feathery lines which can your lips as you get older it removed my lipstick very nicely and cleanly so , plus points for that ! as far as performance as an eye makeup remover , i used this on mascara which i bought specifically to test this make product my eyes have been quite sensitive for several months and i have been avoiding eye makeup lo and behold , it removed the mascara quick as a wink , with no ill and no mess , either my eye area looks perfectly clean and feels wonderful i checked the prices in the local drugstore and this dual phase eye makeup remover it a bit more pricey , but there are plenty of products up there with it which do not hold a candle to it and yes , it has cucumber and chamomile infused water in it , which make it gentle and easy on your lids i like it a lot and would definitely buy it again ! recommended
5	no need to say it is the best product
3	it works , but because it does n't have much power takes a long time i like the better you can dry your hair \( with a blow dryer or naturally and then quickly and easily style your hair the results are more consistent and pretty professional than with this babyliss product \)
5	i only buy this on amazon great price !
4	a friend and i saw this polish on pinterest but could n't find it anywhere we were so happy to see it on amazon it is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year , as well as any occasion you can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event !
3	i wash my beard regularly i scrub my skin , occasionally moisturize , and brush daily so i was excited by the of a beard oil that promised to make my beard soft , smooth , and manageable i would say by purported claims alone , the product is successful my beard is tamer , softer , and looks better my issue is with the side effects there are two 1 smell the oil has a distinctive odor and it lingers all day i 've experimented with not applying to my moustache area but the smell , wafting up my nose i thought i would get used to it , but it 's kind of annoying and sweet given its proximity to my nose , i was hoping for something a little more subtle my advice is to use a single drop rather than a dime sized amount even then , the smell is powerful and persistent 2 flyaways after a good brushing , my beard usually holds fast after using the i had a lot of stray hairs popping up in my field of vision i thought it might be related to humidity or some other factor , but it 's happened consistently now and i wonder if the oil somehow my beard to take on a life of its own take my comments with a grain of salt i 've got unruly curly hair \( including a curly beard \) , and my sense of smell is perhaps more sensitive than others , or maybe you choose to wear a lot of fragrance that might mask or overpower the oil 's scent while it might work better for others , i'm on the fence about the pros and cons of this product
2	i do n't care for the scent \( smells a bit like repellent \) , but it 's gentle and effective update every time i use this on my old , she a lot neither of us can stand the strong smell , so it 's useless to us regardless of its effectiveness
5	i do not give 5 stars often , but this body wash has earned it i am a big fan of billy jealousy products and use them regularly i have been using the ocean front body wash for some time and it works well i decided to give this a try and i am never switching back this body wash smells terrific , but is n't overpowering this wash pours thick and suds incredibly well i was used to the thin , low sudsing , ocean front and ended up using way too much , the first time around you hardly need any of this product to wash yourself the moisturizing is wonderful ! it leaves your skin feeling lightly moisturized without feeling overly greasy my skin is on the more sensitive side and i have had no reaction to this body wash i fear that billy jealousy will change this product once they figure out how little you need to use i hope they do not because this is my new favorite body wash
3	hydration does not last feels light and fresh , absorbs well but that feeling of plump and dewy skin barely lasts a half an hour i recommend clinique moisture instead
4	this is a good way to try this skin line i have acne and this is a good affordable line to use for acne it is drying so i would recommend following the instructions of starting out slow and building up the usage i think i will purchase it again
4	this color is n't as bright on , but nevertheless , i still like the green essie is slowly becoming my least favorite brand of nail polishes , simply because they seem watered down \( literally \) any essie color i use i almost always have to do three coats but what i can say about essie is that they have such a great array of colors ! they 're always so lush , vibrant , demure but yet sexy at the same time
5	the best ! ive been using this for years i always come back to it if i try something new love !
5	i really like this product , though it 's certainly not a cure all solution since starting to use it a few weeks ago , i 've noticed my skin is less oily and feels smoother , with less breakouts though it 's less oily , the face wash is definitely not drying however , i'm still breaking out from time to time just a little bit less than usual i love the way my face feels after washing it with juice but beware if you accidentally get any in your mouth the taste is less than awesome \( not that any face wash tastes good this one just tastes really chemically \) i 'll keep using this as it 's one of the best face washes i 've found update to 5 stars i 've been using this for a few months once a day and just finished my first bottle my skin has never looked better and i 've had far fewer breakouts than ever before i ca n't believe i'm spending this amount of money on a face wash \( i'm normally a 6 99 neutrogena girl \) , but this is so worth it to me
5	is a lovely bronze with little flecks \( minuscule flecks \) of glitter , subtle but very pretty the way it in the light i would say it is flattering to most skin tones and it goes on well wears well unlike the butter london metallic polish i tried that did n't have any glitter it was beyond awful streaked , looked horrid on and chipped quickly i also have all hail the queen a metallic with the shimmer and it goes on brilliantly and wears well my lesson in butter metallics is to only go for those with shimmer
5	i have been using this for a year and i still love it i originally bought it on a cruise and my eyes do n't have dark circles any more and look so healthy that people made comments after i lost 40 pounds and a lot of it showed in my face i use it in the laugh lines around my mouth too i look healthy they say that 's so cool i believe in this product and will continue to use it
4	i have this in shellac , and vinylux is not as pink as the shellac i love these polishes , though i like the shellac colors better than the vinylux here are some true color comparisons romantique , lavishly loved , , negligee and negligee is the most pink
5	gentle and effective product
4	this smells so fresh much better than the other burberry women 's perfumes this smells light with a hint of floral , and lasts a long time
5	i like vichy products and always bring some back when i visit france this sunscreen is lightly scented and not greasy or heavy does n't make my skin breakout even under makeup it also does an excellent job blocking uva uvb
4	i have three daughters , all with very different hair textures and i have used this on all three without a doubt , this worked best on the daughter with thick , textured hair the little grooves along the wand held onto her hair curled it perfectly this creates anything from loose waves to tight ringlets depending on how you wrap the hair i will say that this does not work for my very fine hair at all you can see the little bumps from the wand onto my finished hair it almost appears crimped so my final take on this is if you have thick textured hair , this is a winner , but if your hair is fine thin i would pass on this one
4	this adheres to your skin pretty quickly so if you want to smudge it you have to do it quickly it stayed on about 10 hours it did not seem to irritate my eyes although i only used it on the corner of my eyes and not all the way across it is a nice dark brown , not black , not milk chocolate brown
5	i am almost out of my tube now and am planning to purchase i love this sunscreen because it gives my skin a little life , a little tint , so it gives me that no makeup look it does slightly even out the skintone , but does n't have a lot of coverage when i first tried it i thought it looked way too dark orange , but it is so sheer that it just gives a nice tint do n't be afraid of it it 's kind of like a bronzing base , but i struggle to even label it that because it sounds too severe it feels very smooth and silicone y , as most mattifying products do i feel it keeps my skin matte enough , but being matte all day is n't really a concern of mine i 've never become greasy looking while wearing this so i suppose it does work it just looks like skin all while having amazing spf 50 and the tube has lasted me forever if you 're looking for a tinted sunscreen that gives your skin a sunkissed pick me up , look no further i love it and would recommend it to a friend looking for a tinted sunscreen unless they were extremely fair , i would recommend it to them i have a light medium skin tone with warm undertones
5	i love this lip balm ! it smells awesome and does the job
4	works very well at diminishing fine lines and moderate deep wrinkles also does a good job of hydrating crepe eyelids as far as dark circles and bags go , this cream comes up short so , based on your eye issues , this cream will either be the greatest or a complete waste of money
4	you gotta hand it to people who write the descriptions of perfumes apparently , my nose is nowhere near as sensitive as theirs , and i'm not sure i caught the fresh and playful top notes with italian lime , icy pear and crisp green almond , nor the sensual notes of vanilla bean i did however notice the sweetness of the scent , although i could n't say if it has anything to do with sugared almond or not my wife and daughters use this , and when it first goes on it has a very clean smell , but after a moment i can definitely sense a sweet scent to it and i realized for the first time last night that as the evening wore on \( we were at a friend 's party \) i could still smell it on my wife and there was definitely a floral feeling to it so , i guess they really do know what they 're talking about when they describe it as they do regardless , i think it 's a very nice fragrance and it lasted very well outdoors on an evening where temperatures stayed in the mid 80s a very pretty bottle , too
2	it is a very strong floral scent , too strong not spicy scent at all it 's like old 60 's perfume scent my grandma had on it gave me a headache the moment i sprayed it lingers for a very long time it is definitely a whole day perfume strength
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	you 'll experiment , of course , but in our experience \( two users , different ages \) , it does n't take very much the hold is good and not stiff or chalky it lasts washing it out is not a problem there 's not much scent and what there is is n't unpleasant all in all , we were pleased
5	i 've always had weak brittle nails that are prone to peeling and tearing , especially when i'm trying to grow them out i 've also really been into nail polish lately including gel polish that requires and led light , so with all the acetone remover my nails have been especially delicate i 've been rotating painting my nails with regular polish and painting my nails with this nail treatment and it really does seem to work i 've been prepping my nails with a cuticle remover and then painting on two coats i like that it dries quickly , has a nice sheen , and that my nails do feel harder and more resistant to damage when i have it on i 've been wearing it plain with no polish on top but i 've also heard from women in a nail polish group i to that it works really well as a base coat as well i also like that i see the benefits even after i take it off the only thing worth noting is that julep 's regular sized polishes and treatments are smaller than most standard polishes so you are not getting a ton of product for your money , but it is very effective
5	finally found it for a lower price than 's or their website the teeth on my old one were coming out , so i 'll pack that one for travel , use this for every day
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	this is by far one of the best setting powders i 've tried so far i love the giant container and how much of it you get since it 's not very cheap i use all the time and it did n't break me out and it lasts a long time i have been applying it with a fluffy powder brush and it works great it makes my face look flawless and does n't make me look cakey or powdery
4	first day i used the julep blank canvas primer under my usual foundation \( nars \) i got a very lovely compliment that my makeup looked amazing i find this primer very easy to apply and smooth out , without irritating my face other primers i 've used seem to make my face ruddy at first , and one of the prior primers i tried had an odd scent not the case with julep blank canvas primer i really appreciate that i can use less foundation over the primer than if i use foundation alone it gives a bit more glide to the liquid foundation i typically use makeup still looked refreshed after many hours of wear photographs well i highly recommend using a good cleanser w facial brush \( such as clarisonic \) or an exfoliating mitt \( i use jane iredale 's \) when taking off makeup primers do tend to cause breakouts when not well removed i found that julep did n't cause any considerable breakouts and i 'll continue to use this primer as the first step before applying liquid foundation
5	i was skeptical about how great a comb could actually be , especially to justify the high price tag , but now i understand this baxter comb is so well made and does n't have sharp teeth which so many cheap combs have , which can hurt or scratch your scalp i am a new loyal baxter customer ! my only concern is how well the teeth will hold up over time , and in case it 's dropped on the tile floor , if the teeth will break off i will come back and add to my review once i have more info to share regarding this point in the meantime , i give this comb a big thumbs up !
5	this is my new signature fall polish ! ! love this color ! it looks black , but in the light there is some shiny wine undertones
5	this self tanning mouse works really well ! so well in fact , you must be sure not to get it on your palms because it is difficult to remove one use and i was a lovely shade of light brown the foam can be used quite sparingly and the bottle is large so it lasts a while i would recommend it to anyone looking for a real sun or tanning bed alternative once i saw an age spot on my face i was done with the sun !
5	i am not sure i am going to do these brushes justice with my review i always had my doubts about the clarisonic brush and its cleaning capabilities however , i got these brushes and decided to take the plunge and purchased a mia fit from my local sephora with a 20 off coupon there are four brushes which i will outline below with what they are , what they do and how i feel about them cashmere cleanse luxe brush cleanse while increasing hydration in the skin i am honestly surprised that this brush did make my skin feel more moisturized and less dry and flaky radiance brush refresh dull skin to reveal softer , smoother , more radiant looking skin this was a soft but a bit more firm then then sensitive brush head my skin felt clean and soft after using this brush deep pore brush helps minimize the appearance of pores i use this one on sunday 's when i do a hair mask and other longer beauty things the bristles are soft but much more firm then other brushes this one is a bit more rough on my skin and that is why others may be able to use it more often sensitive brush cleanse gently yet effectively , for all skin types this brush works great for everyday use sometimes twice a day due to workouts , swimming and other outdoor dirty activities when i feel like i need to clean my face this is a great set and once my brushes start to wear out , i will buy this set again to replace them
4	nice light cream that lasts my skin seems less dry and wrinkles lessening i always heavily moisturize right out of the shower and the only thing i 've disliked is that this small bottle is hard to find in my makeup basket by the sink it hides on the bottom and blends in no scent is appreciated
5	this is the only nail polish that has been able to help my nails grow my nails used to be very thin and break or peel constantly , but they are now long and extremely strong i never skip using this as a basecoat
4	this moisturizer is quite pleasant and fragrant it is a little thick going on , but absorbs nicely it leaves your skin feeling fresh and is not heavy , nor seem to clog your pores i will continue to use it however , i must point out that i reviewed another similar product on vine i got immediate and ongoing results , and i have continued to purchase this other product i know it is not reasonable to expect immediate results , but it did happen i will definitely continue to use the other product since it is less expensive and works better for me perhaps if i had not been introduced to the first product , i could be more enthusiastic now therefore , i rate it a four
5	oh my goodness ! ! ! my makeup brushes were a mess i thought they were half way clean until i used the japonesque waterless brush cleanser on them and saw all the makeup residue come off onto the paper towel you wo n't believe how easy it is to clean your brushes and keep them that way this product came from amazon and you must get your brushes cleaned by getting some today just spritz your brushes while rotating to get all surfaces while laying on paper towel and then rub slight on towel to see the gunk clean out you will want to go to amazon and order yours right away
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	the service and product were great !
3	this product is rather thick , and the glow produces too much shine for my face it makes me look older and oily one a positive note it did not cause any breakouts or irritation it has a pleasing scent , and there is good amount of product , but i just do n't like the high shine on my face i know the golden shine is right now but i hope that trend ends soon
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	i have to admit , this is my first experience with a high quality nail clipper and what a huge difference , compared to the drugstore version i have been using all my life the blades are very sharp , giving you a nice , precise cut the product is stainless steel , so it should last a long time \( and i am talking years , here \) the clippers themselves are very light in weight , and slim in design the leather case is perfect for putting the tool away , and the fit is tight , which is good , as leather over time i do n't foresee the clippers falling out of the case in the future the absolute best thing is that the nail clippings stay inside the clipper and you just tap the clipper lightly on a paper towel \( or right into a waste basket \) and your clippings are properly ! so easy ! and no looking for nail clippings that have all over the room , either \( that is awesome \) there is a little trick for first , like myself it took me a try or two to get the clippers in the right position to work properly , even with the instructions on the package the important thing is step 3 you need to push the handle forward when it is fully raised , before you lower it again to begin clipping \( otherwise , they will not clip properly \) now that i have that mastered , i do not anticipate any issues with nail clipping these are a gem i am a true convert , and i will never go back to using poor quality , drugstore version nail clippers , again
1	this product has a pretty strong fragrance , and as far as i know , it does not have sunscreen ingredients after a couple of painful experiences , i have decided to skin test every skin product i am ever interested in wearing i'm glad i tested this using a tiny dot on the belly of my arm near my wrist instead of putting it on my face within 24 hours , hives started on the spot i tested the consistency is pretty thick , and the color is appropriate for my fair , east asian skin i was hoping it would not cause me issues , but unfortunately , i cannot recommend this to anyone who has very sensitive skin like me however , i have to be fair the only reason i decided to try it was because it had a score of 3 from ewg , which means it 's not very toxic although this is a new product , so it does n't really have much data yet on ewg either try at your own risk if you are sensitive i thought that my skin allergy was related to chemical sunscreen ingredients , but i am beginning to think it 's something else , or in addition t the sunscreen i'm guessing i may also be sensitive to fragrance , which is the only thing in this product that got a dangerous score of 8 on ewg in case anyone wonders about what else i am allergic to so that it may help you decide on whether to try this , i am very allergic to the mary kay time wise sunscreen as well as the hawaiian tropic silk hydration spf 30 http www amazon com hawaiian tropic hydration sunscreen lotion dp ref cm product however , i am not allergic to nivea q10 and cetaphil lotions http www amazon com gp product sorry i ca n't really give you more information on wear and coverage i wore it on my wrist to test it first and now my skin is bumpy and itchy and red however , even though i wore a long sleeve shirt today , it did not rub off very much at all \)
5	wow i love this product and it is perfect if you have severe dry skin as i do i lack moisture in my body because of an and my skin is often dehydrated and it looks and feels it i also have chemical sensitivities and very sensitive skin i absolutely love , love , love that this truly has no fragrance i cannot by scented products on my body it 's like they just penetrate my nose when they even have a touch of scent i could smell absolutely nothing on this balm my skin felt so good after i put this on it 's heavy although very smooth i can still feel it on my skin the day after i put it on and my skin feels plump and moist this is a product i will continue to use and if you have extremely sensitive and extremely dry skin this is a product you should try
3	i have a sensitive combination skin type so my assessment is based on how the mask worked for the two separate qualities of my skin 1 \) as far as sensitivity , the mask did n't have any adverse effect on my skin i guess there was advantage to the masks organic content there were no chemicals in this product that usually irritate my skin 2 \) the mask really dries your skin some areas of my face are oily , and after using the mask , they felt fine however , the majority of my skin is of dry to normal quality , and my face mostly felt dried up by the mask i did n't experience any hydration or reduction of blemishes this organic mask was n't a perfect match for my skin type , but i might save it for warm season when my face is at its oiliest
5	lovely color and scent lasts for hours
5	pomade is a hair styling product that gives a stronger , longer lasting hold than other traditional gels and sprays baxters of california is a well known , trusted company known for quality pomade because pomade can comes in different varieties and is kind of pricey , baxters has offered a sampler set with their clay \( firm hold matte finish \) , cream \( light hold natural finish \) , hard water \( firm hold shine finish \) , and hard cream \( firm hold natural finish \) varieties this gives users of baxters pomade the chance to try a new type or mix and match various varieties for an ideal look without buying an entire container its also great to let new users choose which one to purchase also , the sizes are convenient for travel if you need to maximize space on a trip if you want to know more about using pomade in general you can visit visit baxters how to videos here the only downside is that you pay more per ounce for this set than buying the regular sized containers \( 28 00 for about two ounces vs 20 00 for two ounces \) i gave it 5 stars because its a cool gift idea , perfect to try out their different varieties , and good for travel and , the pomade is high quality and works also , if you know you want to use pomade often , spending a little more for this set will allow you to try out the varieties and pick the one you like this will save you from wasting money in the long run but , if price is your concern , you might want to read up on the different varieties \( basic description above in this review \) and then pick one based on your research
3	the picture shows it kind of pinkish , at least on my screen i knew it would n't be the exact color pictured all products differ at least slightly from the picture but it 's really a pale brown color instead of anything even along the pink spectrum i 'll still wear it , but i was really hoping for a neutral pink color , and instead i got a brown that wo n't match much of what i wear i'm rather upset that it is n't what i expected , and i really do n't much like the color
5	love love love this ! ! !
5	love this ! love all his products watch youtube if you want to hear in depth reviews
5	this is really nice and refreshing my wife used it nightly when the air is dry here in the west coast she liked the convenience of just spraying it on your face and she uses her night cream afterwards my nine year old daughter uses it too , we love that it is safe to use for the whole family we did n't see a significant difference in our skins but more on how it feels you would feel fresher , and cleaner , and skin feels after use
4	japonesque velvet touch blush shade 3 is peachy pink with a little bit of shimmer the color builds as you apply more layers too much pigment can make the older generation look like clown make up was used with japonesque blush , one or two is enough does n't look clownish younger women can apply it heavier still look great it stayed on all day for me \( about 6 hours \) the mirrored compact measures 2 1 4 square the compact is a little bit hard for me to open which can be a good thing , because the blush wo n't get over everything in my purse or make up bag but , i always end up getting my finger or thumb in the blush when i open the compact i'm practicing other to prevent this problem mirrored compact bring your own brush \( make up brush not included \)
1	does not work as well on break outs as thought
4	i got this for my husband about a minute before he decided to grow his beard out as a result i have been using it on my legs and it works well no post shaving irritation or bumps i find the perfume a bit much , not that it is too masculine \( that would be ok \) , just that it is pretty strong i use more on my legs than you would on a face so it does n't last long overall , a very pleasant experience
5	gorgeous color , goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone very happy
5	love bioelements
4	my hair is thick and in pretty good shape , but has a tendency to be a little dry i use this once a week and then use my regular shampoo and conditioner the other days it takes getting used to and i used too much the first couple of times trying to get a lather which of course , i did n't get the fragrance does not bother my allergies at all i like it and i like the way my hair smells and feels after using it i rarely blow my hair dry and if i do n't use electric rollers or a curling iron to smooth out the dry ends , my ponytail looks like a when i use the oribe i do not have that problem so that 's a major plus for me
3	scents are like wine , what one person likes , the next may not this is how i feel about obsession for men it is not my favorite scent for a man , though i realize that body chemistry has a lot to do with the end result it 's a rather musky cologne , which i usually enjoy , but a bit heavy for my tastes it does not say , i need more of that to me , which i believe would be the reason for wearing it for most people it is in it 's name , right \? my one ounce bottle came sealed in cellophane and appears to be authentic i have not purchased it before so ca n't compare to that experience if you like obsession for men , i would recommend amazon as a source , with them as the third party sellers may not be as reliable
5	this cream feels great , smooth like satin or fine silk it 's a little tan for me , but the tinted cream blends well on my sun tanned arms spf 50 sounds good i 've not heard of applying coq10 to t he skin , and i'm not aware that this component will work as an antioxidant when used , but i assume the manufacturer has researched this method the price is a little more than most women i know would pay for such a product
5	the perfect neutral color ! very fresh looking !
5	my holy grail morning serum provides instant hydration to layer under daytime moisturizer pleasant scent , reasonable price never want to be without it i 'd recommend something more intense for night serum something packed with vitamins , beneficial plant oils , etc but especially if you 're new to the world of skin serum , you ca n't go wrong with this it 's wonderful for dehydrated skin \( different beast than dry skin ! \) and gives a plumping , hydrated feel to your face due to the hyaluronic acid this serum is beloved by beauty across the pond \( like and \) , and for good reason !
5	i like it and think it is best applied with a brush as it is more like a powdery substance therefore i do not understand the ones complaining that it does not come with an applicator \? most women would already have a nice makeup brush anyway i am fair toned with natural blonde hair and blue eyes i think the product applied with a brush in moderation works just fine even with my light tone marilyn
4	mario badescu products are really good and this shampoo gives a good lather and leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny i like it
5	so pretty natural
5	this is a life saver i could not live without it i have a full head of hair , but there 's one spot on the top of my head that is thinning out and i'm very self concious , so instead of going through a transplant , this does the job a friend of mine that had the same problem but she has her hair with highlights , uses it as well , and she has 2 bottles , one in light medium brown and another blonde , and she uses both at the same time it looks great
5	smells amazing ! my favorite facial spray
5	nice coverage and no rash the ingredients seem good for a make up product very smooth and refined , not chunky the color works really well , but all colors are subjective kind of hard to tell how it will work in a computer screen overall very satisfied
4	this is a soft foam applicator that my wife used with her smashbox foundation \( no concealer actually comes with the tool , so it could not be tested with any of the scott vincent borba products \) first , negatives out of the way 1 way too expensive at 40 , as of now the price needs to be lowered for this product 2 there are no cleaning instructions with the tool , so one is left to their own as to what cleaning product to use she finds warm water and facial cleansing soap work just fine on the positive side , this tool helps blend really well and the smoothness of the stem makes it easy on the hands ergonomically friendly the angle is perfect for reaching otherwise difficult areas , which she would normally do with my finger she is giving it 4 stars solely on the basis that this item is overpriced had it been about 20 , i would have given it 5 because it is so new , she does not know how long the foam part will hold up however , it appears to be well made
5	love the natural look
5	great product i like it great product i like it great product i like it great product i like it but i do not like having to write extra words on this post !
4	ive had various 100 boar brushes and my hair would get very i could never brush my hair all the way through along with other troubles this brush works for me i still have mixed feelings about the price that is a ton of money for a brush i do n't understand the branding factor or know anyone with this brush either but i bought it out of desperation because i have tons of brushes , each with their own i was just searching for something that i could just have one or 2 brushes that fit my needs and my beauty routine pros nylon and boar reach your scalp most of the time quality is clearly high it 's very sturdy and the pad part is soft its nice to have less brushes because this one does a better job than the ones i had gets rid of a lot on your scalp \( this is a pro and con \) it massages your head , it does n't hurt at all \( i'm pretty sensitive headed \) and it makes brushing your hair a nicer experience love the large size of the pad ! i almost got a smaller one because it 's cheaper but i'm glad i did n't ! very easy to clean and comes with a cleaner brush too cons nylon and boar do n't always reach your scalp if you have thick hair for me it 's a spot on the back of my head that i have to work a bit harder for but i do get there if you use or thick treatments for your hair , do n't use this brush with those it kind of just rubs over the top i did this with a mud i did manage to get my hair amazingly enough but it took a long time if it is tangled , you will need harder teeth for that to speed the process not to mention the treatments you use could damage the of the brush using oils in your hair will degrade the brush over time \( with the price you 'd hope that would n't be an issue \) i do n't know how quickly though this brush will pull out stuff in your hair you did n't even know was in your hair , it 's kind of gross but it 's also a good thing not meant for high heat styling ! i hope this helps for those still debating for me , this was absolutely worth it and i do n't regret it as i thought i would i would definitely buy more if i ever needed to \( and had the money at the time ! \)
5	this oil is exactly what my aging hair needs only use a tiny amount worth every dime
5	this is the best hand cream i have used already this has healed the tiny cracks from the cold on my hands , this is not greasy and absorbs very fast my husband uses this also on his dry hands and his hands are also healed i use this two to three times a day and by far this is the best ever , i would recommend this to anyone
3	this is not worth the extra money it has a nice lather while brushing , but the ginger is totally undetectable , and the paste itself is not special enough to justify spending around ten dollars tom 's cinnamon and clove has my vote for a fun taste and good functionality sure , the packaging is pretty but it 's also not worth an extra 5 7 dollars per tube
5	i 've never been great about taking care of my skin , but now that i'm aging \( late 50s \) , i am trying to be better one area is my neck i was a little afraid of trying this product because i 've had some allergic reactions in the last year or so after trying some cosmetic products fortunately , this one did not cause any allergic reactions it feels pleasant when it 's applied , and there 's enough product to last a long time \( which is good because this stuff is very expensive \) according to the package , the ingredients include pro niacin , , algae extract , and sodium hyaluronate all of which contribute to slowing down the skin aging process and maybe even reverse some damage the product definitely made my skin feel softer and tighter also , the next morning i thought the product made my neck look better maybe it 's an illusion , but i definitely plan to continue to use this
5	pleased
1	product did absolutely nothing for my hair it seemed like this product was just scented air , and that 's it ! did not provide texture , volume , or anything at all i have very thick heavy but fine hair , very long \( to my waist \) i think this is such a lightweight product that it 'd work best on those w very lightweight baby fine hair that is easy to if your hair is difficult to get volume in it , then i do n't think this product would do a thing for it
4	i really like the scent on this of the notes used , i can definitely smell the citrus but it 's toned down with the base notes of sandalwood and musk and then there is that wonderful hit of floral from the cherry blossom and rose an very nice well round scent , only one spray is necessary anything more would be overpowering i would definitely wear this for special occasions as i do n't wear perfume much but did enjoy the wonderful mix of floral , citrus and wood musk
2	i wish this product had worked out better i have very fine hair , so it can be challenging to find a product that does n't weigh it down , but still adds hold and texture even with my short , fine hair , man made clay offered no hold and gave minimal , if any texture it is also hard to put on , prone to clumping unless you rub wet hands together once you get some product out i'm bummed , because it smells awesome , but it just does n't do what it is supposed to do
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	as i have stated with another review for shellac i think this is worth pointing out to potential buyers that this is a uv polish it requires curing via a uv light and is used with shellac uv base and top coats ! having purchased a bunch of pinks and reds , i decided on something a bit different and this certainly fit the bill ! its a beautiful color , really unique and perfect as we go into fall ! the color may best be described as a deep purple ! it is a deep color i cured the base coat for about 2 minutes , as i find this works better than the time suggested on the bottle which is in seconds , then applied 2 coats curing each for 2 minutes ! it needs the 2 coats as the color is a little faint and washed out with just one application ! then followed with a generous coat of the shellac top coat ! the result pretty and shiny nails , i have been wearing this color for 10 days and still no peeling or chipping ! it looks as shiny as the first day i applied it and the color is still vibrant ! it is really a cool modern color and will look great for fall winter and a great party idea for halloween ! it is pretty dark so worth noting ! to remove i find the easiest thing is to get a small bowl , fill with some acetone and soak for about 6 10 minutes , it simply melts off with no problem !
1	it 's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque i'm super disappointed ! ! ! ! i was so excited only to be extremely let down awful formula , do not buy even over white it just looked ugly and messy
5	amazing find ! !
5	i love pureology ! this spray has done wonders for my fine hair , it 's soft , no more breaks , i love it !
1	i bought this brand of polish because of the healthier ingredients i also bought the base and top coats by butter london \( 29 99 for both \) and followed exact instructions i used a base coat , 2 coats of polish and top coat less than 24 hours later , it 's chipped dramatically all over unfortunately , i ca n't return these products because of amazon 's return policy of hazardous materials i e nail polish
5	i got this as a sample with a store purchase and i decided to try it so i started using it on the corner of each eyes and on my lid and the bottom because i started having fine lines but i see that using this those line and made them a non factor so i had to get another sample to keep the magic going
1	i bought 2 of these and i'm very disappointed these cost the full price of an essie polish so i expected it to be authentic these are watered down fakes i wish amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff \(
5	i chose this as an experiment the picture of this color on a model reminded me of the light to white shades of the 60s which is not a look i'm going for fortunately this is nearly a neutral gloss for me which is exactly right i am very pale year around so i do n't want even lighter lips this color \( charming \) imparts a bit of pink but mostly gloss i have very reactive lips and have had no rashes or irritation from this i 'd definitely buy this again and would go for a darker shade for impact however , i really love this one as a day to day gloss great product
3	well , i have used this for a few weeks now i can say that no irritation occurs on my face at all a dab is plenty , for smoothing over my face , and it does leave my skin feeling soft as far as rejuvenation goes , either it 's just too late for me , or the results are very minimal i see no difference i have had dry skin all of my life , and it is winter , with all of the extra dryness adding to skin problems , and thus to more noticeable wrinkles maybe i'm just 20 years too late \?
5	this is a great jet black mascara that does n't have that makeup y smell some mascaras have it went on easily and did thicken and lengthen the look of my lashes as advertised the bristles are really short and separated so the mascara does not clump the is smooth and fashionable and not too big or heavy to stash in your purse this is my new favorite mascara , i have nothing bad to say about it
5	very nice
1	buy an alternative !
5	i'm not usually a fan of expensive bath items but this is one product that won me over we do n't typically use sulfate free shampoos or conditioners in our household , so i thought this was worth a try it does n't bubble and lather like traditional sulfate shampoo , so that took a little getting accustomed to the results were nothing short of fabulous after washing a few times with this in place of our regular foaming shampoo , hair was clean , soft , fresh smelling and best of all , highly manageable i was able to easily style my hair into a nice neat conservative style without using hair cream my hair would be frizz city if i tried that with a run of the mill shampoo we also like that this product is cruelty free and there are no harsh chemicals the fragrance is pretty pleasant as well it 's an herbal minty combo that smells very fresh and clean without being overbearing this works very well with our naturally styled hair and completely eliminates dry hair frizzies like most shampoos cleansers , the directions instruct to apply , rinse , repeat you 're supposed to leave it in for a minute or two during each application i actually found it works very well when i apply it at the beginning of my shower , work it into my hair down to the scalp really well and just leave it in until i'm done showering i rinse it out right before the shower that has done wonders with my hair and helps the product last longer as well
5	butter london has once again met and exceeded all my expectations this polish color is just as vibrant as it appears butter london 's colors are always rich and beautiful in person all what i really love about their nail polish is the fact that is does n't have any of the horrible smells that many of the other brands have because they cut out those chemicals the polish does n't destroy the nail like many other products and is always easy to remove and applies smoothly and thickly two coats is perfect if you have n't tried their polish before i highly recommend it !
5	this stuff is my ish ! i have super fine hair \( but lots of it \) this is the only texturizing product that actually works for my hair and makes a difference
4	this color is n't as bright on , but nevertheless , i still like the green essie is slowly becoming my least favorite brand of nail polishes , simply because they seem watered down \( literally \) any essie color i use i almost always have to do three coats but what i can say about essie is that they have such a great array of colors ! they 're always so lush , vibrant , demure but yet sexy at the same time
5	i have combination skin , plus i have a stressful job and life i also have very sensitive skin so finding something that works that did n't dry my skin out or give me a rash or burn my skin has been something of a wild chance i was actually gifted a small version of this in their detox kit and fell in love not only did it work , but it did n't smell , was easy to use , and i could literally see the difference in a matter of days not weeks i know that more than likely wo n't be typical for most people , but i know i 'll continue to buy this as long as it works
1	i use a self tanned this sponge is too hard to lightly remove the lotion i tried it several times in different areas i still wound up with the same results you can use a a tissue to remove excessive over added sun tan in the bottle for me this did not work
4	the brush applicator is especially useful to stipple on small spot coverage and i found that to be the best use of this product for me it did hold up without any touch ups all day but the slim pen applicator had a secure cap would be easy to stash in a purse if needed as a spot concealer i would give it 5 stars i did not like it as much as an under eye concealer because it is n't really that opaque when blended out over larger areas in addition to not covering as well as i like and it also had a pale cast to it that called attention to the area as an under eye concealer i would give it 2 stars
5	great color
5	this is a very nice product i have used many versions of this type of product using my mia 2 this particular brush head will give you a very deep cleaning it might be too harsh for sensitive skin , it is definitely stiffer than the green or pink ones i have used it does a very good job , and i am very satisfied with it i have noticed clearer skin using the clairsonic cleaner
4	the vichy lotion is a high quality lotion what makes this lotion different from some of the less expensive drug store moisturizing brands i 've tried is that it 's more about firming properties rather than moisturizing i tend to get itchy dry skin and use a moisturizer after the shower the vichy lotion does moisturize but the real difference is in the firming tightening of the skin the lotion comes out of the bottle in a more watery state than other lotions i 've used , not as thick but when it goes on it drys very quickly and nicely another property of the lotion is the scent i find the scent of the lotion to be a very pleasant one it 's a light clean smelling fragrance , though one that remains in the skin for some time after use so if you prefer a non scented lotion this one is not for you the bottle is quite an attractive in blush pink it looks great on my sink counter so i can keep it out at the ready instead of it away out of sight i would recommend the lotion and i feel like i would buy it again sometime , but because of the price i might rotate it out with some of the less expensive drugstore brands
5	i originally bought this line of shampoo , conditioner , and masque from my hair colorist , figuring it was to try it out at least once before going back to my usual drugstore brands i realized after awhile that using oribe products were making a huge difference in how long my salon red hair stayed vibrant and glossy ca n't go back to the cheap stuff now ! this shampoo seems pricey for the size , but in actuality it 's not it dispenses as a thick cream and a small amount \( a grape sized dollop \? \) is all you need you must emulsify it in your hands \( rubbing together \) and then apply it to very wet hair it does not foam up as detergent type shampoos do , which could mislead you into thinking you need to use more with just the small amount , my hair gets cleans without stripping out all the red color the matching oribe conditioner and the weekly masque are perfect complements for those of us who routinely \( every 6 weeks at least for me \) go to a colorist to get our hair done professionally , it 's silly not to use the right products to protect that color investment between salon visits i was always suspicious that high end hair products were a waste of money , after using oribe i'm now a believer !
4	this ended up being a little bit too dark for me i think that i would have been better with ivory it is difficult to figure out exactly what shade it will be based upon the on the screen it was super easy to put on it blends easily and did n't feel too thick on my face another reviewer said that it highlighted her wrinkles , but i did n't have that experience it seemed like it evened my face out pretty well before putting on any powder i wo n't be using it again because it is just not the right color , but i was n't disappointed in the foundation itself
4	intense is the word strivectin sd advanced intensive is not around you will definitely feel the impact right away in the the form of more moisture and supple skin for me , i cannot use it on my face during the day maybe it is too heavy for my face , but i did see the beginning of some whiteheads which i rarely get of course it is super humid these days , so clogging my pores with anything is not great during the day i will recommend strivectin for another use besides facial wrinkles if you are losing weight and do n't want the stretch marks you get after the fact this stuff is awesome worked like a charm on my winter weight to summer body transition
2	i was confused by this candles packaging its marketed as flammable if a candle doesnt burn , whats the point \? im assuming they add that to the to be funny , but it misses the mark the jar is covered in writing , describing the candle in great detail i do n't think this is attractive at all i think it looks rather silly , especially given that the text is black on black and difficult to make out the candle is made from soy wax , which means you shouldnt use it on a candle warmer it also means that the wax is very soft the heat from my fingertip left marks in fact , it melted sitting in the sunlight in my living room i expected it to have a much stronger fragrance than it does you have to practically stick your nose in it to tell its scented for some people thats a plus , though i enjoyed the actual smell , but i had to light it to get the full effect of course , for most people , thats the point myself , i like to enjoy the smell even when the candle is n't burning and given that i have a ten month old kitten in my household , burning candles are few and far between ! i liked the candle , ugly jar aside i do n't think its worth paying the 45 00 amazon price , however there are much prettier candles on the market for much less , that smell just as nice \( and which can be safely used on candle , or not lit at all and still enjoyed \)
5	love my mia and this is a replacement brush that 's not harsh on the skin very easy to install and use is what it needs to be
3	picture does n't match real color
5	love the product my go to color love it !
4	this cover up works quite well i am a fair skinned caucasian of english and irish descent and this blends in nicely with my skin tone it 's especially good at post shower blotchiness and acne although the price might seem high , a little bit of product goes a long way on one 's face , so you can expect it to last a very long time just used it today , as a matter of fact , with the usual positive results
5	this stuff works ! i 've had problems with other moisturizers making my eyes water when i apply them around my eyes juice beauty does n't do this but what it does do is a great job at smoothing out fine lines besides applying it around my eyes i also put it on my hands which seem to be aging more quickly than my face \( probably because i usually sun defying products on my face but not my hands \) the result was that it smoothed out my skin texture very quickly and for quite awhile even though i washed my hands several times despite this they remained smoother for at least four hours there 's a very slight smell when you first dispense the product but it fades quickly it also sinks into your skin fast it has a handy pump delivery system with a lid that clicks in place to prevent spills the only slight problem i have with the product is that it 's difficult to dispense a super small amount but there are always other body parts where you can apply the excess i'm also prone to break outs but did n't have that issue with juice beauty to sum up it 's effective , lasts for quite awhile , and a little goes a long way
5	this comb is attractive and has a nice weight and shape to it only you can decide if it 's worth the price over a drugstore comb , but the main differences are \( 1 \) weight \( 2 \) how finely rounded the edges are the comb feels substantial and it 's size makes it easy to grip any comb will probably do the job of getting out tangles , but the tines of this comb feel smoother on the scalp and has a nicer weight to it than sized combs that are less expensive the acetate material will become slightly cloudy from combing action \( hair being pulled along the frame will cause fine scratches that remove some of the out of the box shine \) , but it does n't affect the generally attractive tortoiseshell appearance another thing to note is that i have owned a similar comb by a british company \( brushes \) , and cellulose acetate is no more durable \( in fact , it may even be more brittle \) than harder overall , i recommend this comb , but i'm sure it 's worth the sticker price edited to add i 've had this comb for over a year and it still looks and works great prefer it to other combs i 've had and thus for durability i'm upgrading it to 5 stars \( instead of the 4 stars in my original review \)
1	first of all , i had to get past the horrible , chemical , plastic smell to even try the product i was barely able to do it ! it stinks like aqua net and or other cheap drug store hair sprays this did not add any volume whatsoever to my hair in fact , it seemed to weigh it down and i was stuck with that stench until i washed my hair for me , this product is garbage which is where it went after one use
5	perfect crisp white for all seasons !
4	this is an easy to use powder that can be applied with brush for light coverage and a sponge for heavier coverage i used the brush and found the light coverage to be right for me it lasts all day long and did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin a good product that is easy to use
5	i was skeptical i am 64 years old and still have skin the only product that has ever helped is glycolic acid md skin peel 70 \( which i highly recommend and which you can buy on amazon , but not in any stores i have ever identified \) much to my , this juice beauty blemish clearing serum actually works ! i have been using it for several weeks now and have seen pretty results so , two thumbs up a blemish free smile for this product give it a try if you have seemingly skin issues , this may be the solution you have been looking for
4	this is a light , fresh tea scent to me it smells predominantly of green tea , with a slight fruity complement the green tea note is a true one , it smells almost exactly like dry green tea leaves waiting to be i appreciate that this smells like actual green tea i 've found that what often as a tea in perfumes smells nothing like the real thing this one is the real thing the slight fruity complement makes it smell like a lightly flavored green tea this is a light , fresh scent that is easy to wear unfortunately it does not last very long after an hour or two it 's basically gone from my skin i 've used both the edp version of the beat , and this edt , and i like the scent of the edt better unfortunately , though , it does not have the staying power of the edp
4	let 's just say that i am a woman of a certain age whose face shows it i have long given up on looking like a 20 something , heck , even a 30 something so while i think it would be great for my visible lines to become invisible , my main expectations for a face cream these days are to moisturize and feel good based on these criteria , the nuxe cream works well it goes on a bit thick \( it 's definitely a cream , not a lotion \) , but it has a smooth , non greasy feel , and after i 've applied it , it does n't feel heavy on my face it also a light , not unpleasant fragrance i like how my facial skin feels after i 've applied it does it really get rid of visible lines \? on that , i'm i 've been using it for several weeks now , and i ca n't say i 've noticed much indeed , any difference but like i said , my expectations were low to begin with on that count \( i 've had my hopes by expensive serums and creams before \) i do like how it makes my skin feel , and that 's enough for me one caveat the nuxe cream does not , as far as i can tell , include any kind of sunscreen , so i would n't suggest relying solely on it i apply a moisturizer with sunscreen on top of the nuxe cream in the mornings
1	awful product i 've used their fibers with great success , but this stuff is useless all it does is make your hair look dull and straw like i contacted the company and asked for a refund , but did not get the of a response sorry i bought this product does not do what it purports to do
5	great
3	i personally do n't see what the hype is
5	i let my wife rate this since she is the one that will smell it the most she loves the smell of this and the fact that it lasts for a while this is one of the only after shaves where i would get a smell of it once in a while most of the ones i have had never linger enough for me to smell it again the fragrance is good without being too flowery \( more masculine , not feminine \) highly recommended \( by my wife \) !
2	i have had the occasion to use several vincent longo products and i realize that this line of products provides a high quality product for a pretty hefty price in most situations i have found you get a really good product for your investment however , in this case , i am just not sure about this one size vincent longo water canvas base comes in a black tube which looks pretty nice on the product page , but in reality , when you get it , the small size is rather shocking there is only 88 oz of product in the tube , which if you translate it , you can imagine three tubes of jack black lip balm and that is about the size of this product texture i have tried many times to see what might be different about this primer compared to many others out there i have to say after testing this repeatedly , i just do n't see any advantage of using this primer the feel of this product is that you use a pearl sized drop of this product applied around your entire face and eyes when i do this , i feel a lot of silicone feel to it this leaves my face feeling like it has wrap on it of sorts it is hard to explain , but after a while of wearing this primer , i feel like my face wants to breathe and i want to remove it affect on makeup this primer base definitely does smooth out the skin and does allow for the foundation and other face makeup to stay on the face nicely it seems to make the makeup stay on well through the day and it does add to a nice appearance of the skin i also find when using this , that blush does not tend to change color like some other primers can do i still did not enjoy wearing it over time , however , so i am not sure it served that great of a purpose final comments for the price , i just do n't see how this product is worth the money i have normal to dry skin and i did n't feel any particular moisturizing features from this base i get much nicer results when using swanson vitamins hyaluronic acid serum which is very similar to lorac which was discontinued i just do n't like this primer and did n't feel it is worth the investment you get so little product for a very high price using it under vincent longo water canvas foundation does make it look very nice , however , if you have the money to invest and want to use them together there are other options that are more cost effective , however if you prefer a less expensive alternative base to use
4	i do n't usually use base primers to my makeup , simply because i do n't think i really need them i have been pleasantly surprised by this base it is very lightweight , i ca n't feel it on my skin at all after applying it you do n't need much to cover your whole face , perhaps just a dime size there is no discernible scent either i can see this lasting quite a long time before i need to purchase more it did seem to smooth out my appearance after i applied moisturizer and before i applied the foundation that goes with this
5	designed for controlling frizz and adding shine , while the product is oil based it is light and did not weigh down my hair my hair is curly , shoulder length and although there is a lot of hair , the texture is thin so it is prone to frizz and can be easily flattened the product is to be applied to dry hair , so with a light spray i was pleased with the way it tamed the frizz and added a bit of shine all without negatively affecting the volume application of anti frizz shine products can be somewhat messy usually it requires pumping an oily liquid onto hands , rubbing them together and then running them through the hair this then washing hands , reapplying lotion , etc this spray bottle releases a fine mist so it can actually be applied in a very controlled way hold it close to the hair or some inches away with first use , the pump did need to be repeatedly pressed \( probably 10 15 times \) before product was released the fragrance is strong , something that is usually an issue for me , not because of sensitivities but simply because different fragrances can be annoying completely subjective , but i genuinely like this scent enough to make an exception it is difficult to describe the fragrance other than to say it is not a readily identifiable herbal or citrus concoction it is a complex perfume the male in residence also liked the scent but felt it too feminine for use in his not necessarily unisex it does dissipate over an hour or so i actually wish it lasted longer excellent product excellent fragrance
4	thought it would be creamier it 's more translucent than creamy have n't notice any improvement so far only time will tell
3	i wanted to love this product i used it everyday for 4 days straight and used types of product my medium long hair just could not hold a curl i think it 's my hair 's fault and not the product as the product worked fine and would get plenty hot enough i have thick , very fine hair my hair just wo n't hold a curl , period thankfully amazon has a good return policy , and i was able to get most of my money back
2	nice color but a little too light for me it has sparkles in it too , which i did not know u might like and u might not
4	pricey but easy to apply goes on well and lasts very glossy
5	great color !
5	beautiful !
5	great product , i swear by the cnd shellac colors ! this is a great fall color , a bit on the neutral side for color , goes with many other colors !
1	this concealer kit was difficult to apply , and badly packaged i struggled to get the product neatly from it 's pan and when i applied it , the colors did n't work well as concealers they were kind of goopy and did n't blend well with foundations as well they had an odd texture , they reminded me of makeup you buy a child sorry to say such because i really looked forward to the face products !
5	i hate the taste of most toothpaste i started using marvis when i saw some bundle packs of italian toothpaste on sale these taste very good the cinnamon mint and the licorice were great , but the jasmin mint is the best it is minty with a touch of jasmin this toothpaste does not foam up like most american brands do it is free of sls and fluoride i do alternate with a fluoride toothpaste for sensitive gums , so it is really up to you if you feel you need fluoride or want to avoid it completely the smaller sized tube is perfect for travel this toothpaste is pricey , but i will buy it again
2	quality of the polish is fine however the color is much darker than the image suggest and does not really look green at all
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	super refreshing to use when my face is feeling tight and dry without having to go through the whole of going through the whole skincare regiment
2	this absorbs well but leaves skins kind of greasy then melt off skin and into eyes which really hurts wo n't purchase again
5	i'm a guy , and i love this stuff bonus points for being able to use it as a shampoo and body wash it really makes you feel awake and refreshed when you use it , like a fresh pine forest but not a gross air freshener after all , this is philip b it 's legit amazon has the best prices too , so no need to keep shopping big bottle will last you a while too
4	reviewed by my wife i have several dermablend products the covercreme in several colors the liquid camo medium coverage foundation the intense powdercamo i got them for my daughter to use for stage makeup \( she has been doing character makeup for a small shakespeare troupe in our county \) it works amazingly ! this full coverage foundation is smooth , easy to apply and gives complete coverage with just a very , very tiny amount it comes with a paddle for mixing colors , but use it with a gentle touch , as just a simple swipe of the finger across the surface of the creme produced complete , opaque coverage on my hand \( see image attached the darkest color by the thumb \) it gives a nice satiney finish that is easy to layer with other makeup like blush and highlighter it has an almost undetectable fragrance , and produces no irritation on my very sensitive skin it removes well with just soap and water truly excellent product
5	love love love this color ! ! !
5	this is an excellent top coat i use with all brands of nail polish and can double the life of my manicure if i apply this again after a few days it gives a very glossy gel like look to nail polishes dries quickly and smoothly it does tend to get thick after a while but a new bottle is still way cheaper than a professional manicure
5	again since i do not wear make up , i gave this to the wife to try out she applied it and she advised that these are good colors , it applies very easy and the colors and make up lasted her all day she said that she liked this product
5	this color is a great year round color i love this color !
4	let 's ignore the price for a moment this is a very fine pillowcase it 's soft , it 's attractive , it 's comfortable the color is neutral and perfect for my chocolate cherry hued bedroom will the pillowcase rejuvenate you \? since this fabric is touted as patented , you might wonder about the science behind it though i searched a few different ways \( is a joint venture of cosmetic research company and 's patent to its antibacterial antimicrobial properties which is why you 'll see the material used in socks \) i could not find anything to the rejuvenation claim a clinical study 57 suggested a significant positive effect , but copper infused fabric is not the same as copper peptides , which have been proven to affect the skin , and i personally was not convinced by the photos subtle differences only , could be lighting related too , unless you sleep with your face in the pillow , any rejuvenating effect will be uneven , limited to the side that touched the fabric and if you sleep on your back , you 're not going to see an impact on your face at all my own experience is that the side of my face that comes in contact with the pillowcase looks a lot less than it would with a regular pillowcase when i first jump out of bed a half hour later , both sides look the same i notice that amazon sells a similar product at a much lower price , so if you 're skeptical about the technology but still want to give it a try , there 's this option nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href london luxury 34 skin glow 34 pillow cover copper technology dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 london luxury skin glow pillow cover copper technology a i like this pillowcase , i really do and compared to the price of a peel , laser treatment , fillers , or facelift , it 's a bargain but you 're also not going to get the same results as you 'd get with one of those treatments
5	this is the best hand cream in the world as a nurse i was always washing my hands , or using sanitizer , and my hands hurt this product soothed my skin like no other cream the scent is lovely , and it makes your skin feel great
5	love this color ! nice bright purple !
5	love this great stuff !
3	the good smells fresh but not overpowering , does n't break out my combo skin , does contribute to smooth skin over time the less than good it 's expensive \( but markedly cheaper on amazon \) , it 's not a game changer in terms of results the facts i have used 1 pump of this roughly 5 6 nights per week after cleansing and toning since early to mid may and i have about 1 3 of the bottle left i like it , but i think it 's too expensive for what it does it 's a luxurious product that smells great and does smooth out your skin a bit over time \( i'm in my mid 20s but am no porcelain doll , skin wise \) but i think there are other similarly priced serums on the market that give better results
5	love vinylux it is not hard on your nails like gel polish vinylux remover makes it easy to remove pleased with product and seller
5	this is a great mask to use the next day after using the aztec clay mask
3	overall , i like this iron so far build quality seems decent enough and is balanced well it is also a little unusual in its design specifically , the bumps on the wand are intended to prevent slipping but on a few occasions , we noticed it left varying degrees of bumps in our hair however , the results are very good the 9 foot cord is also very welcome and it does not get tangled
5	i really love this color and product
4	i like it to soothe irritated skin
5	i love lafco candles the hand blown glass is beautiful and their fragrances are amazing long burning my only wish is they had a refill
5	4 5 because of water like consistency this shampoo is very safe for all types of hair that has been colored i have about 4 different colors in my hair right now the base has been colored mostly ash with the bottom blue and purple when i used different shampoo , the color faded quite quickly i have now adjusted to washing my hair twice a week and with cold water in order to preserve the bright color longer this does a really great job of cleaning without stripping the color and leaves it soft the only issue i have with the shampoo is that it has the consistency of water and just pours out of the container i always end up using too much i wish it had a thicker feel to it for easier use
5	love this product it deff works just give it time it deff lightens and brightens my face and even old scars \) i deff would highly
2	they have a great thing going with this cleansing cream , you have to use twice or three times what they suggest it does not lather at all i will not buy it again
5	this is quicker than straight acetone and i hear better for your hands will definitely reorder
5	beautiful color !
5	i have combination skin that has been the bane of my for years it 's also finicky so it 's tough to find products that work without adding to the breakouts i had quit using toner all together because i could n't find one that effectively worked without being too strong and drying my skin out however , this clarifying solution so far has really been a charm ! no dry spots and it just seems to work much fewer breakouts and i like that there 's no harsh tight feeling on my skin after using i wipe it on with clean cotton squares \( \) and let it work its magic and so far my skin has not at all ! i highly recommend this product to those with skin like mine !
5	great for home manicures
5	i never know i could be excited about a nail polish remover i 've bought many different ones from drugstore to highly overpriced high end and always love acetone the best for its performance of removing the polish and hated it for drying out my cuticles this nail polish remover removes my polish as good as acetone ! i love the smell of it i love the bottle design , the convenience of the pump , and the color of the liquid it does n't dry out my nails or cuticles as does acetone i finally found the product that makes me happy to do my nails 10 stars !
4	has a relatively high level of zinc oxide and does a great job fighting diaper rash on my 2 year old 's bum she recently started for a little ear infection and \( as per usual \) , broke out in a big rash on her bum i started using this diaper cream instead of my usual burt 's bees zinc oxide cream i really like that the burt 's bees cream is very thick almost like an ointment and stays put very well however the burt 's bees is really heavily scented and my little one has had lots of reactions to scents and perfumes so i like that this mustela does not have extra dyes or perfumes i wish it was just a little bit more water resistant , hence the removal of one star i received this sample in exchange for a review if it 's helpful to your purchase please vote helpful ! \)
5	the la roche posay toner spray is specially made for oily skin , which i have the spray is light and fresh feeling i use it after i have taken a shower and before i put on any moisturizer it is a soothing spray the directions state it is good for oily skin , razor burn and diaper rash , so i trust is on my face it is like an antiseptic without the sting
4	this is a very pretty , subtle bag i do n't think it is probably very resilient , i think it will mark easily \( the first pen \) , but for something special , it definitely makes the grade i tend to carry narrow bags these days , ones without center of any sort , and this bag is perfect to fit in that type of purse because , without or a bottom , it does n't expand much to the side , leaving lots of room for my
5	i 've owned this silk'n electronic file for less than one month and my feet look and feel better already i'm a guy but hey we have feet too and we wear every couple of years my wife me to join her and my daughter for a mani pedi and i always feel bad for the person that has to work on me \( lots of maintenance hey i'm a guy \) in guy speak this thing is a sander for your feet it has two , coarse and fine , which come in the form of cartridge heads \( kind of like changing out the blade on your gillette type razor \) so far i 've stuck with the fine grit which has been all i need thus far turn this sander thing on and run it over any rough areas of your feet basically it off skin and you can actually see the \( skin \) floating up in the air within 10 minutes both my feet were girly smooth on the cons side my 9 year old daughter also took a liking to this thing so now when i go to use it i can see her dead skin up on the sander head so i have to give it a very good cleaning before i use it other includes the disposable batteries , easy operation \( just turn it on and it starts spinning then turn it off \) , good build quality appears durable my only gripe so far \( besides my daughter using it \) would be to have a bit more gender neutral color scheme \( or maybe even some airbrushed on the handle if that 's not too much to ask \) in summary , i like this thing and will continue to use it \( when no one is looking \) the current price of 29 appears reasonable relative to the other competitive offerings i on amazon overall i rate it 5 stars in consideration of price value if there 's any future with my product experience i 'll add update comments to my review
5	this color is really cute ! cute coral with shimmer on it originally was for me but my mother ended up taking it for herself
3	i expected a darker color \( based on the photo \) but mine was way too pinkish it comes in a nice case with mirror \( no brush \) when i used my own brush , it was very powdery \( which i dislike as it goes everywhere \) the color looked sort of ok when on but did not last the day \( had to re apply \) based on the price \( 24 \) i would not buy it there are a lot of other brands that are much more cheaper \( or even more costly \) that would perform better
5	this product is so good and worth every penny spent on it the moment you apply you will notice that it is really super smooth and easy to apply maybe the titanium dioxide \? and that is what it makes it so expensive maybe it blends very well into the skin i would suggest buying 2 shades to reach the right color you need it was easy to apply with fingers and do make sure to wash your finger and remove the makeup once you are done for the day the foundation also comes with spf 25 while not great , it is good for most days
5	this self tanner by st tropez was reviewed by my wife and she loved it she loved the mouse formula and its easy non streaking application after 3 hours there was a deep glow to the skin it can be rinsed off after 1 , 2 or 3 hours depending on the depth of the tan you prefer she did not rinse it at all and applied it after showering and loved the result there was no odor upon application the mousse is a brown color and was applied with gloves and there was no residue color on them she did not apply it with her bare hands , so cannot say whether the color would transfer to fingernails etc i would recommend a tanning mitt the formula was not greasy and dried quickly you do not need to use much so the 6 7 fl oz will last for many uses she has used other self tanners in the past and was very pleased with this product
4	typically the sephora brand \( both pro and regular \) has been my go to for makeup brushes because i like the quality for the price but i 've been hearing more about the japonesque brand lately so i was curious to try these out , especially since the only fan brush i have is quite mini this style of brush is very useful it 's nice for getting a soft dusting of setting powder \( which is how i 've been using it most often \) , but it 's also handy for cleaning up any product fallout you might get , in my case mostly from eye shadow i find the handle easy enough to hold , though since i am usually quick in sweeping on powder or cleaning up excess makeup , i'm not really using it long enough to notice any discomfort it also feels nice enough on my face i do wish the bristles were a tad softer , but they 're not harsh either the softness reminds me more of the regular sephora line vs sephora pro i will also add that i have n't washed it , yet so i'm curious to see how well it will continue to hold a fan shape \( or be to look like new \) after being washed overall for the price , i think this is a very nice brush
4	this is a pretty good golden eyeliner i am not the best at applying eyeliner i tend to have problems with skipping and wavy lines this liner was actually quite easy to apply i used an eyeliner brush , and it swept on with no problems i did find that putting the liner on the brush was more of a production than i expected i dipped my brush in , but the texture of the liner meant that my brush seemed to resist it it did n't pick up color like i hoped i ended up having to swirl my brush around in the product and really load it up i was afraid that this would lead to a mess on my eyes thankfully it did not , but it is a bit annoying to get the product on your brush that said , this liner drew a fool proof line on my eyes the color was lighter than i expected , which means that with one coat you can use this for daytime for evening i would build up multiple coats to get a more obvious flashy gold i would definitely recommend putting down an eye base before using this liner it is not waterproof , and it does tend to wear off removal is easy with pretty much any cosmetic remover also , this eyeliner did not irritate my eyes , which i appreciated , though i only used it on my top lid overall , this is not a bad metallic liner
5	beautiful colors by opi infinite shine collection
4	nia 24 treatment catalyst , 0 5 oz seems to help make my skin softer you do not need a lot been using for about 5 days and can notice how softer my face feels it is a bit pricey at 72 via amazon prime shipping it has a slight scent , yet not overwhelming one of the few products where i actually saw results wish the bottle were bigger
4	if you buy this product in an authentic form from a reputable seller then it will be a dream come true i have been using this foundation for about a year and would not consider switching to anything else along with my tarte airbrush brush , it creates almost flawless base i have slight melasma and it covers most of the discoloration it never cakes \( if applied with the tarte brush \) and it is pretty good at controlling oil production my one suggestion is to go into a store that sells this product to get color matched because their color palette is off i am using a color called golden glow and i am pretty white yet it somehow matched my undertones perfectly also keep in mind that this foundation goes fast so be prepared to replace it every two months or so if used daily
4	this trial size vichy skincare set comes nicely packaged in a reusable blue tin and would make a nice gift or , say , shower door the cost is high for a travel size set , but it does give you some of vichy 's more popular and in the case of the cream and serum pricier products in terms of the products themselves , the ideal body lotion is a rather small tube \( just a few uses \) of good , but not outstanding , body lotion not something i 'd buy again , due to its cost , but a good product , with a light scent that absorbs well and goes on non greasy the makeup remover is extremely liquid \( water consistency \) and uses a cotton ball to apply again , this is a true sample size , but would last through a week or more of daily use , assuming you 'd mainly use it to remove eye makeup as intended it did that job fairly well , needing a couple passes for waterproof mascara , but overall getting it done without stinging or irritating contact lens eyes the serum is about half a normal size but will last quite a while , as you use very little it left my skin feeling dewy and can be combined with moisturizer , which is my preferred application method i liked it , and the sample size is enough for probably a month or more if you use it every other day , as i tend to \( full size version of this product sells for around 45 \) the face cream was the nicest of the bunch , to my mind dewy , without being greasy and worked well on my combination skin i do wish it had sunscreen built in , but otherwise thought it was a good , mid priced \( 45 for full size jar \) moisturizer , where a little goes a long way and i think this good sized tub should last most women 3 4 weeks with daily use overall , i 'd say if this was under 20 it would be outstanding at a bit more than that , i still think it 's a good set , since i did like the two most expensive products
3	i purchased the rinse and the toothpaste and accelerator i 've been using it for 6 or 7 months i do not see any change in the color of my teeth i 've gone through three bottles of the rinse and two each of the 8 oz toothpaste and accelerator i will not purchase any more supersmile products
5	this is the hot shade in fashion now and it delivers with short groomed nails it is just great and i love wearing it it lasts perfectly for the two weeks no chips at all ! best idea was the polish for natural nail girls out there
5	what can i say , this product is simply magic i think it is \( other than it is white , it 's self \) it 's not a lightening mask it seems to be this amazing produce that cleans out my pores , hydrates the dry areas and tightens up my greasy t zone this is one of those masks that just works on every type and gives great , clean , supple skin i think i go through a jar a month also , it smells fantastic ! when i really want to treat myself , i put it in with a fan brush i ca n't say the of the product more
5	i wish i gave this spray a try long ago , i have never used a dry shampoo ever and that 's not the intention i had when purchasing this i bought this because of all well mostly all great reviews how this gives volume i found the reviews were correct , first day using this i had alot of volume and texture this did not weigh my hair down or leave any residue or greasy feeling i had to figure this out for myself a few times before i got this right after my hair is washed , conditioned with oribe shampoo i style my hair and just lightly use a few sprays and this really did hold my hair in place i do touch up my hair during the day and sprayed a little more and i was very happy it was n't crunchy or sticky just yesterday i place an order for the full size but still like the smaller can for traveling very and both sizes are made available
5	i'm seriously getting sold on demablend ! i 've been using four products the last month and have been really happy with them this is no different i 've used green cover up makeup before for a few imperfections i have found that sometimes they are too chalky and do not blend well , and the other one disappeared once my liquid makeup was applied it did n't happen with this ! i applied both with fingertips and with a sponge , both worked great ! i followed up with dermablend liquid makeup and loved it the green covers pimples , red splotches , and red discoloration this makeup is not thick , and applies easily the tube is small , but you only need a small amount i did not experience any rash or irritation it takes a few applications to get used to applying green makeup before your regular makeup but it works wonders !
4	i like the texture and feel of this not too heavy and very smooth been using for 2 weeks and do n't see much change will continue using and update this review if i see changes
5	i love black polish in the summer time i love it in the fall i love it in the winter i love it in the spring ! this is a very nice black not goopy !
3	let 's accentuate the positive and start out with the good news while it looks and feels thick as you apply it , this moisture gel absorbs quickly it left my skin feeling cool , too but i 've used it for weeks and i do n't see any tremendous improvement in my skin i 've been applying it on my decolletage and i do n't think this ahava gel works any better than the much lower priced pond 's i 'd been using
4	i guess this is one of those reviews so please do n't read this unless you are an older woman with no acne problems but with minor problems of pores and some milia i avoid excessive exposure to the sun and do not smoke , so my skin is fairly good for an old \( er \) woman not wrinkle free but certainly not as wrinkled as it could be at my age however , when i look in my magnifying mirror , that skin which seemed clear and blemish free to my old eyes in a regular mirror tells me a different story nose and chin have some enlarged , clogged pores and the cheeks have a few pores with very small clogs which look like small whiteheads but are actually very hard and round deposits called milia \( see , i told you this was a review \) these clogged pores are a very stubborn problem i 've tried scrubbing the heck out of my face with microdermabrasion products that does make the skin feel soft and smooth and pink but a close look in that mirror shows not much improvement in refining the pores i 've even read online that the skin too much can even cause milia so when i saw this product offered for trial in the vine program i decided to give it a try after all , the salicylic acid \( 0 5 \) and glycolic acid \( 2 \) ingredients here are not just for acne they are generally used for deep cleaning pores and lightly peeling the skin and , after using this for the trial time by amazon , i have to say it seems to be helping i 've noticed a definite improvement in my chin area in particular pores are more refined , skin is smooth overall , the skin of the whole face seems smoother and more toned keep in mind that i do n't have acne and only a very minor issue with clogged pores and milia if i just threw away my magnifying mirror , that would take care of my problems because nobody else cares about my face not even my dh of 46 years who to my complaints while no doubt thinking , does n't she have something more important to worry about , like world peace or who the next us will be \? i like this i wo n't give it 5 stars because it 's one of those products with a ingredients \( well , there are 15 listed on the bottle \) i 've become more of a about beauty products nowadays for example , the only facial moisturizer i use is either 100 pure rosehips seed oil or tamanu seed oil \( well , the bottles say 100 pure and i'm hoping there 's truth in that advertising \) if this effaclar clarifying toner had just 4 or 5 ingredients instead of those 15 , i might give it 5 stars the price is right and the results have been good so far
4	this is really good for hiding bruises or other marks riding and working with horses daily leaves me random bruises all the time especially on my legs this is a problem if i need want to wear a or dress i have to decide between or attempting to cover the bruise or just wearing pants this camo medium coverage actually did a good job covering a fresh bruise on my thigh i bumped into a rock trying to clear a trail by the this morning the resulting scratch and dark area is seriously ugly one thin layer covered and hid 90 of the discoloration unfortunately , the copper color is a tad too dark for my skin tone , but i am perfectly willing to find the correct shade for future use
5	i have mildly red cheeks , so i use a cover up that will even them out i apply the cover up to them , then apply a finishing powder , and then my foundation this cover creme works perfectly for this i apply it with a stiff concealer brush , by dabbing it all over my cheek it sits well underneath my foundation and stays in place all day you get a lot in this jar , so this will last you a really long time that makes the price worth it dermablend is a great brand , and has become one of my favorites !
5	one of my new favorite curling irons now
5	i'm seeing quite a difference after 3 weeks ! i use it on the dcolletage too and that skin looks much smoother , highly recommend
5	i have been using buying baxter products for about a year now , and i continue to enjoy it i 've bought and these body washes , and i'm very pleased with them the fragrance is great , and this is a non harsh product , great for sensitive skin out of the body washes , this is among my favorite
5	l'occitane has a well deserved reputation for wonderful skin care products this is a lovely hand and body lotion that applies easily and soaks in readily non greasy , it leave your hands out of \( you can even touch your mouse ! \) almost immediately improved dry skin on the forearms well tolerated with no sensitivity no annoying scent with all new skin care products , patch testing is usually recommended before application , apply a small amount to an area you can \( such as the under belly of the forearm \) if no itching or redness , it is not likely that an allergy has occurred you might then want to try more liberal use and greater distribution but , when in doubt , always stop use and consult a physician overall , i think be pleased with this very special hand lotion , great !
5	wow , this foaming shower gel was a surprise it really squirts out ! a quick press and release shoots out enough of this gel to shower nicely and get you clean the fragrance is strong and lasts so keep that in mind my first mistake was pressing it down and having a lot come out i learned quickly it washes off easily and did n't leave any kind of film
5	my favorite cnd color have ordered it several times and i always use it quickly it 's a great color and gets lots of compliments
4	i 've got very sensitive skin , and most exfoliating treatments even those for sensitive skin cause an allergic reaction on my face sometimes it 's mere redness , sometimes it 's an allergic rash obagi derm is mild enough for even my skin after a week of daily use \( after toner and before applying moisturizer \) , there has been absolutely no reaction at all even better , my skin does seem seem softer and a bit younger looking i do n't need a lot to apply to my entire face and neck area , and i expect the 2 oz bottle to last at least a month the scent is very light , almost non existent while i'm not bothered by scented products , i know people who are will appreciate the light scent
3	it 's very light and unlike my blush , it does n't last i hate to say that , because the eye shadow of theirs i have is wonderful that 's really all there is to say i'm very fair skinned , i have to apply a lot to get it to show if it at all , i ca n't see it and i 've tried it over liquid foundation and mineral foundation \( i really should n't give it 2 stars , but like the other products of theirs i 've gotten , the packaging is exquisite and the compact is really beautiful and well built i'm highly disappointed that the blush itself leaves much to be desired i cannot recommend this color not sure i can recommend the product update i 've taken to applying this blush with a sponge or my fingers , this seems to work better than a brush it is a nice pink color and looks natural on my cheeks when applied with my fingers or the sponge that being said , it does not last like my blush , it has to be reapplied a couple of times during the day i 've to 3 stars , that being said , i would not purchase it
5	i am a big fan of this product and have purchased several of their colors i love the extended wear that i get and the lasting shine i have yet to be able to make it a full chip free week , but i am hard on my nails it 's important to use thin layers , including the top coat i do n't think i can stress that enough i love this color , it is what the name implies , blood red i wear it for dinner dates with hubby or late fall winter i will continue to purchase , use and recommend thin layers ! !
5	fragrance free and extremely effective when it comes to moisturizing dry skin spring is always a time when my super dry winter skin begins to heal a bit , due to changes in the weather this spring refuses to come , and so my winter skin dryness is hanging around i have never even heard of this product line before trying it now this bioderma cream is a bit heavier than what i usually use and possibly because of that , it keeps working longer i do n't find it to be sticky or impossible to absorb , but it seems to take a minute or so to soak in once a day application will keep my skin smooth all day long i love that it is fragrance free
5	first off , if you 've never used a micellar water solution before , i strongly recommend giving them a shot micellar waters are a soap free non rinse cleansing solution that gently and effectively removes makeup , dirt , and other debris on the skin by using micelle molecules that , when applied to the skin , debris within the molecules which removes it from the skin without stripping and irritating even the most sensitive skin it 's all very scientific there 's a of information that you can find on micelle molecules and how they work micellar solutions can be used in a number of ways \( i e a makeup remover , toner , cleanser \) and working them into your skin care routine can really save you a lot of time after using a whole bottle of the pink version \( which is for normal and sensitive skin \) i decided to try this green version out \( for oily and combination skin \) when i needed to reorder because within the last year my skin has become excessively more oily in my t zone and chin , yet exceptionally dry everywhere else i really wanted to see what , if any , difference there was between the two since i still had a few applications worth in the pink bottle i decided to do a side by side comparison for a few days by using the pink version on one side of my face and using the green on the other i typically use my micellar solution to remove my makeup and prep my skin for washing and cleansing with either my murad time release acne and ant aging cleanser , or my caudalie foaming cleanser if i'm feeling particularly too lazy tired , or if i'm not wearing any makeup i 'll use it on its own both perform the same at successfully removing makeup and dirt , however i found that i had to use more of the pink solution than the green to achieve my desired results both are similarly gentle and refreshing and remove eye makeup without struggle or irritation , but again it seemed like the green removed more more quickly than the pink the pink does tingle more than the green if you use these solutions you know what i'm talking about for those of you that do n't , i say tingle because it 's the only word i can think of to describe the sensation it is not a burning , menthol , or medicated type of tingling it 's not uncomfortable or irritating by any means and is more strongly felt in more sensitive areas or areas that are more clogged than others also , it stops pretty quickly and is not felt once the solution has evaporated i'm assuming that this tingle sensation is in part linked to the of debris by the molecules before if you 've ever eaten pop rocks , imagine a gentler , much less extreme version of that sensation on your skin in my side by side comparison i noticed that the side on which i used the green solution stayed grease free longer than that of the pink the green side also feels less taught after drying than the pink although , i had n't noticed any tightness in feeling with the pink version before trying the green and comparing , so the difference is slight yet enough to notice the pink version is clear , however the green is light blue in color the ingredients are significantly different i wo n't list them all here but i will point out that the pink version has cucumber extract whereas the green has ginkgo biloba extract instead the green seems to have more ingredients than the pink and is not fragrance free like the pink one but despite the fact the pink does not have any added fragrance , it does have a smell the pink version definitely smells stronger than the fragrance of the green oddly enough , the green smells like cucumber and rose the fragrance of the green version is so slight it 's almost unnoticeable upon application which causes me to believe it is included to either counteract any scent caused by an ingredient the pink version does not have , or for those who do n't like the way the pink one smells the pink has a slight tinge of chemical smell but primarily \( and this is just what it smells like to me and the best way i can describe it \) it smells like dirt yep dirt earth almost the way dirt smells after it rains it 's not horrible or overly offensive to me personally , it 's just much stronger if you 're trying to choose between the two , the added fragrance and the smell of each might be a big determining factor another pro for the green is that i paid almost 10 less for the bigger bottle \( 500 ml \) than i ended up paying for the smaller \( 250 ml \) bottle of the pink i realize this is relative and depends on sellers , , and location \( the pink bottle was purchased at 34 before shipping from over sea 's \) do i like one more than the other \? not really , although , i think the green version suits my personal skin needs better than the other at this point in time they both are exceptional at what they do micellar solutions have become an part of my beauty regiment these bottles last quite awhile and have removed my need to buy cleansing wipes and other makeup removers , which tend to break me out eventually i hope this review was helpful to those trying to decide which product is right for you everyone 's skin and needs are different and to say this ones better or that ones better as a blanket statement does n't really help anyone make an informed choice , imo
5	as a makeup artist , i have worked with all kinds of concealers i have seen some of the best and some of the worst this concealer comes in a pen which turns up from the bottom there is a little window on the pen which allows you to see the exact product that is inside \( including color \) and you can see when the product is coming up toward the top this is worth mentioning because so many of these twist pens are easy to twist up too much because it takes a lot of twists to get the product up if you twist too much , the pressure continues and you waste a lot of product applicator the applicator is a flocked sponge type finish that allows the product to come up through a bunch of small holes and disperse nicely across the pad how to apply the best way to apply this concealer is to dab on the inner corner lightly \( make sure to moisturize well before using this \) and then gently tap the product with your finger and make it spread across the under eye area , getting less intense as it moves toward the outer corner color the color i tested out was medium for reference , my skin tone is mac nw25 , bare escentuals medium beige , and too faced bb cream in nude glow i found the medium to be a touch too light in tone for my skin , but i could still use it if i set it with medium skin finish from mac on lighter skin tones it worked nicely \( as in \) as it is coverage as for coverage it is light to medium in coverage if you are covering very dark circles , this might not work as well for you settling into lines this is one of the few concealers that does not settle into the creases making you look ancient i tried this on a variety of people from aging dry skin eye area down to late teens with oiler skin it worked very well , especially on the dry aging areas that is very hard to find concealer for as it tends to age quickly as it settles into the creases it did not stay on as well for oilier areas final comments if purchased in the correct color , this concealer is expensive , but it does work especially well if you want the concealer to be undetectable on dry or aging skin i did not find any adverse reactions for anyone that i tried it on \( myself included \) and it did seem to last fairly well all day it is a for my top list of concealers , with graftobian being at the top
1	sticky i do n't like this at all i got a spray bottle and distilled water like i have done for years that works fine
5	great polish high gloss sheer in color
5	love this and i have repurchased it 4 times now
5	exactly what i need !
3	cnd shellac power polish summer splash collection pink bikini is not pink but not red i do not know what it is , but not what i hoped for applies well and goes with about anything
3	i was looking for a rich royal blue nail polish had seen swatches of essie 's bouncer it 's me on the interwebs and thought this was the one ! first coat was thin and very watery not at all what i expected second coat still watery and sheer i'm a fan of l'oreal 's miss candy nail polishes they 're sheer and gel looking i thought this would be something like that , but it dries matte ish a coating of seche vite improved it and gave it plenty of shine , but was still quite sheer if you want a more opaque look , you 'll definitely need at least 3 4 coats
5	absolutely love baxter products and these bar soaps are the ultimate luxurious lather , clean , fresh scent and even a very attractive appearance in a soap dish with baxter , i also can rely on top quality ingredients
5	non greasy , pleasant smelling and effective i'm impressed that most of the ingredients are organic i feel good about that other face spf products end up stinging my eyes when i perspire or get my face wet but not coola great product !
4	good coverage with a nice rosy pink color for those of us with fairer skin , but do n't expect a miracle if you are older as am i good screen protection and not too cakey if you follow directions
5	i bought these for my boyfriend , they are his absolute favorite blades for shaving his face the price is great , shipping was fast , and they arrived in appropriate packaging will order again !
5	the hold on this is great , and it is indeed very shiny ! it makes hair easy to style for short looks , and works for relatively stuff if you finish with some spray it also resists humidity well , which is a great plus downside \? if you like fresh clean scents or traditionally masculine scents , this is n't it it is very sweet and heavy i hate it some might like it personal preferences , you know \? but if you like citrusy , musky , or clean scents like rain , ocean , linen , etc , and dislike very sweet stuff , you 'll be with me on this one
5	long product superior coverage , blends like magic even after many hours of wear it did not break down , no product caking in small wrinkles very pleased with this concealer , a little goes a long way , complete coverage for deep dark coloration under eyes will also be checking out the other offerings of this brand japonesque highly recommend this concealer
5	i love this product
3	this is a nicely moisturizing product , but i cannot say that it has much of an actual brightening effect i do not experience puffiness around my eyes , so i ca n't access whether it works for that purpose happily , there is only a very mild scent , which is produced from fragrance , listed in the ingredients in fact , the list of ingredients is a bit , since many of them are chemicals known to be irritants or are considered less than clean on a toxicity scale most commercial \( and even high end \) cosmetics and skincare products include them , so clearly this is an area of personal preference the packaging is attractive and is good in theory , but there are two problems with this type of dispenser first , it dispenses more product than you need , so you have to be very careful in trying to dispense a half pump , so as not to waste it secondly , when you get close to the end , it is really hard to access the product it is overpriced , in my opinion , and there are far better eye brightening products available from dhc for much less
4	the h2o things is a shampoo and i happen to like it no , it 's not one of those or things that makes you feel like you are saving the planet and its while using it because it has a long list of difficult to pronounce and definitely ingredients but it does the job for me the h2o is mild enough not to trigger any allergic reactions while it cleans my hair thoroughly and helps maintain a feeling of comfort and well being for the rest of the day the eucalyptus and aloe combo smell good and my hair feels light and bouncy but , of course , it 's so what 's good for me it 's not so good for let 's say , our daughter , whose hair is thicker and more straight than mine , did n't like it at all and told me that her hair felt after h2o so , like the title of my review suggests , some may love it but it 's not going to be i would have granted the much coveted 5 stars anyways because how feel about the product is what matters most when writing a review but the high price is not justified , in my view yes , it 's a quality shampoo but i ca n't justify spending that much for a bottle because it does not do miracles
5	you need this period
4	love the color and it is buttery and very easy to apply i'm happy with this nail color
5	love it , like most jack black products the part is buying these as gifts for family and friends and their stating , i did n't know the jack black had his own line of men 's care products lol he does n't it 's not the same
5	these are amazing as good as any other major makeup brand without the chemicals very moisturizing and i have super dry lips
3	i was really excited to try this product because as soon as it came on the market , i thought it was the thing ever unfortunately , it was a bit of a disappointment for me it did remove a lot of my makeup , but a lot was also left behind and it did n't seem any different than using just a regular wet towel visit my blog at christinaschiccorner com to read my more detailed review i posted about it
5	this curling iron curls my hair perfectly ! it heats up fast , gets real hot and creates perfect waves or perfect \( depending on if i curl the hair or wrap it with the tool upside down \) i totally recommend it !
3	i ordered one color and they sent me a different one luckily i liked the color they sent me but it just was n't the one i ordered it came on time thought
5	goodness very light serum light to non existent scent one pump covers your entire face absorbs instantly really a wonderful serum i think it is very nourishing to your skin i have used this three times a day for a week and my skin is softer i use in the morning , and after swimming in the afternoon and again right before bed i put it on before the spf or the wrinkle cures with so much outside activity , chlorine , salty ocean water and probably entirely too much sun , i need an extra boost to my regular products and this works perfectly with all of them
1	when applied , this looks horrible and watery nothing like when purchased in a store i would not recommend buying these online very disappointed
4	the vichy proeven daily dark spot corrector cream is designed to those skin tone by evening it out and improving the appearance of dark spots as such it is suggested for optimal use to be used twice daily , otherwise it should be used at night on cleansed skin the product combines a resurfacing lha with exclusive ceramide bright technology as well as containing an antioxidant vitamin c which can protect skin from damage by free radicals it also contains enriched mother of pearl to immediately blur imperfections and illuminate skin this cream is free of hydroquinone and paraben free the product goes on pretty smoothly and is absorbed relatively fast and easily only after repeated use will any real change be noticed
5	awesome product ! baxter does it again !
4	i finally found the right shade for my skin tone ! i recommend using a primer with this foundation , because with me , it is a little dry otherwise just a tiny bit of product worked a co worker told me my face looked smooth and flawless so , keeping this one on hand it 's only one ounce , but it should last a long time recommended
4	the baxter of california facial scrub reminds me of st ives apricot scrub in color and texture it works great on my skin , but i can see it being too rough for some sensitive skinned people the ingredients give it an almond smell , which i enjoy quite a bit i 've been using it twice a week since i got it and i'm happy with the results i have n't had any extra unusual acne and my skin is nice and smooth this scrub does contain a sulfate , which can be drying , but it has n't dried my skin out it also contains parabens , for those who care about that the only thing i do n't like is the cap design you ca n't stand the tube on it 's head and it does n't flip open easily i 've found it easier just to twist the whole cap off
3	if your skin is dry and prone to fine wrinkles , this may work for you my skin , even in middle age , is oily and more prone to creases this type of serum does n't really work for me it feels a bit too thick for daytime wear i think it gave me a zit , besides , although hard to say for sure of course , not every product is for every skin type just my opinion
5	i use this scrub to wash my face in the evening , and really enjoy it the scent is amazing , i find it masculine which works for me i like the size of the particles , not too small and not too big they are easy to work across the skin , others i have tried seem to dissolve too quickly it does a great job of cleaning the oils from my skin and leaves it feeling great i 'd highly recommend this scrub
5	this is one of the nicest soaps i have used it smells great and delivers a deep down clean it also removes all smells that you do n't want it is gently though great buy !
4	i wanted to try this for some spider veins on my legs some are light , some are a bit darker this worked relatively well to cover them however , the almond \( the lightest color available \) is kind of an odd shade to blend in with my skin tone it blends better when i have a tan otherwise , it just takes a bit more effort to apply it and blend it it works well on some small sunspots too the key , i think , is to really use a light hand when applying and add a little bit more until you reach the desired coverage , then blend , blend , blend ! this stays put and does n't wear off readily if they offered more shades , i think that would be great
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
3	first of all , i did not break out in hives that 's the most important part , in my opinion \) you wo n't need a lot of this to cover your face a little goes a long way it feels very light and smooth , not greasy it has a light fragrance , even though it 's supposed to be fragrance free i love how easily it smoothed onto my skin , and after rubbing them in and smoothing out with my finger tips , it actually makes my skin look a little sparkly not in the sense that it looks metallic , but that there seems to be a natural sheen it brings out of my skin it does n't , however , seem to smooth away any of my wrinkles so i am not sure about the anti aging part , and it does n't really make it easier to put on my make up , which is why i gave it three stars instead of five i remember years ago trying a sample primer from olay i wish i remember the exact model of the primer , but that worked like magic i put it on , and it completely changed my skin to looking perfect this one does n't do that it might not be totally a bad thing , though this primer made my skin look healthy in a more natural way , rather than perfect if you do n't mind looking a bit more natural rather than perfect , you 'll probably like this one if you want that super smooth perfect skin ready for the camera look , you might not want this as much personally , i like to look perfect rather than natural , so i 'll probably go with another primer i do like how i can wear this day to day without any other make up to look like i have somewhat hydrated skin though
5	just gorgeous , richer than essie 's i'm addicted and i ca n't decide which one i like better !
5	great
5	i'm caucasian and pretty white , but for some reason , a lot of red nail polishes have just made my hands look kind of dirty and unappealing another problem i 've often had with them is that they end up looking brownish instead of properly red come to bed red is different to me , its the perfect red , a true red that is n't pink , is n't brown , and is n't neon i get a lot of compliments on my long , natural nails and part of how i keep them from getting damaged is to apply many layers of this , which creates a thick finish that is surprisingly durable , often lasting several days with little to no tip wear and zero chipping one complaint i have is that i 've found bl polishes take a very long time to dry , but the fact that the polish is thick and that i apply many layers overall probably worsens that also , it 's frustrating that it seems to get thicker as you use the bottle up even so , i love it and repurchase again and again in this colour
5	the color is really beautiful , it lasts a lot , doesnt fade i always buy this nail polish and have never had any concerns about it
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	leaves my skin silky smooth pretty expensive for a body butter , but i feel so special when i use this the scent is more of a coconut smell more than , but it is still nice these do n't go on sale often , but i an amazing deal after the holidays when sephora was trying to get rid of their holiday packages
5	what makes this such a good is that it is alpha and beta one works from the inside out and the other from the outside in covering all aspects of skin refining i 've used this product for too many years to count if you have dry skin and you have little milia this is about the only product that i have found that will exfoliate the skin chemically to help get rid of milia and keep it from coming back use it once a day only at night one pump all over face , neck and upper chest should do it also the size is enough to last me a year if you have more questions i'm an esthetician , feel free to ask me ! enjoy !
5	deep red with a tiny amount of sparkle needs 2 coats to avoid looking streaky for this polish you need a uv lamp to cure the polish
3	this has a rich and silky feel that i like but im not a big fan of the scent it says it has a scent of sweet orange cedar wood but i do n't really get the orange or cedar i was hoping for a strong orange scent with the mention of sweet orange and the orange packaging the cedar could be a yay or nay for me , depending on how it comes out this just sort of smells generic like any type of lotion but then it sort of smells a like floral to me which i dislike
5	wonderful for this dry , crisp weather that autumn in and winter , too
4	i gave this to my daughter who has long curly hair that can get a little frizzy from time to time she has tried it a couple of times and she really likes it her hair is noticeably less frizzy and has a nice shine it also adds volume and definition to her curls without crunch or crust it is very lightweight and does n't weigh her hair down she uses it as a leave in conditioner on her damp hair and also uses her usual styling products afterwards it is a great product but pricey
5	i 've been using mario badescu products for several years but am to this moisturizer it is quickly absorbed and left my skin feeling soft , hydrated it did n't leaving my face feeling tacky or oily the moisturizer comes in a simple squeezable plastic bottle
5	great summer color and cheaper on amazon than at target
4	i have n't been using this product for long , and i'm not 100 sure what this is supposed to do exactly \( i 'll update my review after a couple months \) , but in combination with the nioxin conditioner , and the nioxin \( i'm about to start using the scalp therapy \) , my hair feels great it really does make my hair feel a lot thicker , especially at the root a few yrs ago , i noticed that my hair , which has always been on the fine side , was starting to thin around my crown i was shedding so much , and i was in a i was always feeling my hair , hoping you could n't see my scalp stress , and stopping birth control pills was the cause of my hairloss i had tests run to rule out other things got a clean bill of health i started using the nioxin and after about a month i realized that my hair had started to thicken up where it was looking really thin before it worked so well that i was n't worrying about my hair at all anymore ! i purchased the largest bottles of nioxin that you can get , so it lasted me for a long time , i only had to replace the a few x 's once i ran out of things , i switched to a different hair care , and went about my business recently stress took over again , and i started noticing that my hair had started thinning again , and i realized that i had n't been using the nioxin i wo n't make that mistake again i 've added this booster to my regimen , because i figured it wo n't hurt i know i'm not talking about the intensive therapy booster specifically , because i feel like the nioxin work in with each other i ca n't say enough great things about nioxin and what it does for my hair , and my confidence being a woman in my 30 's thinning hair is not ok ! i can totally with anyone else that is dealing with this issue my dad is a dermatologist , and he deals with patients with thinning hair a lot , and besides a few drugs , there 's not much that can be done yet i hope that pretty soon there will be better treatments out there for us until then i'm keeping stocked up on this !
4	this sampler set fixes an issue ive encountered in the past you see a hair product from a high end mens line , but you do n't want to spend money unless you know you will love the product this set contains 4 different types of pomade you can mix and match , and see what works best for your hair i have thin hair so i found that i liked the cream pomade and hard cream pomade the best the hard water pomade was definitely the worst option for my hair the scents are pleasant the size is ideal for travel , as it takes up little space in your dopp kit in terms of size , id say each bottle is enough for about 8 10 applications so youll definitely have a good idea on how it performs
5	i have this shade already and i still absolutely love it
4	very good , unscented cream that goes on smooth and i can see visible improvement after only about a week it 's a little thick so i can feel it stay on all day , absorbing very slowly , but it does n't bother me very happy with it
3	strivectinlabs extreme cream has a nice luxurious feel to it it goes on easily and a little goes a long way it keeps my skin feeling moist all day long without reapplying i apply it in the morning and before bedtime it has n't caused any irritation and it makes my skin feel good but after using it for about a week i do n't really see any visible difference or reduction in wrinkles on my face \( i have plenty to experiment on \) to be fair , i have been using other products prior to trying this strivectin the products i used were pure coconut oil , pure jojoba seed oil , pure argan oil , and a product called 's vitamin e cream i did n't use them all at once , but rotated them , using each for several days and then switching to another so , my results so far with strivectinlabs extreme cream is that it 's not any better and not any worse than these other options but given the current price of 89 per ounce compared to around a dollar per ounce for these other products , i could n't recommend it based on my experience so far i am going to continue using it until it runs out and if i see miraculous results i will update my review update 7 17 15 after writing this review , i continued using this product for over a month i did n't really see any big improvement the good news is that it goes a long way and i still had some left in the jar a couple weeks ago i decided to try putting this strivectin on half of my face and apply pure coconut oil by viva to the other half after 2 weeks both sides looked about equally softened the wrinkles were n't gone but both products provided enough moisture that they seemed less noticeable the coconut oil is takes 20 to 30 minutes to be absorbed , so it 's less convenient but it costs a little over 10 for 16 ounces and it 's a simple , natural product and that appeals to me
4	i have used this twice on my girlfriends armpits , one a week as noted in the directions she has dark hair and fair skin you can definitely tell something is happening when you get it going a bright light emits in a flash this kit comes with glasses to protect your eyes because it is very bright there should also be a slight smell of burning hair that follows the flash she said she felt a faint pinch like sensation , but tolerable and she did not at it after a few weeks to see how the results came , she said it some hair grew back , but thinner so there were definitely results according to the instruction booklet , a good shaving is necessary to do before you use this and for those with red hair and pale skin , a waxing is recommended so , although the package says it can do any hair and skin , each person much do the appropriate preparations before just going straight to this step in the time we were allowed to review this product , i ca n't say with 100 that i can give a completely fair review as this is a time but so far my girlfriend is pleased with the results so far and will continue using it
5	great item
4	i have purchased 3 of this product as a gift to my friends delivery was fast and the scent was great ! after a week i repurchased another bottle for myself
4	i have light olive skin , when i first rolled it on , it looked a tad too orangey for my skin tone when i smoothed it on and it looked good and i could barely see it i really like that the stick is wide and thick , so you can you use it on big areas it was easy to adjust the height and it goes down easily i bruise easily , so i rubbed this over the smaller one , smoothed it , and i could barely see it i also tried it on the bigger one , i had to use a lot more
4	i love eye shadow , but i tend to prefer a more natural look when this pixelated color eye shadow palette arrived , i was a little concerned the pro basics shades seemed great , but the pixelated colors all looked a bit too garish in person for my taste however , with some blending and using the pixelated color as more of an accent to the pro basics , the overall effect was quite nice ive only been brave enough to try the copper shade of pixelated color , but i think the two shades of gray could also work well im not sure ill ever be brave enough to try the shades of purple im in forties , so im fairly certain sparkly purple eye shadow would look ridiculous on me and not at all flattering the quality of this eye shadow is very nice it goes exactly where you want it to go without any flaking off to unwanted spaces
5	i loved everything about it , sadly it needs to go back because the barrel is too wide for my short thin hair i own a 1 inch and wanted bigger curls , but my hair is to thin and too short great great iron the best my hair stylist only uses this one in the most expensive salon in boston
5	i style my hair exclusively by curling since it 's long , course , and quite crazy i have several different hot tools curling irons in different barrel sizes i received the t3 micro twirl convertible curling iron with interchangeable clip barrel \( 1 25 inch barrel \) and was fascinated in the idea of having barrels \( i would n't mind having one tool with several different barrels \) my husband had to connect it for me since i was having difficulties and did n't want to break it it heats up fast and you can control the range in temperature i set it to the second hottest range and works well for my thick course hair it comes with a protective hot pad for your counter but you have to be careful with your fingers since the tip still gets pretty hot this curling iron is quite amazing and have n't gone back to my hot tool irons since getting this one a few weeks ago if you want to get a great product and are n't concerned with the price then get this curling iron and it 's accompanying pieces if you are looking for a budget curling iron then i recommend hot tools
4	besides the fact that it 's a bit expensive for my tastes \( it is only two ounces , after all \) , i liked this hair remover unlike most removers out there \( and , trust me , i 've tried a lot of them \) , it was n't smelly and did n't need nearly as much product per patch to take off the hair it does exfoliate the top layer of skin , so be sure not to leave it on too much longer than the recommended amount of time bliss products expensive but worth it !
5	i absolutely love how this feels on my cleansed skin ! even though it says it 's an am day cream , i prefer to use it at night i use two pumps over my entire face and neck , smoothing it into my skin for a minute until it totally absorbs my skin feels wonderfully smooth i really think the product has improved the texture of my skin i also really like the delivery system of this cream it 's measured , prevents oxidizing , and is sanitary and thankfully it does n't contain any parabens , it is pricey , but i expect it to last quite a long time i hope to try the tinted mineral sunscreen next
5	love this
1	do not like this at all worst makeup spray i 've tried and it could all be fixed by making it an aerosol the problem is it 's too liquidy it leaked all over the lid and when i pulled the lid off , this stuff went everywhere so there 's shipping issues they need to fix and then i went to spray it on my face , following the instructions , 8 inches away , and it shot giant blobs of liquid all over my face that does n't help my makeup it ruins it i 've tried a makeup spray before and it was an aerosol and sprayed over my face thinly and evenly this does not
5	the scent of this l'occitane oil is worth it alone it 's absolutely delightful ! the oil is not too oily and spreads and soaks in fairly quickly this is definitely not a gross , heavy oil that some products provide the bottle and label are attractive , the price not so much , but that 's l'occitane for you , right \? this is a luxury item and if you 're searching for a gift or luxury product for yourself and you like being massaged then i can not find a reason not to recommend this one l'occitane is a brand i 've never felt able to afford and have never experienced , but the experience with this product has me i want to try more l'occitane now , and honestly , when this one runs out , it will be hard to not rush out and buy a new bottle i might just do that
5	love it
4	i am not giving it 5 stars since the smell fades away after about 4 5 hours i like a cologne where the smell stays on for a long time that 's just my opinion i wish this smell lasted a long time but ill keep the bottle i like colognes like obsession but want a smell that attracts if anyone can recommend a nice men 's cologne , please let me know by leaving a comment i was not to thrilled with the shipment i am a prime member and i should have received it in 2 days but got it a week later i know the weather had something to do with it with the snow we had in but i feel i should have received it sooner it was packed very well
5	i was called beautiful 3 times today running my errands \) this is definitely a must have ! it gave me a beautiful summer glow and is so silky yay
5	this is a wonderful cream it is n't a miracle in a little glass bottle , but it makes my skin soft , and it feels very soothing when i apply it it works wonders as a moisturizer it has reduced some fine lines , and there is a slight fullness to my skin that was n't present before i generally have sensitive skin , but this cream caused no problems for me if anything , it 's helped clear up some problem areas also , a very small amount goes a very long way when you consider how much use you get out of it \( mine is going on 3 months , still over half full \) the price point is n't quite as ridiculous , especially considering how good of a cream it actually is definitely recommended
5	i have medium length , thick , color treated hair and love the feel the chi silk infusion gives it just use a very sparing amount my hair feels soft and silky after use this has a very pleasant scent and a little goes a long way i'm quite pleased with the results
4	pretty color great for summer on toes i love essie polish it wears well and a long time
5	pleased with purchase
1	i bought 2 of these and i'm very disappointed these cost the full price of an essie polish so i expected it to be authentic these are watered down fakes i wish amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff \(
5	lovely scent
2	i love la roche posey products , but this just does n't meet my expectations first of all , it burns really bad , but also causes me to breakout and i have n't had breakouts in years i do not have sensitive skin and am used to glycolic acid peels , but for some reason i am sensitive to something in this formula this is a hard pass for me
4	edited to add i wanted to note that this deodorant still works well for me but i did notice some odor today after a long day at work we 'd had spicy food the night before , so that might have contributed a bit original notes i normally wear inexpensive deodorants that are heavy on the fragrance i could buy several of them for the cost of a single stick of this solid variety from vichy that said , i am so impressed by the effectiveness of this variety ! it goes on super smooth in terms of size it 's already smaller than grocery store brands , and when i apply it , it actually feels like it 's depositing something under my arms somehow it 's satisfying and that you can feel it going on with the cheap stuff , i feel about swiping on multiple times in a large area for more coverage with the vichy stick it goes on easily and i do n't feel the need to cover the area over and over again i live in so the days are already to the high 80 's most days having a good deodorant is i'm accustomed to that meaning an overly scented stick that might need to be re applied mid day this stick has no fragrance that i can detect after a normal day with little , i still smell fresh as a daisy but after a lengthy house cleaning session and working up a considerable sweat , i am even happier to note that i still smell clean and neutral there 's no and there 's no overly cloying floral fragrance lingering trying to mask my natural smell i'm impressed and already planning to buy more
5	moisturizer works great i have oily skin so i am careful about the kind of moisturizers i use but i wanted to give this one a try and i am glad i did it leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated but not oily and slick like many other moisturizers have done in the past i also really like the nice light smell of this moisturizer i do n't like things that have a harsh smell and this one is pleasant and makes me want to use it more over all a great moisturizer for oily skin and i really like it
4	this is a nice serum that goes on nicely without feeling oily or greasy one pump a day is all you need for good coverage there is a light odor but it is not unpleasant and it fades quickly the bottle attractive and the swirl adds some visual appeal as well the product instructions printed on the bottle are very small and light purple colored , making them very , very hard to read without a magnifying glass i ca n't really tell if the product is doing much that it advertises or not either , but i'm going to give it more time to see regardless , it certainly ca n't hurt to give it a try to see if it works for you
5	this is an excellent daily cleanser for my sensitive , rash and prone skin i 've used it for a while and am thrilled to have more in reserve it does exactly what i need it to do cleans my face with no residue , irritation or dryness its just the right balance for me of protection and cleaning this also works very well with my clarisonic cleaning system i carry it in my gym bag and prefer it to other face washes it takes me a while to have confidence in facial products and this has proven to be the best for my skin
5	i 've been using this to add a little shine to my hair and to help protect against heat damage , and it 's been working great love that it does both without making my hair look , unlike some other products , or weighing it down
5	i get dry , red , itchy irritated skin on occasion and have used products from gold bond and aveeno in the past for relief comparatively , i have to say that cicaplast b5 lotion is as good or better it works wonders on mild eczema and itchy red rashes relief is almost instantaneous and conditions clear up quickly the slight amount of zinc and combination of some other ingredients in the lotion also helps reduce the appearance of redness , though it can be fully rubbed into the skin if desired cicaplast is non greasy , odorless , non irritating , and is healthy for the skin all advantages in my opinion it does n't just cover up symptoms , it treats them i will be getting more of this wonderful product from la roche posay if needed kort
4	a little of this product goes a long way the benefits are that it works for fine hair and dark hair and does not show up as white particles like some dry shampoos however , it is not really a dry shampoo its a product that brings a little volume back into hair that has been flattened due to oil build up by the 2nd or 3rd day after a shampoo like others have said it does not reduce all over oil build up but adds volume to roots and gives the hair a lift use very little , and massage into roots and then wipe off hands on the frizzy ends as suggested
5	plumps lips nicely wish it stayed on longer
3	i got this for my husband because he likes to keep his facial hair well groomed maybe i influence that a bit he much prefers electric \( read faster \) trimmers than these manual kinds not always a pleasant experience to have nose or ear hair pulled if you ca n't clip fast enough , and that 's why electric versions win this set comes nicely packaged and seems to be well made the included tool brush and storage boxes are nice touches if you prefer manual ones , i'm sure this will suit your needs but it 's not a good method , in our honest opinion
5	having used a clarisonic for years i admit i have used off brand brushes as well as clarisonic brand brushes and the difference is clear the clarisonic brushes are much softer as i allow the brush to run over my skin i remind myself to let the machine do the work and not press too hard since using this official brush i have experienced no negative skin reaction and less redness i recommendations to brand cleaning heads ,
3	i have not had much luck recently with commercial fragrances , as they all tend to smell the same with my body chemistry , sort of chemical like and cheap since i tend to gravitate toward woodsy or floral type scents , i thought maybe a fragrance that claims to have a more fruit based scent \( asian pear in this case \) would be different i was wrong josie smells fine in the bottle , but when i apply to myself , i first get a strong alcohol smell like i had spilled rubbing alcohol in the room then the alcohol smell goes away , and i am left with a scent that is hard to describe it is not asian pear , nor is it citrus , but more of a can of tropical fruit salad smell this fades quickly and is followed by a floral scent , like freesia and hyacinth mixed with ivory soap on my skin , it smells absolutely nothing like the matching body lotion did which is a good thing not a terrible scent , and it did not give me a headache like reveal by calvin klein , but it is not for me it does smell better on my clothing , , and as an air freshener than it does on me it does not even smell nice on my daughter , on whom the body lotion smells wonderful guess i will have to stick with perfume oils
1	smelled funny had a sticky residue too pricey i prefer replenix products over this
5	flexible use on combination skin as i 've matured , i do pay closer attention to my skin and it 's needs i 've started doing the give it what it needs skin treatments i like this moisturizing serum and the flexibility it offers its effective with just the serum on my oily t zone , while my dry cheeks get a moisturizer with a serum topper when the t zone needs no help at all it gets nothing , while my cheeks get the usual moisturizer serum treatment the all or nothing method all over my face , neck and chest i 've done for years was n't working to benefit each areas needs ca n't believe it took me so long to figure it all out
4	the 1st complaint i have is the smell it reminds me of something musty and old but i do love the consistency and the texture my skin feels smooth and moisturized it also helps my foundation last longer like a primer always a plus i do n't see any improvement on wrinkles as of yet but will update later my 2nd complaint is the price seriously almost 100 dollars \? luckily i received this for my honest opinion but i would never go out of my way to purchase this
5	exc purchase
5	wow , that smells good ! the nice smell of this should not be overlooked i have never used a hair removal cream that worked and smelled good this was really easy it has a built in applicator i had to smooth out a couple of places but it went on almost perfectly i wiped it off at 4 minutes and all the hair came off easily and i have to say this beats the hell out of a wax job you can get hurt from those ! i am becoming a fan of bliss products they may not do everything they anyone \? but they smell good and are made with quality ingredients and there is a little in claiming to take away cellulite the directions say to put that cream on your thighs and do 10 deep lol i like the bliss style , anyway
5	great color
5	i love essie for the quality and colors and i love that amazon often has a good price pleased with my polish
4	i have very sensitive eyes most mascaras end up under my eye because i find myself rubbing my eyes during the day because f allergies it was n't until recently that i figured out i was actually having a reaction to the mascara this mascara did not bother my eyes at all i did not end up with black under eyes from rubbing the mascara did not flake , and did not irritate my skin it gives an attractive natural look i'm hoping they make this in a fuller look too
5	l'occitane lavender liquid soap is of superb quality , very thick and rich with the scent of true french lavender \( lavandula \) it makes a nice creamy lather and does not dry your skin the bottle and pump are quite sturdy it makes an excellent , slightly luxurious gift \( or self indulgent treat ! \) for anyone who enjoys lavender very highly recommended
5	this product has a light cream texture , does n't have any smell , and absorbed super fast as the instructions suggest to use a small amount first , it really was enough for my face one and a half pea size drops it absorbed super fast and leaves no residues , but just a matte feeling i was able to put make up on right away this was the first chemical peeling product i have used , so i can not compare it with other similar products , but i can say that this one does the job for my skin i found it best to use it couple times a week , every day seemed too much and made my skin feel uncomfortable , but this might also be from the fact that i am using acne treatments \( from this same brand \) at the same time which also dries my skin a bit so for my situation , having acne , i could still use this product and improve the spots left by acne as far as sun sensitivity , yes you should take this warning seriously use sunscreen on top , or choose the time of the year when try this product with minimal sun exposure , according to where you live it will make your face burn if you are going out in the sun this product together with my obagi acne treatment has helped my skin look better for sure the skin tone is more even , feels cleaner and seems tighter too i have nothing bad to say except to follow the precautions when using this type of product i am very eager to try other obagi products my experience has been very positive
3	i bought the 5 day detox kit so i could try a lot of the skyn iceland products this is an all right moisturizer for nighttime if you do not have dry skin it has no spf , so it 's not really appropriate for day wear it has a quick cooling effect i'm not sure this is actually doing anything for the skin , but it feels nice i have been using this as a sort of serum under a richer cream before bed have n't seen any changes to my skin using these products so if you have dry skin , this lotion may be one to avoid , especially at this price
3	i have been using a shiseido eyelash curler for many years and have had no problem replacing the pads which are readily available i wipe the pad down after using and i do n't use the curler after applying mascara , so it is still perfectly and looks good after a very long time the eyelash curler by georgie beauty resembles the shiseido and numerous varieties but it has something special in the certified organic blue chamomile enhancement to the pads it is sold with the enclosed pad and an additional two replacements i 've been unable to locate the pads for purchase at this time , but being that the tool is now sold at major higher end department stores , i'm sure they will be available in the near future this curler works no better than the shiseido or any other i 've used i am not impressed by a pad with chamomile because i do n't think it will last longer than the initial use for a person such as myself who cleans the tools they use on their eyes yes , it is nice to include a couple of replacement pads , but to me , they are no better than others and since the curler costs about as much as my previous tool , i still prefer my long time friend eyelash curler
5	no complaints
5	whoa ! i love it ! nicely ! very cleansing scalp and hair feels great after using this i follow it with philip b 's light weight conditioner love the conditioner too !
5	color me quite surprised by the lightness of this product compared to the amount of coverage at first i thought it would be like a tinted mositurizer or bb cream because it feels that light \( if not even lighter \) but it goes on flawlessly and it covers like a foundation one layer is completely do able but two will be perfect for all day fave coverage i need to work on the color a bit , this was a shade darker than i imagined
3	i like citrus fragrances i like white flowers so this should be a scent i adore i like it fine but the mango dried fruits make it a bit too fruity for me this is not over the top fruit , the jasmine neroli keep it in check but i'm really over the frooty tooty scents this one is not fake and cloying but just not my taste anymore if you like fruit scents but not too sweet , you may like this one this starts out with blood orange a nice fresh not too sweet blood orange but then the mango comes on a little stronger it 's not too sweet , it has a bit of pepper note but i just do n't care for it the mango ruins this for me luckily , bergamot jasmine save the day , bringing a lemony , fresh flower note this is not the lush jasmine of scents but a fresh light jasmine underneath it all but not too heavy , is the musk powdery note of orris it is not a dirty musk but more of a white musk the sillage is not huge it lasts about 3 hours on my skin it is a well made and inoffensive generic fragrance much better than many other fragrances of this type i prefer the rochas fragrance tocade it 's more serious adult or if you like a more light fresh eau de rochas , the fraiche version has no sweet fruits a bit of rochas is now owned by gamble \( \)
3	i give the pillow 3 stars for now because i'm not sure about the antiaging properties i do wake up though with no creases on my face that might be due to fabric though
4	baxters has become my new favorite line of products after being an american crew and redken guy for the last 10 years normally i buy the hard water pomade but i'm actually really liking this clay the clay has a different smell , a bit more or herbal smelling , and is n't really good at going on dry if you have fine hair but if you add i few drops of water and warm it up it goes on easy and has great hold the lotion is awesome , hardly any fragrance , and leaves my face feeling good all day not too greasy or anything either the deodorant is the only part of this kit i do n't like , and only because of the smell it 's not a feminine smell at all which is good , it 's more of a natural herbal kinda smell , but it 's really strong really , do n't bother wearing cologne with this stuff but beyond the it did a great job of keeping me from stinking and unlike a lot of other deodorants it did n't give me a rash apparently i have sensitive armpits and most stuff makes me break out wore this 3 days in a row and had no issues so if you like the smell \( which i do \) and do n't mind how strong it is \( which i do \) then this is a great deodorant overall i 'd say it would make a nice gift for a guy looking to step up from speed stick , suave hair gel and jergens quality products all around
3	i saw this in a salon i frequent but it was expensive i thought this was a good buy but i am not sure it was as strong as the one i saw in the salon could not find info on how strong it was
5	obagi is a hit with my wife and daughter love this cleanser ! ! ! you may think a cleanser is a cleanser , but this stands out it has a gel ish consistency with a mild aroma , and it cleans the skin well without drying out the skin there is no sudsing with this it doesnt foam or bubble , but skin is left clean and refreshed love this product ! ! ! wish it was n't so pricey , but its excellent
5	good
5	nice brownish color goes on smoothly
5	got this for my parents and they absolutely love it it 's the best lotion they 've ever used
4	this is a nice eye cream that does a good job hydrating the skin under your eyes you can feel it working a soft little tingle and a slightly cool sensation tell you that it 's doing something the dispenser actually dispenses a bit too much and it 's hard to get a smaller amount dispensed the pump is a little stiff and seems to dispense the same amount , regardless what gets dispensed is more than enough to cover my under eye area i use the around the outside of my mouth , the other area on me that has a host of those tiny little lines that are mostly just to be filled and moisturized the product does not have a discernable fragrance and is appropriate for use by men and women alike in terms of effectiveness , it does help to plump up those areas that have a little crepe or fine lines i 've used it every day for a little over a week and i would say that the results are fairly typical for this product type
5	fast shipping and great price ! this is a lovely summer color , not to pale and not too bright just perfect as with all of the vinylux it dries fast and wears a long time ! perfect !
4	good stuff
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
1	i love all coola products this however had the consistency of the correct product but felt like it had sand in it it felt like an exfoliating scrub i tried to use it as long as i could but my face was raw after a few days i will continue to buy my coola products directly from birchbox as to avoid wasting money
5	i love essie polishes essie products are very consistent in the quality it goes on smoothly and dries very fast
2	do n't know what was the hype about all over you tube , i get occasional break out and this product did not help i normally love mario product and currently addicted with cleansers and toners but drying lotion did n't was ok read my full review at
4	love essie but i am not thrilled about this color but too each his own
3	all you need is a pearl sized amount to cover your entire face in this primer it literally glides onto the skin , but i feel that my skin absorbs this base too quickly to effectively make a difference on the makeup that i put on top of it i assumed my makeup would glide onto my face after applying this , but it 's not the case one thing i can say is that i feel like my face seems less oily at the end of the day when i use it after the couple times i 've used it though , i 've found myself not going out of my way to apply this before the rest of my make up because i do n't see enough of a difference between using it and using nothing
3	i am in a constant search for the holy grail of a way to deal with the wrinkles under my eyes and i wear contact lenses so i do n't want something so strong that it bothers my eyes this cream definitely on the second point i have n't had any sensitivity at all from this cream so that is a plus but it has had little effect on the wrinkles under my eyes i 've been using it only on one eye so i can compare it to the other eye \( and i have n't been using anything on that eye so it is full wrinkle \) if i really look hard , i might see a little difference , but i doubt that anyone looking at me could tell this might be better for younger women whose wrinkles are not as deep as mine so far the best product i 've used has been nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href intensive under eye treatment net 0 5 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 intensive under eye treatment , net 0 5 oz a
4	this is a high quality compact manicure set that contains a finger nail clipper , slanted tweezers , nail scissors , cuticle pusher shaper and nail file i am very happy to have received this but it is ridiculously expensive , albeit very nice quality moreover , it does not have a cuticle trimmer i consider a trimmer essential am aware that it many advise against trimming the cuticles as they protect the nail bed from infection i do not trim very often but sometimes it is necessary a very sharp , small cuticle trimmer is essential for doing this with precision was very surprised that a set of this quality \( and price \) does not contain this essential implement much more important to me personally than a fingernail clipper because i never clip , only file my finger and toe nails the nail file is very effective , perhaps just a bit coarse \( will probably become finer with use \) so in addition to this set , you will need a finer grade board or file , a cuticle clipper , and perhaps a mail buffer because of the items it contains and does not contain , this set seems targeted more to male user than a female one i for one would have happily the clipper and the scissors for a cuticle trimmer
5	after seeing how good hair looked in american , i decided to give hot rollers another try this set is on the expensive end of the spectrum , but it 's great four of the rollers are jumbo and the other four are almost as big , which made my thick , curly hair quick to set the appliance heats up quickly , and i needed to keep the rollers in my hair for only a few minutes i'm happy with the result
5	this is my all time favorite facial moisturizer it is so light and smooth not sure why it 's called , since there 's no butter or milk in it , but , whatever i was bummed at the small bottle size until i started using it and realized i only need a very small amount each time so , it 's lasts a long time for such a small bottle fyi i have very fair , sensitive skin \( and very young looking 53 years old \)
3	i 've used a couple v76 by vaughn products and i really like their texture paste the molding paste has a little firmer hold , but the satin finish just makes my hair look a little too greasy unfortunately scent is identical to the texture paste if you have fine hair , the texture paste would be a better choice for you like their other offerings , this is a pretty high price point for 1 7 ounces
4	i admit that i was a little leery to try this because of the comment about a , but i think that 's just because this belongs to a line of products that do provide a tint and this is the final part that helps to set the makeup i do have a setting spray \( a primer and setting spray from smashbox , in fact \) and have used urban decay 's as well , so i have something to compare bliss' to , and i have to say , this aerosol spray is really nice in that once you spray it on your face , your face feels dry and your makeup is set and does n't appear wet at all there 's no or worry about the spray drying \( especially if you 're wearing glasses \) however , there is a scent , a chemical scent , that does linger for about an hour \( maybe less \) which while not too bad , i definitely notice that 's why it 's not five stars but it works , it sets the makeup and it looks good i'm used to the price considering the other sprays i 've bought just wish the scent was better \( or non existent \)
5	this stuff is effective ! i just love it i use it once or twice a week it makes my skin feel super smooth and silky on a deeper level careful if you have so much as a tiny cut it will sting in fact , i can not shave within 24 hours of using the stuff but it 's worth it believe me !
4	this is a mineral based product , but i wish it was water based it claims to keep skin moisturized for 2 days i do n't know about that claim , but time will tell once applied to the skin it dries very quickly use sparingly another u s reviewer noted that it improved the appearance of crepey skin another u s reviewer noted that this product contains xanthan gum which is sugar and carrageenan , neither of which you want in your body had i known that going in , i would not have ordered this as for use on the skin , good
3	the color is a fun , bright summer color neon without being ridiculous however , it was very thick and not smooth it was difficult to put on smoothly it also took three coats and dries matte i put a top coat on so its shiny anyway it 's ok , not great
5	my absolute favorite brand of lipstick
5	really nice nail file only downside is that it breaks if it falls from the countertop ! this is my 2nd file , first one broke when it hit the floor i liked it enough to reorder
2	ok to be clear i have to point out that the seller was great ! i received the product early and it was packaged securely the issue i have with this polish it that it never dries i love essie but the formula on this one is aweful the color is gorgeous but it goes on pretty sheer so it takes 3 coats just to get to what you see in the bottle but even with one coat \( i tried it out just to see if it 'd dry that way \) it 'll smudge as soon as you touch anything the better buy would be sinful colors endless blue ! ! the colors are identical and the formula 's great !
5	this product came on time and was in perfect condition this color is great and can be worn any time of the year !
4	1 25 2018 i am starting to use this 2 24 2018 i am still using this i keep it by my computer and this way i am more consistent with its usage it smells great like a sugar i paint it onto the left hand and rub my nails together spreading it to the right hand a little goes a long way i am a nail bitter and this gives me not to bite them if only i could lay off my thumbs \)
4	compared to over the counter products that come with 1 benzoyl peroxide , the obagi comes with 5 benzoyl peroxide i used the product on a blemish and it cleared up the area in much shorter time than over the counter products my skin did not try out and it did not become irritated the product also did not leave a white residue on my skin i did n't have to use a lot of the product to obtain the results i did the main issue with the product is the price at the current price that is charged on amazon it is very expensive and may be out of financial reach of many while it may be worth a try to see if the performance is worth the price for your situation , over a long period of use the price needs to come down for many people to purchase the product
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
4	my skin is often dry often moisturize twice daily when i'm out side a lot i slather myself often and i have a number of favorite lotions that work well the crepe erase ultra hydrating body lotion is quite good and i had no set expectations the very first thing i noticed was a pleasant scent , stronger than most other lotions i use , but not too much i do tend to like a scent to my lotions it applied very nicely , a cream thickness to it , not watery or runny it absorbs well and hydrates my skin nicely it 's pricey for a lotion , but good for what you get i'm in the sun a lot and this makes a difference in the appearance of my skin , which is well hydrated skin a little does go a long way and while i like it a lot , i pay the same for a coconut and cocoa butter based lotion that is for the same money do n't get me wrong , it 's certainly good but maybe i'm not firmly enough in the target market for this product
5	i really like bioderma 's atoderm cream it 's hypoallergenic , lasts a long time , and best of all is fragrance free a little goes a very long way , too , making this cream a bargain the cream moisturizes very well and has a thick , luxurious feeling without greasiness my husband is prone to dry skin problems cracking and itching particularly on his hands , and this product not only soothes it heals , too i like using it on my arms and legs after showering makes my skin feel silky and young again we will be sticking with this product i'm so glad we tried it !
4	for men , but can be used by women expensive but just a very little goes a long way lightly scented by not at all offensive or over powering the consistency is more between a cream and a lotion goes on nice , relieves dryness not really so sure about the making your wrinkles disappear just through it 's nature of relieving dry skin , it may well plump up the wrinkle zones , but as for making them go away maybe not
5	i did not see fibers this is more like a colored , powdered hair shampoo that does add body , and does not leave white residue like a dry shampoo that said , i like this product i have fine , thin curly hair that will droop if i use heavy products i have tried a lot of body building hair products , and many are just too weighty even frizz is not great for me so far , this is a winner
5	great
3	i was looking forward to trying the vichy peel mask after working with it i ca n't say i see any difference in my skin but i will give it time and if things change update this review pros 1 product is an attractive whipped peach color 2 product glides easily on face 3 skin felt soft after using cons 1 the cardboard box the product comes in is to thin for it my product came out of the box during shipping 2 directions are only on box not on product 3 product is not fragrance free hello , when will manufacturers get that many people do not want to add unnecessary irritants to their face 3 product is sticky to wash off from the skin if you have not rolled it off with your fingertips prior to washing 4 you dip fingers directly in jar which is not hygienic no scoop or other device is included 5 no noticeable glow or tighter pores time will tell if this product does any better
5	this product is exactly as advertised arrived promptly thank you
4	i love this stuff it gets my skin very clean and yet my skin stays very soft i am loving vichy face products like crazy good good stuff my face looks amazing i am 45 and look 30 i'm both lucky and use the right products
5	the smell alone is worth the purchase ! my husband has short hair so he 's not too picky on his hairspray he usually just buys cheap store brands so this was a welcome treat great hold !
4	great body concealer i took a picture of it covering some freckles on my arm only two applications and they barely visible would be great to cover tattoos for pictures or i would recommend large areas because it does have a thick texture to it my stick did come broken and stuck up in the cap but i was able to get it out and still use it i would n't be happy of i had paid full price and this came broken looks like i am not the only one who received a broken one either so thats an issue they need to address
4	i had never tried this moisturizer or brand before and was interested to see how i would like it it 's a very simple moisturizer and does the job well it 's not sticky or greasy feeling and it does a good job making my face feel hydrated the scent is a strong orange one , which some people might not like a lot i wore clinique happy for years with it 's orange scent , so this smell does n't bother me at all my skin is n't sensitive , so i ca n't point to whether it works better for those with sensitive areas , but i did feel that dry areas were taken care of and oily areas were n't over moisturized after trying this , i would certainly consider other products in the line give it a try nice , simply , no frills or promises other than to keep your skin hydrated and feeling soothed
5	i have seen many polishes but this one is truly at the top the silver is gorgeous and if you look closely you will see little metallic silver stars i mix this polish with some fine crystals to give it even more sparkle but it stands beautifully on it 's own i know you will never get a more beautiful silver \( w a pinch of white \) than this and you will definitely not be disappointed !
5	beautiful lavender colour
5	the best eyeliner thus far
5	for one month , my wife has diligently used juice green apple nutrient eye cream her comments have consistently been 1 good , light scent 2 goes on lightly , much like rosewater 3 feel the difference , with moisturized skin , but no greasy feeling after a month of daily use , some of the fine wrinkles have actually gone away from the corners of my wife 's eyes despite a very month with much even though the price of the cream is high , it seems like we have at least a few more month 's worth of use in the bottle see the attached pictures for our before and after
5	wife loved it her straight talk review it goes on easily no smell to compete with perfume or to irritate your skin it gave her a nice glow her coworkers loved the glow
5	seems like a great product so far we 'll see
4	this does not my rosacea prone skin it does feel like washing your face with conditioner i almost wonder if it 's cleansing my face at all , but i appreciate that it does n't irritate !
3	this color is not as vibrant as expected from online photos please note
3	i notice some benefit from using strivectin advanced retinol eye cream , but nothing dramatic it makes the skin around my eyes feels firmer , smoother and softer im in my 50s but do n't yet have crows feet , puffiness or bags , so i cant say if this eye cream helps those concerns i do have fine lines that i think looked better while using strivectin intensive eye concentrate , but i did n't notice improvement with strivectin ar dark circles are my worst issue and most products really do n't help including this one i did n't experience any real irritation , but i also do n't find this cream comforting its lightweight and did n't cause issues with my makeup application i used strivectin ar about 10 days but stopped as my dark circles were more noticeable , and i was concerned by a high risk 9 rating on the ewg site among other things , this cream has bha , bht and retinol while retinol can produce positive results with time , the risks \( including cancer \) concern me i was n't really aware of the and possible risks until after i started using strivectin ar , and i decided i do n't see enough improvement to continue use at this time \( but do n't know how long it takes to achieve optimal benefits \) perhaps id try this product down the road again \( used only at night \) as aging takes more of a toll , but for my current issues i got better results using strivectin intensive eye concentrate 3 5 stars made in the usa
3	works ok but does leave your hair feeling a little crunchy and stiff you can also notice a sticky feeling as well after use it states you will have neither but you have both it does work as a gel though the smell is fruity smelling and i really liked it
4	more use options at lower price this foreo luna mini competes effectively , it on costs and use options and pricing in these ways 1 2 sided silicone fingers are like two brush heads in one , delicate and stronger deeper changing sides not brushes 2 silicone is anti bacterial compared to other brush heads , 3 no brush head replacement needed every 3 months , 4 i can use this for cleansing , toning , moisturizing by simply rinsing the brush between the steps not my clarisonic 5 charge lasts months 6 usb charger cord only , i did n't receive replacement battery 7 various online stores have , sales and or value packages that are less pricey than my initial clarisonic , purchase , replacement brushes etc similar to clarisonic 1 built in timer signal to move to other parts of face 2 2 speeds that change at the touch of a button 3 fakes are out there , be sure to register your foreo promptly just in case ! i 've used this 2 times a day for cleansing and moisturizing since i 've gotten it my skin is looking better because it helps cleanse and special moisturizer treatment creams for mature skin penetrate better with the sonic massage !
1	i loved the color of this nail polish when i first bought it however , after applying two coats it was a disastrous mess the ending result was thick , streaky and looked as if i applied 5 coats when dried it was so unattractive , it had to be removed straight away not worth 14 00 !
5	i 've used this foaming cleanser several times , and can notice the difference in my skin almost immediately my skin feels so much softer and a little more glowing it leaves a nice clean feeling on my skin that no other soap can give i usually use other brand bar soaps , that i thought were great , and left my skin feeling clean , but this really makes my skin feel clean and refreshed i highly recommend this foam cleanser
5	love , love , love this color ! essie is always great ! the bottle was actually a little bigger than i expected i got a lot of nail polish for my money will be buying essie products again and again !
5	nice top coat for a smooth shiny finish seems to last well i got it a little on amazon then at the department store
5	my wife used these patches to address a few wrinkles around the forehead and mouth the gel patches were a departure for my wife , who typically uses a cream or serum as she described , the patches were applied for 10 minutes and felt cool on the skin there was also a slight tingling sensation nothing too horrific though even when left on for longer than the suggested 10 minute application time overall , she found that the patches firmed her skin up and was very pleased with this product
5	this polish is awesome it does not chip or crack , and the color stays on for a long time i have purchased more colors !
5	on my second jar of this ! it 's not too heavy like a lot of night creams are and rubs in smoothly without leaving my skin feeling greasy
4	i love the purple color it 's not in your face purple , but almost a little more pink and soft looking the one thing that i'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen it 's not really matte and not shiny i have n't decided how i feel about that
5	always loved this formula and the shampoo the other products do not smell the same and do not work as well for me i wish i could find this formula in the shampoo , conditioner , and leave treatment at my local stores , but no one seems to carry it anymore definitely the best products are these original ones
3	lovely color , hydrating and nice feel , but the fragrance was very unappealing reminded me of an old product my mom used for years and years could n't get past the scent of the product to continue wearing it color was n't the best shade for my lighter tones either \( reviewed by my wife \)
4	great for the in between days , scent is amazing !
5	really simple and pretty with a top coat
3	i tried the face wash and could n't go any further it dried my face out , and it 's not even winter yet this is a face wash i 'll save for when i have breakouts only not for daily use i can see it doing more harm than good like other reviewers i do n't have sensitive skin , just normal with a sometimes oily t zone but this is much to harsh on my skin for any time other than when i have a breakout
5	essie cartel blue is a deep , rich navy blue it 's perfect for any time of the year
4	i 've been using the nuface trinity trainer wrinkle reducer for three weeks and i have seen improvement in my skin 's elasticity , texture , and overall youthfulness the device is easy to use and comes with the trinity trainer , wrinkle reducer \( attachment \) , charging base primer gel immediately upon opening the box i plugged the device up to charge \( it 's suggested to charge for 12 hours \) and read the instructions i was impressed with the detailed instructions i recommend watching the videos on nuface 's website , as well as , youtube the before after pictures are quite dramatic and the customer comments on the nuface facebook page suggest people are very pleased with this device my experience thus far i would rate as better than average it has n't been the instant , omg what did you do \? it 's been subtle changes over the last three weeks that are n't so readily noticeable by people that see me everyday however , my cousin \( i have n't seen in about a year \) noticed immediately ! she said my face looked rejuvenated and had a glow which encouraged me to continue using nuface if you are going to invest the money in this product , you have to invest the time to use it properly everyone is different , but this has been my daily nuface regiment wash face thoroughly , making sure all make up is removed , dry completely apply primer gel in first area to be treated i always begin with my right , lower jawline starting at the , i slowly sweep across my face , to the nose \( repeating this 3 times , as instructed \) if the gel starts to dry , i dab a drop of water on my finger tip , then gently swirl on my face , til the gel feels refreshed i continue up the side of my face , in sections the width of the device \( applying gel to each section as i go \) right side complete , i move to the left , lower jawline and repeat the exact same steps , moving or repeating a section when the device beeps i then sweep my forehead and neck area \( always in sections the width of the device \) lastly , i switch to the wrinkle reducer \( slowly moving the device over my forehead , under eye to corner , face folds \( aka laugh lines \) then under chin \( neck area \) treatment complete , i clean the attachments with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol then return it to the charging cradle i then apply my face cream from start to finish about all of this sounds like a long drawn out process , but honestly it only takes about 22 and considering this can be done while sitting on the watching television it 's really not a long time it certainly does n't seem like too much when you get results of course we all like things to be fast and painless , but anything worth having is worth investing the time to get that 's the big thing with this device , you have to do it everyday , because results are cumulative although there was nothing in the literature about acne , i did notice a substantial improvement in that area the unit itself is chunky and heavy , very well constructed however , if you have small hands , like me , it gets uncomfortable after prolonged use simply resting a minute or so and you 're ready to go i mention it only to be thorough turning it on , adjusting the strength of the current and switching attachments is easy the dial on the front lights up blue when turned on , and with each click to increase or decrease , there 's an beep similar to that the device makes when you are using it , indicating it is time to move to the next section there is a one year warranty , but you must register your device in order to activate it my main complaint with this kit , is what it lacks i think all the face attachments should be included i mean , would n't most people want to treat their entire face and to begin the treatment of all areas at the same time that 's why i think the eye and lip attachments should be included with the face trainer kit hopefully , there will be others to voice this opinion and the company will offer a complete kit for the whole face in a nut shell keeping in mind i 've only used this product for less than 30 days and the suggested time is 60 days if you are looking for a quick fix and fast , dramatic improvements , it would be best to call a plastic surgeon if however , you are willing to dedicate yourself to using this device daily and have reasonable expectations , by all means , buy it ! if your results are like mine , you will be glad you did ! https be link to helpful youtube video
2	no good for medium skin color makes face look dirty does not help when contouring
3	the women in the family report that they do not particularly like the feel of the gel cream as it gets applied as far as moisturizing goes , it appears to do the job
5	great color my girl friend loves it
1	the blue box is stunning , each item was individually wrapped in tissue paper as i began opening up each bottle i was over taken by the strong perfume smell it smelled like old lady powered i do n't understand why companies have to add such harsh perfumes and smells to their products there are customers who have sensitive skin and sensitive to smells that would like to be able to use their products it is really disappointing that i was unable again to use a product due to the horrible fragrance choice
4	this japonesque kumadori fan brush is perfect for apply loose powder it applies it evenly and helps to cover your face in an efficient way it 's a little bigger than i was expecting but i m enjoying it
4	i 've tried most of the mascara brands at sephora , plus several from the drugstore and department stores \( 30 years of mascara and counting \) the best i 've found that works for me is nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href benefit they re real mascara dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 benefit they 're real mascara a , for the lengthening and volumizing of my lashes , plus no flaking smudging clumping and relative ease of removal this mascara compares well , with a couple of caveats pros lengthens well with one coat does n't smudge or flake on me removes easily with cleanser and water , no harsh rubbing required easy to get color down to the base of lashes \( some fuller brushes make this harder and or messier \) does n't irritate my eyes at all cons does n't add volume if you 're looking for fuller lashes \( not just longer \) , this may not be the right mascara the bristles are really short , so application gets most of the color on the front of the lashes \( plus the backs if i bother with that side \) the sides of the lashes get almost nothing \( see photo comparing this wand with benefit 's wand \) it clumps on me i guess because of the super short bristles , the applicator ends up clumping color at times , even with just one coat i wish it separated lashes better overall , this is a good mascara for length , not so good for fullness \( unless you count clumps ! \)
5	i used the toppik hair fibers for a week before using the fiberhold spray while i liked the hair fibers a lot and was happy with the product the fiberhold spray definitely holds my hair in place and helped attach the fibers to my natural hair without using the spray the hair fibers looked a little fuzzy or light dust was a little on my head with the fiberhold spray the fibers darken a little and thicken my hair my hair does not feel stiff and does not attract dirt i use the fiberhold spray every day now and it does n't add any build up of product either i recommend it !
5	came fast and is really pretty
4	this is a big , hefty bar of soap it has a nice , fresh smell though this is supposedly a men 's product , i did not find the scent to be overly masculine , and i 'd describe it as more unisex in the shower it created a nice lather and felt good on my skin this is definitely a pricey bar of soap , and while i 'd certainly say it 's a step up from your average supermarket brand , it is certainly possible to get nice soap for a fraction of the price
1	the mask feels slightly tacky and i did n't notice any real difference in my skin after i was scared i would break out but did n't i would n't recommend the mask , although i usually love this brand
5	i love this product ! ! ! it cleanses with no greasy residue after and it is very gentle it work wonders on dry skin !
5	i'm pleased by this yes , some people have complained about the packaging which i happen to like small sizes can be tough to handle which is n't a problem with this although if you are traveling , this is n't the right choice next is the results i'm past the half century mark and live in florida where the heat and humidity are routinely in the 90 to 100 range \( for both \) it takes a toll on skin add in some inevitable sun damage and it 's a recipe for fine lines \( and not so fine lines \) this will do nothing for those deep smile lines which are beyond the reach of most superficial solutions what it will help with is the fine lines like those around the eyes although more or less a toxic of chemicals which i typically prefer to avoid , this contains several key ingredients and did not irritate my skin whatsoever
4	excellent sunscreen i rarely reapply more than once a day , and as of yet , it still seems to help a great deal it 's light weight and does n't leave a greasy residue the only sticking point is the price , because for the same type of product there are many other sunscreens available that are cheaper
4	this body wash is just as its name says , creamy unfortunately , it is too creamy for my taste it does not lather that easily under running shower and tends to form creamy lumps rather than smooth lather perhaps one needs to spread a think layer over an area and then use water , but this is not the way i shower it smells very nicely with a prevalent grapefruit scent i have used for years gillette hydrator , which lathers perfectly under running water , but it has a somewhat strong unnatural scent if gillette only could make it smell like this body wash , then we 'd have a perfect hydrating wash sigh \)
5	as with other dermablend covers that i have tried , a very , very little of the product goes a very , very long way the instructions recommend that you put a spot of it on the back of your hand and work the product to warm and loosen it i think this is very good advice as the product really sticks to the first spot you put it on \( including the back of your hand \) the cover is 100 and still let 's your skin look like skin it is also water proof , sweat proof and practically soap proof it 's really hard to get it off of skin \( especially the back of your hand \) both the reddish tan and toasted brown can be used as a dark contour , even if your skin is pretty dark i love how the reddish tan looks like dark suntan there is no scent and i have n't had any breakouts or skin sensitivity , although i tend to have pretty tough skin and do n't usually have any problems
5	bioderma shower oil is a thick oil that distributes easily over the body it produces a small lather when applied with hands a little bit of the oil goes a long way and it replenishes my skin i enjoy the floral type of scent and it reminds me of spring , lilacs , and tropical flowers it is not irritating to my skin and is noticeably hydrating it has a spa like feel and feels wonderful to use i have even used it on my face in the shower and i found it to be hydrating and protective it does n't leave my skin greasy and i cannot feel a residue i do not notice a shine on my skin and i still apply lotion after my shower i am very happy with bioderma atoderm shower oil and would order again it does what it says it will do and the scent is beautiful
5	i love this stuff i mean it has finally set me free from having to shower every morning let me stress that i have tried so many other dry shampoos and it did not help or made my hair feel gross i bought this the first time to give a try when i was traveling for almost my hair would get so oily and a little bit of this was all i needed i have dark hair and the powder is white so yes if you use a lot you can see it a little bit , however if you take a few min to work it in you cant see it anymore ! it is a little pricey but for me it is well worth it , i thought i would be able to go a day or 2 without washing my hair and looking disgusting and was so of all my friends who were able to do that but now i can ! saves me so much time in the morning not having to blow dry and style every day it 's a really light weight powder and almost has a bit of grit in the powder which makes my hair feel clean and while giving it lift in my opinion this is what makes it better then any other because it does more then soak up oil
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
3	i ordered this set because the description reminded me a bit of the old mary kay satin hands kit which of three products a cleanser , an exfoliant and a thick , emollient pink body butter gel i always enjoyed the temporary smoothing effect it had on my skin , particularly when used in conjunction with a pair of white cotton gloves and a good night 's rest although i tend to be leery of infomercial products and am not a fan of these multi step multi product systems , i did have good luck with the pro active line and trust guthy renker , so i thought i 'd give this set a try at 53 , i have yet to find crepe y areas on my legs or arms , but my neck and upper chest could use some work after a week of using this exclusively on those two areas , i 'd have to say the results are fairly first off , the scrub is very slippery and does n't seem to work as a mechanical exfoliant i do much better with my washcloth when i want to slough off dead skin however it does contain several acids \( including lactic and citric \) , so perhaps it works more on a chemical level \( in which case a week is probably not enough time to determine the results \) so overall , the scrub was a bust for me on the other hand , i really loved the cream it 's very rich and solid with an intensive moisturizing quality even after a night 's sleep , my chest and neck still felt moist and soft in the morning and there was slight improvement in the appearance of the skin on my neck but honestly , i think the effect is purely cosmetic after applying the cream , the skin has a youthful , smooth look which is very lasting because the cream itself has staying power , but i do n't think this product actually changes the skin on a cellular level still , it feels very luxurious going on and the light citrus scent is delightful i do n't know if that 's enough to justify the cost you decide
5	i love it !
3	this is a good quality product that will suit some better than others it tends toward the orange hues \( not but subtly in a way that warmer skin tones probably would n't notice but cool ones will \) the coverage is good , particularly good at concealing flaws and blemishes it does n't cake on wrinkles it takes a little practice to get a natural look
5	i am a fan of the jack black products and use them daily this sunscreen is of how exceptional their products are the creme easily rubs into the skin leaving no greasy residue especially impressive is that when doing physical activities \( cycling in my case \) the sunscreen does not run or sting the eyes this is a superior product and recommended without reservations
4	this makeup covers well and goes on smoothly the only negative , to me , is that you need powder to look matte it is n't as natural looking as my favorite brand , la roche posay effaclar bb blur instant oil absorbing coverage bb cream it does cover better though depending on what you need to cover , this makeup works great i will use it more in the winter than summer
4	jouer is not a cosmetic brand i am very familiar with however , i liked the shade of this lip treatment and its botanical ingredients although it is much easier to choose lip gloss colors in person , the provided images are a very close match to what youll get yet this is n't just lip gloss it is a tinted lip treatment this treatment goes on thick and stays a bit sticky it is light and not loud and provides long lasting protection from the typical environmental elements overall this is a good product that looks nice and provides some benefits i would buy it again
4	i can say your man will love it because i am a man and i love it ! i got this am juicy perfume for my wife , and she likes it we both agree it has a very sweet smell that has strong hints of vanilla \( despite the fact that nowhere is vanilla mentioned in the product description \) with a bit of peach and cotton candy in the mix others have described it as light , but my wife said it is a strong fragrance in her opinion , and it lasts i actually like it better than my wife even she enjoys it but i think the sweet aroma is extremely pleasing and it is n't floral at all \( i do n't care for floral perfumes and thankfully neither does the mrs \) four stars from my wife , five stars from me which means it gets four stars my mama did n't raise no !
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	i loved this bright shade a lot so much that i bought two ! i am african american but i think it will work for many skin tones it 's great !
4	have more acne than before , too oil for me
4	the nozzle on this product is extremely difficult to depress especially if you have joint problems , but if you want volume for sagging hair , it will definitely provide it i would advise using it sparingly , especially if you have short hair as i do , as it will make it rather gunky but if my hair is looking limp and i'm getting ready to go out , a few quick sprays will immediately help it look fuller i have found that i need to shampoo it after one use usually wash my hair every day anyway might be different with longer hair
4	it 's okay
5	the new lip gloss from julep that is the best is called lively it is a cross between a burgundy and a strawberry julep lip gloss , has a subtle color , shine , and hydration these subtle feel as good as they look julep has an exclusive blend of ingredients , just look on the packaging i apply a small amount of lip gloss across the middle of my upper and lower lips to create the illusion of fullness it glides on smoothly , feels good , and lasts for several hours this co , or lively will look good on most everyone it makes my teeth look whiter , my lips fuller and more attractive recommended prisrob 08 03 16
5	i have very dry , cracked skin on the soles of my feet , to the point where flakes of dead skin form and i have to shave them off since i started using dead sea essentials tea tree oil foot cream , i 've noticed less flaking and an overall smoother and softer feeling on the bottom of my feet it also as well as moisturizes , which is great given that i work out twice a week with my trainer not only do my feet take a each time i do so , but i worry about how my feet smell after a workout i'm a fan of ahava mineral anti aging moisturizer \( i use it frequently during the summer \) and this is another product in their line that i expect to be using regularly because it performs so well recommended
4	amazingly good product it holds up the toppik powder well and very gentle to your scalp and hair it keeps hair supple and less oily
4	i was really impressed with how smoothly this applies to the skin it really has a nice , silky feel to it the color blends in nicely to my foundation adding a bit of color without it seeming overly noticeable i liked how easy it was to apply and it lasted well throughout the day i 've used cream blushes in the past , but this is probably one of the best ones i 've tried it has nice pigmentation , it blends nicely , and it looks natural
2	foundation choice is fairly personal , so this review is how my skin with this product i am a mid 40s female with a few smile lines this foundation clumped right into them and made them more noticeable the color based on the directions ended up too dark and too yellow the coverage was not bad , not entirely sheer however , it did n't do much to minimize my bit of rosacea i ca n't recommend this product
5	i love zoya polishes and only one salon \( other side of town , of course ! \) sells them this is a great color i wanted something other than a nude pink classic red i could get away with at work , and this is perfect ! i would describe it as a soft , smoky teal not too bright , but enough to get a second look and compliment \)
5	wow ! i love this moisture tint by jouer ! the first thing i noticed is that it smooths on my face really well the second thing i noticed , and it blew me away , is that it really does reflect light ! my face looked light and glowing ! my skin looks so much brighter and natural than when i wear my foundation this is fairly light weight , but heavy enough to smooth the skin and provide some coverage i have dry skin , so this does not replace my normal moisturizer but it 's great to have a skin smoothing tint that 's lighter than a foundation i would definitely recommend jouer luminizing moisture tint
4	i was really worried about trying this because i usually stick to products that are tried and true safe for sensitive skin but , i 've heard really nice things about this company so i thought i would give it a try on my eczema prone skin i washed my face as usual , applied this at night and waited for any irritation at first , i felt a little itching , but that is n't unusual for me when i put product on my face because it 's so hypersensitive i had to wait to see if it got worse it did n't it surprisingly calmed my skin down within minutes it 's thick , rich but not greasy my skin soaked it up i have extra dry skin and this was very nourishing i'm looking forward to trying this daily i do love the product , its rare for me to actually find something that is n't loaded with perfume scent or irritates my sensitive skin i just wish the cost was n't so pricey i would most likely want to give this another try , but i 'll update with continued use to see if anything changes so far , i would highly recommend
5	i used this product several times it clears my pores and does not have a manly smell it 's a very nice feeling mask and does not take forever to fully dry i put it on my entire face and allowed it to dry while i was reading magazines i had an easy time removing the product and it did not gunk up my sink with dried up product because as it hit the water it thinned out and easily i 've had this problem with some sugar scrubs and face masks before \( note this is not a sugar scrub it turns white and has no smell that i can detect it helps clear my blackheads and pores very nicely will use again and again my husband also tried it once , but he 's just not all that patient to sit around doing stuff to his skin he 's a manly man , so i did n't expect that he would latch on to any skin regime
5	i needed to use 3 coats to get good coverage but the color is very nice once you have 3 coats two coats was too sheer and streaky a greyish purple with shimmer for those looking to try this polish please be aware that it requires a uv lamp to dry as well as the base coat and top coat from cnd shellac it is not a traditional polish although the advertising says two weeks of wear , i usually only get a little over a week due to tip wear \( i type a lot \) this works fine for me because normal polish only lasts a day if i'm lucky since i am doing my own nails with this system , the price is just right for a week 's wear if i was going to the salon to have it done , it would cost a fortune i absolutely love that once the process is complete , my nails are totally dry and ready to go no more accidentally smudging them before they are dry it took a couple of tries to learn the exact way to complete the process but there are plenty of videos on line for tips on the best way to use this system
2	good moisturization with no greasiness , but the scent is overwhelming i prefer to not smell like i bathed in old lady perfume
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i am a 44 year old female who has very fine and thinning brown hair which is highlighted blonde and cut in a bob above my shoulders because of my hair type and the fact that i live in the very humid region of the us , it is a constant battle to prevent frizziness i am not exaggerating here my hair looks like i got ! i am always looking for products to manage this , as it is just not acceptable to go out in public looking like that i saw this product in my local ulta store because it was expensive , i was hesitant to try it boy , i am so glad that i did ! this is not your typical flat iron it has a small compartment at the top of the iron where you pour the oil this is a special oil that comes with the iron you one bottle of it when you buy the iron a little goes a long way , but yes , you can reorder the oil separately when you are out of it once you pour the oil into the compartment , then , you turn on the iron it has the typical heat settings \( anything from low , medium or high \) which you control via a small temperature wheel that is on the lower bottom of the iron not the best placement for this , as it 's hard to reach once the iron has reached the target temperature \( the red light will stop flashing \) , then you press a button under the bottom iron to turn on the oil this is a nice feature because you do not have to use the oil every time only if you wish the iron starts \( yes , \) and in this steam is a small amount of this oil you use the iron like a regular flat iron on your hair wow , it works great my hair is so shiny and smooth , i just ca n't believe it and , it lasts me all day also , it takes me less time to use this iron from a traditional flat iron i guess because of the steam \? not sure , but it works great i am so happy to have found this iron i use it every single day love it
5	i 've been using pca facial wash phaze 1 for over a year i love the way it cleans off makeup without drying your skin
5	took a chance a couple of years ago and tried this mascara it tubes your lashes and i 'll tell you , i really put it thru it 's and it passed with flying colors only thing i 've found that makes it come off prematurely is my tears other than that , it wo n't smudge or flake on the hottest , most humid days love it !
4	this product gets an a plus at covering age spots they disappear with the application since i have had several pre cancer spots on my face removed , i really appreciate the protection of spf of 25 that protection should be more than enough only problem that i have with it is remembering to put on again two hours later it comes in a small container with a cap that should not come off in my purse the color goes with my face great except my forehead which seems to be a lighter shade than the rest of my face all in all , a good product
5	this review is for the tizo photoceutical pm restore , 1 fl oz the pm restore has had a positive effect on my skin , and has made it feel much smoother it has also had a moisturizing effect it instantly absorbed into my skin goes on smoothly all in all i am very happy with how my skin now feels after using this for just a few days
5	this is the perfect medium brown color for fall very polished look , and a great change from the normal bright colors
5	generously apply after putting your foundation and everything else on , blush , bronzer , eye shadow and it will keep it from smudging all day ! i have a bad habit of touching my face throughout the day but this keeps it from smudging off i noticed a huge difference in how finished i look not just in the morning but also into the evening it 's very easy to apply dab a bunch all over your face , wait 2 minutes , then brush off the excess it 's pretty fun actually it sets your make up so well to make it truly last longer
5	i have naturally medium beige skin \( i'm naturally not pale but not tan either , but i will very easily tan without burning \) i live in florida now and most of the year i 'll keep my tan now , but i discovered this product years ago before my to the sunshine state this used to be a well kept girl secret before it became main stream but now the secret is out there are several things needed to make this look even and natural first is shower , shave , and exfoliate get the most scrubby salt body wash you have and use it rough off all the dead skin you can to make sure you can to get the tan to last longer if you do n't buy the foam mitt to apply this , you 'll regret it some people use latex gloves but it ends up getting applied uneven and streaky because late does n't absorb the mousse \( on purpose \) but the mitten they designed to apply it with absorbs just a touch to make it apply perfectly evenly also it can be flipped over if you 're applying this stuff without a friend to help get that spot in the middle of your back that nobody can ever reach the guide color will help you apply the product evenly but keep in mind that the color will darken more than that over several hours i let it dry without any clothes for a few minutes then put on a large loose t shirt and large for an hour or so to avoid crease lines and sweat marks in the product while it dries the smell is very faint but the tan will be darker if you do n't wash off the guide color a light white lotion like lubriderm will keep the skin moisturized and lock in the color apply after a few hours shower the next day and your color will remain keep skin moisturized and avoid shaving every day for tan longevity , apply fully once a week if you want optimal tan results full time this product is amazing and with a little maintenance can fool someone into thinking your tan in 100 beach bunny
5	this review is for tizo photoceutical foaming cleanser , 4 oz i use foaming cleansers to clean my face and i generally use luxury or boutique brands what attracts me to this product is that it is specifically designed to help repair , protect and revitalize environmentally and photo damaged skin living in central fl , i get a healthy dose of skin damaging sun on a daily basis and my skin often signs of stress here 's how i use it i wet my face , then apply one pump of the cleanser , gently massaging it into the skin i then rinse with warm water and pat dry i noticed that this product makes my face dramatically softer and eliminates any oil , also shrinking the visible pores on my cheeks and nose i do tend to agree that this product helps with skin tone and texture it contains , niacinamide \( think b vitamins \) , and cucumber extract note that niacinamide , also known as , is generally used in beauty products to help treat acne the product label says this product can be used with complimentary products am rejuvenation and pm restore i am unfamiliar with these products but i do want to give them a try overall , i am impressed with this gentle foaming cleanser and how it leaves my skin i would recommend it to a friend
5	this is actually my first time purchasing an essie polish and i could n't be happier with it ! great , non streaky formula , applies evenly and gives your natural nails a perfect , even base color great for a basic french mani or layered under more bold colors to help them pop the finish was nice and shiny even without a topcoat and i got about 8 days out of it with minor tip wear definitely a perfect sheer pink will absolutely be purchasing more polishes from essie in the very near future !
2	the cream has a pleasant texture when applied and the tightening effect may please some older women but that effect is achieved by drying the skin and the long term effects are not beneficial
5	lovely color ! soft , pretty , slightly iridescent , more on the mauve side than pink great coverage
4	i love the la roche posay brand of products , but this one left my skin too dry in the winter months my skin is naturally oily , but less so in the winter , so i put this aside to revisit when the weather got warmer i 've already begun oil \( it 's only april , sigh \) , so i thought i 'd try again ! this works great in removing my makeup , without stripping my skin this product is a foam that comes in a pump bottle it 's not to be used in the eye area you probably can , but my eyes are extremely sensitive , so i use another product for that purpose recommended !
1	first , the color shown here , which looks like a soft apricot , was actually a garish orange my toes look like i am wearing orange peel ! second , as another reviewer mentioned , the polish goes on streaky , and it was only after much effort , and much time , that i was able to achieve some semblance of coverage i have never thrown out a polish , but this one i did i think i will stick to opi polishes , they have a better quality overall as for this essie polish complete fail , i hated it ! !
1	i was really excited about the concept of this product , as i am a powdered dry shampoo user in the interest of saving water , and thought this be a nice tool in my product collection , but it is truly awful i could see this being possibly useful for someone with really short hair who wants to skip a wash and have some lift if used just in the roots , but even that is hard for me to picture being manageable the product is so sticky and grainy that while it does have the effect of removing oil , what 's left in your hair is way than oil it might look passable , but it feels just terrible , my hairbrush stuck in it and it broke my hair , i could n't wash it off my hands and after three shampoos , i could still feel it in my hair \( getting a comb stuck in it \) , and that was all using a tiny amount , and rubbing it well between my fingers before applying it sparingly i used it once and thought it was gross but decided to at least play with it once more before a shower in case i had used too much or had n't thinned it enough , but no , it was still awful as others have said , the smell is nice enough but not overpowering , which is the only nice thing to say about this product i am certainly glad this was a review item if i had paid the crazy price for this i would be returning it for my money back
5	love it !
5	l'occitane almond supple skin oil , 3 4 fl oz category skin care much to my this product really works love the spray bottle and design too a definite must have for anyone !
4	this product is pretty good it does n't crease as much as the previous product i was using
3	this is a nice light weight lotion in tiny capsules when i apply it , the lotion goes on smoothly and although i do n't have many wrinkles , it does seem to act as a filler or pre makeup smoother i do n't know why it is made this way it seems like an awful expense to place a tiny drop of lotion into all these little capsules the jar is nothing to speak of for such a pricey product i would rather just buy the lotion then have to go through popping it out of purple bubbles on the positives , it does n't smell and is lightweight
5	used for a few days and my skin looks clearer and brighter the serum does n't smell good , very herbal , but it 's ok as i ca n't smell it a few minutes after application the pump does n't work very well though
3	body chemistry has so much to do with how a scent smell on a person that it often surprises me how different the experience can be for me this has a vanilla scent with a very slight musk undertone the third time i used it , it straight up smelled like rubbing alcohol for the first couple of minutes and then settled down it last 's about two hours
3	meh does n't last very long
5	i know many people do n't get the purpose of thermal water , especially the evian thermal spray people tend to associate evian only with drinking water , and find this aerosol to be no more than a gimmick thermal water works wonders to balance the ph of the skin , especially for sensitive skin it can also be used to refresh the skin throughout the day some even use it to set their makeup because of the fine , even mist i keep mine in the refrigerator and use it first thing in the morning after washing my face my son has very dry skin , he suffers from eczema , and loves to use it every few hours to add a bit of moisture and refresh the skin ive tried several types of thermal water vichy , la roche posay , avene and the evian is hands down my favorite ive been using it for about 8 years now its mostly due to the fact that spray nozzle sprays evenly and is the most consistent , bottle after bottle the results from the other brands are practically identical , at least when it comes to its effect on the skin , but evian is just more dependable theres no leaking from the nozzle , no uneven spraying , no clogs , and all the water gets used up if your skin is missing a touch of moisture , dewiness , need a new toner , or a way to refresh your skin with or without makeup , give this a try !
5	perfect color
5	good to set up makeup and not seem chalky when you leave the house
5	this chapstick , while pricey , is really good i only have to apply a few times per day as compared to constantly with regular chapstick or i think long term use is keeping my lips really soft in this wintery weather
5	super !
4	silky , smooth feels light and goes on clear there is n't much of a fragrance , maybe slightly citrus it 's silky and feels like it could be similar to olive oil but not greasy it soaks in quick and works well before makeup too i noticed it felt smooth , but i did not notice any changes in my skin i did like the fact that this was organic , it made me feel better about using the product the serum comes out in measured amounts that is perfect ! overall , i am really happy with the product if i notice a change in the next few weeks i 'll update this post !
4	from the female of the family some time ago i was the cologne counter , looking for a special gift for my husband , and i came across london burberry it was at first sniff ! it 's been my favorite thing to scent on my man ever since recently i discovered that burberry london has an eau de parfum for women as well i thought i 'd give it a try first comment this is an entirely different scent than the man 's version when i first some on , i thought it might be a little too sweet or floral \( probably the honeysuckle \) , but those top notes soon fade a little , and i really like the effect i ca n't match the company 's own write up so here it is elegant rose and a sweet heady blend of honeysuckle deep heart notes of tiare flower , jasmine and peony are with a whisper of fresh zest solar notes of sandalwood , musk and patchouli i was n't sure what tiare was , so i looked it up it 's probably better known to you as gardenia a fragrant tropical flower is a type of tangerine , so that is the citrus i was a little taken aback by the patchouli worn too heavily , that is the classic scent of years ago however , you 'll probably be pleased to know , the patchouli is so blended , i ca n't pick it out i'm do n't usually trouble myself with product boxing , but i do like the whole package by burberry if you are buying london as a gift , ladies , the box itself looks good understated and yet expensive it is printed in the check pattern of the bottle itself a of good things to come i do n't like the women 's version of london as well as the men 's , but i do find it fresh and summery recommended
5	i used to use this and for some reason stopped and tried other things i'm happy and relieved i'm using it again , because it works ! it seems to do an excellent job providing heat protection while also keeping my hair soft and manageable it 's slightly pricy for a relatively small bottle , but you only have to use a bit , so it will last forever i personally like this a bit better than biosilk , for i think it does a better job without making my hair greasy looking at all highly recommended
5	i love essie polishes essie products are very consistent in the quality it goes on smoothly and dries very fast
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	nothing like butter london nail lacquer i found that lee did not work well with my salon gel manicure
1	this stuff is seriously awful i was looking for a change from orly top to bottom because of its bluish tone and bought this i did n't need to straighten my nails , but thought that something extra is always a plus now i'm ready to cry i used it only one time and six of my nails broke my nail polish started chipping after one day of wear it was chipping with upper part of my nails now i have cracked , damaged awful nails that i have n't had in years this product ca n't be called nail straightener it should be called nail killer ! don't buy it !
5	i did n't expect this product to actually remove my pimple overnight , but i had this one blemish on my chin for 2 weeks , applied the drying lotion , and boom , gone in the morning ! definitely a great product !
5	as expected nice blue color
4	love cnd products , and this color is fine if you can handle bright turquoise nails until your next manicure great for maybe a specific outfit , but it is a very bright , bold color with a shimmer i much prefer any of the cnd shades of purple
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	this is a very thin , water consistency , toner cleaner that is hard to adequately apply even with a cotton ball which is relatively given its high price tag it takes lots of squirts to get enough to actually remove makeup the benefit here is that it 's a water free wash , but i still strongly free good old fashioned ponds cold cream for gentle , complete eye makeup removal this did n't leave my face feeling overly dry , but it also was n't as soft as my normal ponds , either this was gentle and non irritating , but just not something i 'd ever buy again , based on effectiveness vs price point \( long story short eh , it 's ok , i guess , but it 's way too expensive for what you get \)
5	i mean literally this smells like the clinique fragrance called happy if you like that fragrance you 'll love this having worked in a salon for over 34 years i can honestly say i can detect any perfume and its name quickly
5	i tried dermablend some years ago and did n't like it because it looked really cakey and thick things have changed ! this foundation goes on smoothly , does n't cake around fine lines and wrinkles , and smooths out skin tone very nicely you can apply this foundation with a sponge or with your fingertips \( as i do \) and it goes on smoothly after waiting a few minutes , it 's a good thing to set this foundation with a light brush of powder the coverage is very good and this foundation stays in place for about 8 hours before it needs touching up it looks quite natural in daylight and office lighting , i think i have very sensitive skin and this product did not cause breakouts or irritation it 's a very clean foundation with no oils to clog pores one thing the color runs a bit darker than expected , so i would recommend purchasing a shade lighter than you might ordinarily buy all in all , i'm very happy with this product
5	this color is very pretty it 's very bright yellow i love the butter london brand already great hues , love the brush and it last a long time i highly recommend this polish if you 're looking for something bright and cheery
5	i am hooked on butter london 's and the liquid lipstick collection is no exception i love the application and coverage it easily glides on like a thick gloss and then the consistency eventually becomes like a lipstick it 's does n't dry out my lips , which is what all the 's are consistently about , and somehow it lasts longer than your average lipstick , gloss , balm or stain this color is a sheer deep red so is not as deep as a matte and can go on by itself or used to layer over another color it has a very yummy vanilla scent and a doe foot applicator
5	i have used concealers for years as i have always had dark circles under my eyes and red discoloration on one side of my nose due to broken capillaries i have always used my finger to put concealer on and its been less than optimum for me as it results in uneven coverage the scott vincent borba concealer brush allows me to apply my concealer with a level of detail and consistency i have never been able to achieve before to be honest , i had never even considered the possibility of bacterial contamination from putting my hands in my concealer product , but that makes sense , too the tool fits well in my hand and is soft on my face , so there is no pulling on the tender skin under my eyes i can get the product into the area between my eyes and nose where previously i had problems with too much or too little product and having to dab at it with tissues to try to get it right the only thing that is a consideration with this tool is the cost for me , as i use concealer all the time , i would spend the money to get a great tool if you do n't use it all the time , it may seem to be too much to spend that is a personal decision i can say that it is an excellent product and one that i am happy to use
4	my wife like this liquid foundation as it gives a dewy effect to her skin she also like the fact that there is spf factor to this foundation great for keeping her make up routine simple
5	this stuff is great i have a of my hairline and this product helps cover it up perfectly ca n't tell at all i have this in my hair and thats the way i like it highly recommend
5	very pretty good quality polish that is easy to use looks as pretty as a french mani highly recommended if you are in a hurry or do n't want to pay for a salon white tip mani skip the tips and use this
5	very pretty color
5	this mask tightens and freshens skin it is so nice it can be on the drying side during the winter , so maybe skip it if you have dry skin it smells nice i apply with a mask brush , which helps me get a perfect layer sometimes , when im feeling dry , ill apply only also no the t zone this makes my skin look and feel amazing
5	cutting fingernails is always an annoying task the cheap little are uncomfortable to use , require a lot of pressure to make their dull blades cut , and shoot the fingernail tips across the room then the little hunt begins , as i search the room to try and collect the tips i 've tried more expensive ones , from better brands like tweezerman \( they do make great tweezers \) , but the only thing i seem to get for the extra cash is a larger size they 're still dull , they still shoot the tips across the room , but at least they are bigger so , i took a risk and tried this one , not so much because of the name , but i liked that it won a design award , had a cool look , and \( my went \) even if it turned out to be no better , at least it looks really good imagine my surprise when this little beauty arrived it has a great bead matte finish that looks like titanium \( it is actually stainless steel , according to the packaging \) the little instruction book was tiny and impossible to follow , but who needs instructions to figure out a nail clipper , right \? well , after thinking it was n't working \( the blades would n't quite touch when i squeezed \) , i finally figured out that the handle has to be raised and then pulled out and up , to settle in a groove on the lever \( this will make more sense when you can play with one yourself \) that allows more leverage , and makes the blades close all the way so , if you get one and it does n't seem to work , play with it a bit longer and you 'll figure out the lever trick the blades are incredibly sharp i remember when i got my first set of real kitchen knives from henckel after using the cheap kind for years the new knives were so sharp it took me a while before i was n't accidentally cutting myself here and there i just was n't used to having to be careful with them this clipper is that sharp and the real benefit \? no more tips shot across the room ! turns out that was happening because the dull blades of standard clippers pinch the tip off instead of cutting , and that makes them fly off with this one , they just fall right off with no force behind them it is great , and makes me look forward to the task they are a bit on the narrow side , so it will take multiple clips per nail to do the job i do n't mind this because i like to have more control over the curve , but it is something to be aware of , particularly if you 've been using the more expensive , larger styles also , the leather pouch that it comes with is incredibly stiff , and it is a real effort to jam the clipper into it it does loosen up a bit with use \( i 've had mine about six months now \) , but the quality of the pouch is not as high as the clipper what 's that \? a work of art that works \? that 's what this is ! attractive enough to be in the of modern art , and effective enough to make you round up your collection of older clippers and toss them in the trash the price is a lot if you are n't sure it works , but it does really , it is worth twice the cost , and looks the part you 'll enjoy this one ! sean p logue , 2008
5	finally , something that works for my super sensitive skin ! i started experiencing red , uneven skin as a teenager no one suggested rosacea , because it was n't severe and did n't look like the photos of course , to a teenager , it all seems severe as an adult , the redness mostly subsided recently however , it came back and was accompanied by a light , raised rash and some white head type bumps i could tell they were n't pimples and i quickly discovered i have a mild form of rosacea this product came into my life at the perfect time ! using this once a day has truly evened out my skin it only takes a small amount , so it will last a long time i alternate this with a regular serum that i top with 's acne gel \( which is a tea tree gel that works well with rosacea \) although this is pricier than my usual skin product , it 's well worth it this does n't clog my slightly oily combination skin i usually wear it alone , but it smooths fine under spf or foundation so glad to have found this product !
5	not greasy feels great on my skin and provides excellent moisturizing properties
3	this face cream is n't greasy , went on easily enough but it 's a bit too heavily scented for my taste it is allergy free , i just wish they 'd cut back on the scent for a face product
4	since i do not use make up for obvious reasons , i asked my wife to give dermablend intense powder camo foundation a try below is her review of the product i am attempting to switch from bare escentuals , a product i have used for years , because it no longer offers the amount of coverage i need i chose a medium shade of dermablend intense powder foundation makeup because it claimed to have greater coverage without the heavy feeling of liquid makeup medium is the shade i wear in most makeups , so i figured this would be similar to those when i received the product and opened it , i knew immediately that this medium was not going to work for me i tried it on and realized that it is far darker than i expected , with an unattractive orange tint to it i did put the makeup on to see how it covered in case i wanted to try a different shade it does offer fairly good coverage , covering my acne scars well without leaving a cakey , heavy feeling behind while i usually forgot that i was wearing makeup with bare escentuals , this make up is a little heavier , but i guess that is the sacrifice i need to make in order to have better coverage i have not yet purchased a different shade to see if it matches my skin color better
5	if you use enough of it , it does a great job
5	this is my everyday go to lipstick , and i hope they never discontinue it \( as they did my beloved lipstick last year \) the color is just dark enough to make my lips look finished , the color lasts reasonably well , and there 's no dryness or stickiness , and no unpleasant flavor i also find the tube lasts for several months , even with multiple applications everyday i do n't notice any plumping action , but that 's not why i wear lipstick i keep trying buying other brands of lipstick , but just come back to this one
4	i 've had little pots of this moisturizer before and i 've always loved how rich and creamy it is it does a great job moisturizing but it does n't have an spf , so i always need to put another lay on top of it , unless i wear it at night the pot is small along the lines of a sample size i love vichy products and there are some that i'm never without , such as nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy 89 hyaluronic acid serum moisturizer daily skin booster to hydrate plump and fortify skin 1 69 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy 89 hyaluronic acid serum moisturizer daily skin booster to hydrate , plump , and fortify skin , 1 69 fl oz a a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy puret thermale 3 in 1 one step face wash cleanser and eye makeup remover for sensitive skin 3 3 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy puret thermale 3 in 1 one step face wash cleanser and eye makeup remover for sensitive skin , 3 3 fl oz a
2	after having a spot on my arm diagnosed as skin cancer , it was suggested i go through skin checks by a dermatologist besides obviously limiting my overall sun exposure , my dermatologist recommended that when i do go out in the sun to use a sunscreen with an spf of 30 or higher and one that is broad spectrum \( protects against both uva and uvb rays \) this nia 24 sun damage prevention 100 mineral sunscreen spf 30 meets that criteria in addition , it contains pro niacin , which according to their labeling , is clinically shown to visibly improve skin tone , texture and hyperpigmentation it has a light scent , is color and dye free , and is made in the united states all of this is good now for the negatives their labeling also states , this product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn , not skin cancer or early skin aging in addition , this product is not water or sweat resistant if not rubbed in all the way , your skin appears white i was able to receive this product free of charge from the amazon vine program when it arrived , i was surprised at just how small the container was , especially considering its price i personally cannot justify spending that much money on a sunscreen that may or may not help my skin look any younger than considerably less expensive sunscreens i will stick with more affordable brands
4	essie np partner in crime is a great fall color ! it is not as light as it looks in the bottle people have asked if it was maroon or black on my nails more often than asking if it was brown but when i tell them it is brown , they compliment it i was worried that the brown may look weird on my nails , but i really enjoy it !
4	i originally bought this line of shampoo , conditioner , and masque from my hair colorist , figuring it was to try it out at least once before going back to my usual drugstore brands i am now a believer in this line , it absolutely keeps my red hair vibrant between 6 week touch ups well worth the price if you are already investing in having your hair professionally colored my one star off is for the container , not the product the very large bottom cap is perfectly suited to having the bottle stand properly up on a shelf , but far less suited to actually dispensing all the conditioner within once the product is down to the last 1 3 \( see photo \) it is impossible to pinch it to get the rest to come out i resort to cutting open the tube entirely to get at the last contents , hardly ideal
4	this would be a perfect product for my fine , none too thick hair that gets in the front and flat at the back crown , except it smells amazing , like honey , but not too strong it has a gel grease sort of texture , but not sticky at all a dab did not make my hair greasy , or my husband 's , which is super short it just gave it nice style no flaking however , my gray and white hair wants to pick up yellow color on the porous ends , and this has caramel color i wondered why it was a nice honey color , and and found out why nope if it were clear , i 'd be all over this my husband , who has more dispersed gray will enjoy it
5	i really love this mask it 's smooth , clean smelling , and produces a nice clean affect it does rather remind me of the clinique clay mask i have used from time to time , only this one is nicer \( it 's smoother and does n't flake as it dries \) i love that you can actually still move your face when it 's dry it 's not overly drying , either and it did help with a breakout issue i do recommend , even for somewhat sensitive skin like my own
4	it 's an eyelash curler it works the way you would expect any eyelash curler to work the pad on the bottom half is teal , and made of a gel like material that is soft , but it 's really no different than any other eyelash curler i have tried eyelash curlers only pinch when they are used incorrectly it does come with two extra pads , which will be great as long as i do n't lose them before i need them ! \)
5	i 've read the other comments , and all are however , here are a few things one needs to know before purchasing if you thought this would look like the bottle all by itself , with a standard one or two coats , you 'll be disappointed this polish is best used with other colors , or if alone , more than two coats yes the polish dries rough , and somewhat matte , to fix this use their top coat and the colors will also look much more intense also , i believe this polish was intended to be a topper , or an added dimension to an under coat of color , either opaque glimmer , or cream color if used on top of a pale pink , and topped with a gloss , the effect is girly to the max , , , also , depends on how many coats one uses top a red and you 'll get more gold if used alone , over a standard base coat , try building up till the color intensity suits your look this could be three or four while matte looks are a statement , the makes using it that way less appealing this polish like it would be glossy , but it 's not , not by itself this can happen with almost any of the polishes that have actual glitter in them all in all this is a very versatile , flexible polish to have in your bag of nail tricks the key is to get creative and have fun with it
4	this brush is soft and a great size the package says the bristles are hand cut and i believe that because mine was quite irregular the handle is odd and its not smooth , it 's or wrapped in , hard to tell
1	i am a fan of mario badescu products i have recommended them to clients with skin sensitivities and in most cases they have been very happy with their performance once in a while , however , i come across a product which i am not as fond of this , unfortunately , happens to be one of them what is this cleanser like \? a nice sized bottle , i do like the color of the cleanser it reminds me of ice cream the texture of the cleanser is very creamy and thick it has tiny flecks of dark green in it which is the seaweed the fragrance is a touch overwhelming for me , however i am not sure what it is it just is not a smell that i enjoy a whole lot the label stays on and does not come off like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href mario badescu the moisture magnet spf 15 2 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 mario badescu the moisture magnet spf 15 , 2 oz a how does this cleansing soap perform \? a little goes along way of this stuff it is thick and creamy and a delightful green color the cream smears around on the skin nicely and when adding a little bit of water to it , it does foam up some , but is not really sudsy like some soaps can be it does make skin soft at first , but then i feel as if the skin is too stripped the time that i am testing this in is a time of humidity and more oiliness and this cleanser is stripping my skin already in winter , i am thinking it will be way too much for me to use i have normal to dry skin i have had my daughter test it she said it was nice at first but felt it stripped her skin a bit too much in both cases , the skin surface felt smooth , although dry and tight i have not had the men try it yet they do n't like to try new products it is hard to pin them down the worst part itching the worst part about this cleanser is that it made our skin itch a bit perhaps it was from drying it out so much or maybe the sodium laureth sulfate it contains , but it just makes the skin feel uncomfortable no matter how much lotion i apply , it does not seem to soothe this feeling entirely the bottom line great sized bottle , lovely texture and green color , this soap seemed promising creamy and easy to use without being overly foamy , i found the fragrance to be a bit overwhelming and it left our skin stripped and a bit itchy and uncomfortable and tight i have given this one star if you have very oily skin and perhaps do n't mind it being a strong cleanser , then perhaps you would like it for us , it really is rough on our skin and it just leaves us too uncomfortable to rate it higher than that
5	it 's not as bright as the picture it 's like a neon grass green in reality and i ca n't get enough of it ! it 's such a unique color a must buy for the polish obsessed !
5	i recently had the chance to try out a few dermablend products , and this is one of my favorites while i do n't have tattoos or large marks to cover up , i do have veins and bruises that i wanted to hide when i wear skirts and dresses this summer this does a fantastic job of doing so i still will use my sally hansen leg products for daily summer use , but this is great to use underneath for darker veins and marks
3	this product did not work as well as the buffering lotion did for me you do feel a tingly feeling when applying it on acne affected areas , that could mean that the product is doing its job it might just be my skin i 'd try it as all skin types differ i 'd still say that the buffering lotion is much strong than the drying lotion though , you can know that just by the in smell , in case you have severe acne , i would reccomend the buffering lotion instead
5	i use this every night before bed with the super smile toothpaste i am complimented on my smile my dentist wants to know who i'm on him
5	this is my second purchase of this product and wo n't be my last it smells like christmas and my hair feels smooth but still had body love it
5	great for travel
5	great product , it really works for men and women controls frizz as much as you can with a spray product
5	i have been cnd for a year now and love it very fast service and will order more
5	one of the things i dislike about concealers is that it can settle into otherwise invisible lines around the eyes and make you look older , but vincent longo perfect canvas concealer the surface of the skin and keeps your complexion smooth it 's capable of concealing shadows under my eyes even after i pull an all nighter my eye luggage is n't very dark , so i ca n't speak for how well it covers darker shadows i have been using a dab on a freckle right at the edge of my lip and it covers that well , too i also like it as a light foundation on my eyelids when i use shadow it 's light and sheer in feel my skin is quite fair but the medium works surprisingly well for me i do n't use very much and i feather it in i rarely use any foundation \( mineral powder or otherwise \) with it yet the concealer remains invisible , blending smoothly with my skin do make sure you moisturize before putting it on or it wo n't work so smoothly this concealer pen is a twist type and has a sponge that lets beads of concealer come through i love this style of makeup , but there are two things you need to know first , do n't think as i did that it 's broken or dried up it 's not it simply takes a lot of turns to start it up the first time secondly , watch the little window on the side of the tube once it starts flowing or you 'll waste product i'm very happy i tried this product and will continue using it
5	the product arrived at time it does the job it meant perfectly , needless to say i am very pleased 10 10
1	my daughter used some of the polish and lacquer at her mother in and thought it was good so i ordered some it did n't work well for me and i would like to return it
5	i 've been using this as my daily spf product for face and i 've been very happy with it because it is a mineral sunscreen and it is not tinted , it may leave a bit of a white sheen layer on your face this is not a problem with this particular product but rather a feature of pretty much every non tinted product in this category \( if you need a tint , there are products available from cotz and coola that should suit your needs \) the texture is a bit more lotion like than some of the other mineral sunscreens i 've used lately i find it non irritating \( have been using this on my face neck etc once a day for a week or two now \) and it has not caused any negative skin reactions i really like the way it dries , almost powdery and it 's very good as a base for liquid foundation i feel like it 's giving me good sun protection i do n't spend a lot of time outside but i have n't noticed any tanning here are the ingredients since i did n't see them on the product page titanium dioxide 1 5 zinc oxide 17 dimethicone , dimethicone crosspolymer , caprylic capric triglyceride , glyceryl isostearate , acid , silica , salicylate , polysilicone 15 , dimethicone vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer , iron oxides , peg ppg 18 18 dimethicone , , tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate , green tea extract , cranberry fruit extract , pomegranate extract this does contain some silicones if you are watching out for those i'm happy to see the vitamin c \( ascorbate \) and plant extracts , which will have a lot of antioxidants to add an additional layer of protection against sun damage right now i think this is my favorite sun protection product for the face , having tried several in this price range
5	i like that this serum really tightens the skin on my face you do n't need a lot to see results right away this serum has no fragrance , so it wo n't interfere with perfume or anything else i have sensitive skin , and would normally break out if i put anything on my face , but this did n't make me break out at all i love this serum , but i wish it came in a bigger bottle although you do n't need a lot , it is still something you would need to replace once it runs out
4	so basically i'm not a super duper girlie girl i'm fine with the basic skin products you find at your local drug store still , when this popped up in vine , i figured i 'd give it a shot it seemed to be about being organic and i frankly wanted to know if that really makes this little container worth about six times as much as the big bottle of what i 'd usually buy at said local drug store first off , i'm kind of confused about what can and cannot be labeled organic but they did put that label on most most of their ingredients organic or not , none of their ingredients seem too offensive \( unless , of course , you 're allergic to them \) there is a slight scent but it 's not very offensive , which is good as my body really really really dislikes most scents i tend to get migraines or just sick to my stomach if there is a chemical scent or even a natural scent that is too strong this did n't bug me as for how it works i have pretty dry skin it absorbs anything with moisture then wants more more more this kind of just sat on top for awhile before finally get all sucked up it does n't take very much the old a little goes a long way my skin does feel fairly decent after using it but i'm not sure it 's any better than the cheaper alternatives i have available to me i 'll use up what i have but probably would n't buy it again only because i'm a cheapskate and the cheaper stuff does n't aggravate my sensitive skin if i did n't have alternatives that already worked for me , i 'd probably go ahead and use this very sparingly i said i'm a cheapskate
1	after 2 uses it already started cracking and separating there are n't many other mitts \( the ones that i have tried are as bad , if not worse \) on the market so i do n't really have a choice but to get another one of these
5	great
5	dermablend 's quick fix concealer stick with spf is smooth and creamy as a lipstick packaged similarly too goes on smoothly and stays smooth without moving into wrinkles or in any other way stays put all day and into the evening has none of the waxy or cakey feel that some other concealers have just fine , smooth , easy to apply coverage that really keeps blemishes and other discolorations hidden all day without drawing attention to itself on me , most concealers eventually move into lines and wrinkles and make me look worse , not better dermablend does n't do that it 's a great brand that is true to its claims
5	works really well , very happy with it !
1	this is almost white not nearly the pink they show in the picture wo n't buy polish on line again
5	my family tried the phyto mix and mask hair trio i tried the , and it is awesome on older folks like me , it smells awesome and made my hair feel fuller and smell great my 11 year old used the and she loved it too , the smell is awesome , she has longer hair and it made it shine but nor greasy the wife tried the extreme , she also loved it , said her hair had more bounce and shine i wish they had easier names to say , but what a great product for sure
5	high quality tint a little bit goes a long way
3	i 've never used a cover creme before so i was surprised at how thick this is you are supposed to take it out with a small plastic they give you \( it has the consistency of cold butter \) then warm it in your hands to make it pliable before application well , it does cover things but it is also very messy and too dark so dark that it could be a contouring color on a normal palette so for most people this color is too strong
5	beautiful color , nice and shiny , wears well makes a great addition to anyone 's polish collection !
5	very nicely packaged if giving as a gift nice subtle cologne , does not come across as over powering , and lingers on with just the right tones , for a reasonable amount of time will last your evening out i do not like overly strong ones like drakkar noir i used davidoff cool water before this one , and this is equally good my wife likes and so does my daughter on me
4	i do n't know how people could say this is a weak scent , but i guess that could be true if you like your fragrances really , really powerful i do n't so , this was even a little too fragrant for me right out of the bottle but once it was on my skin , i found it to be really nice definitely feminine , but not in a ridiculous give me a headache kind of way it 's a little deeper and more powerful from my normal sweet and light scents , but i'm happy to be changing it up the only thing i do n't like about this perfume is the way it sprays on it 's a little too concentrated of a spray instead of a mist like i 'd prefer however , the bottle is really sleek and pretty and would look nice left out on a bathroom counter
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	love this , running out , need to buy some soon , best micellar water ever !
2	polish chips very easily love the color
1	i wanted to love this ! i did , i truly did felt great , skin looks amazing but it did not stay put ! i took a nap on the with this on and it got everywhere ! so sad sent it back search continues sigh
5	anyone who works at a desk a lot \( and puts their elbows on the table a lot \) will love this my elbows were so rough and as soon as i put this on them they immediately started softening up after a few days they will be the softest part of my body ! the stuff smells great and the container is big enough to last me quite a while great for all over the body but the elbows , knees and heels surely need it it does n't feel greasy although it does n't dry really quick either i usually put it on after my bath so it has plenty of time to soak in good before i go to bed great stuff !
3	when i saw a hint of dryness under my eyes compared to the rest of the face , i went straight for this product because of the hyaluronic ingredient in this cream yes , it hydrates the skin very well , but not with satisfaction the cream is thick , heavy , and does n't absorb very well if i happened to get too much , i could n't do anything else but to smear it out more to other areas of the face there were some mornings i woke up and the skin underneath the eye lashes was so itchy , but i was n't 100 sure if the eye cream causes it another lesson to learn from this product is that eye cream lasts very long because i use very little st a time , so i should never buy the jar package again as it 's not very sanitary over a long period of time after 3 months and the jar was still almost full ! !
2	i have only been using la roche posay for a few days my skin is a bit oily , and i'm older i found this to be drying , looked cakey , and felt heavy on my face which makes me look older this has a very light wonderful scent to it i think my olay total effects , pore minimizer is more of moisturizer , , with a nice lite coverage is by far better for me \( got it from amazon \) going to keep trying this when i do n't go out if i found this gets better with time , i will be back for a different review
5	this diaper rash cream seem to work really well on a very small rash that my daughter developed in the diaper region it is an extremely sticky white cream , but once it is on her skin and inside the diaper , her skin warms it to where it melts and spreads to provide a good coating it cleared up a diaper rash in about 24 hours , and though it was n't a bad rash , it had persisted a few days prior to trying this on it
5	tried very many methods of using this curling iron none of which worked at all on my hair totally my previous review and this is what worked today first off no curls per se tried many methods that brought this iron down to a 2 star but i kept along and now voila 5 stars ! my hair is heavily highlighted , shoulder length , fine hair but thick in quantity today i let my hair dry naturally then used the iron , mid heat setting , for about 30 seconds per section let results just stay and finger styled and after a few minutes with a styling product for that purpose the end result for me was fluffy , casual waves pretty happy hair today
5	i love essie nail polish and this will be a favorite of mine it looks like turquoise and that is my favorite color
5	this is my holy grail of pimple creams ! it is very drying \( hence the name ! \) so use sparingly ! that said , this really helps to reduce large spots overnight for me !
1	my primary polish is opi , but i thought i would try something new without chemicals this polish is thick , clumpy and does not last or shine like opi !
5	good things come in small packages right \? this is a tiny tube but packed with a really nice hydrating lotion it only takes a tiny bit to get good coverage all over my face i like that it sinks in but feels rich i do n't need to reapply and it does n't leave my face looking shiny or feeling greasy
5	i have this shade already and i still absolutely love it
5	feels good , cleanses , refreshes , takes off makeup
5	one of my new favorite curling irons now
3	ok do n't bad not good
5	love the color it is vibrant and does not chip receive many compliments
4	the color is a unique neutral shade that seems a blend of gray , brown and lavender which result in a color that most closely resembles , but is not exactly , taupe it looks good whether on toe and and fingernails and is a nice subtle change from colors i usually select the polish is thin and smoothed out easily , drying within a couple of minutes i applied two coats , and for longevity , used an inexpensive \( s \) base and top coat after almost a week , the polish is wearing well with a re application of the top coat a couple of times during that time period the bottle is distinctively shaped but because it is easy to tip over , is somewhat impractical containing only 27 of an ounce when many other brands contain 50 , the result is less product for a cost higher than many other polishes it is hard to judge , but i am not seeing a clear distinction in quality to justify these differences but , with make up items the decision often rests in personal preference not an in depth analysis i really like the color
5	very light color i'm pale and it matches my skin tone it 's subtle , but it 's great fro everyday wear
4	this rose water spray smells so lovely and fresh , and i love the rose design packaging , which i am a sucker for any good packaging the smell is wonderful , and the spray feels good with a mister top bottle that works great my only complaint would be that i still needed moisturizer after this spray as it left my face tight however , as a toner and cleanser this works very well the smell alone is worth the spray and i even sprayed this on my bed pillow , and in the air a few times , which of course is not the intended use of this item the price is amazing as most rose water sprays are much more costly than 10 also , this is not oily which i love , and definitely is a mood enhancer so , for the price and the lovely smell as a toner and cleanser this is well worth the purchase
5	the scent is n't as bold as i imagined it would be from the product description it 's a light fragrance that 's not overbearing , yet lasts for several hours fresh , slightly sweet fragrance this is a nice choice for work , or in close quarters the clean , modern design of the bottle stand blend in anywhere
2	this is not soft enough to leave a line on eyelids it works fine for eyebrows and applications i did apply some for a patch test and there was no irritation , which is a good thing
5	this is a lovely summer color and it thrilled my granddaughter that is all i need to know ! it was delivered promptly and as described
3	i 've been using the crepe erase duo for three weeks now , and here 's what i have learned the exfoliating scrub is is definitely the better product of the two , the body treatment cream is super thick , and i really ca n't tell any noticeable difference in my skin as for the scrub , a little goes a long way i 've tried to find more information about the tiny beads used in the scrub to see if they are or not , but i have not found any answers so i feel a little guilty using it , but it 's not too harsh and leaves skin feeling great the body treatment cream just is n't for me it 's very thick and takes a while to apply evenly it also leaves my skin feeling too greasy many reviewers have commented on the pleasant scent , but i do n't find it all that pleasing , it 's pretty strong for my liking especially for skin care and treatment overall , my skin feels good , but i observe no significant difference there are other products out there that i prefer i'm glad that i tried the crepe erase duo , though
5	this silicone face brush is a cleaning tool and massager in one as i use it with my cleanser to thoroughly clean my face , the massaging action stimulates the blood to my skin , making it healthier in addition , it exfoliates my skin , a fresher more vibrant layer below the subtle vibration of the softly dotted silicone surface cleans the face , making the skin feel alive there is a variety of textures on this palm sized brush , making it even more versatile the silicone surface does not bacteria it is very quiet and easy to clean one charge last a long time i have been using mine for well over a week , and i have never even charged it once it comes already charged i was given a free brush in exchange for an unbiased review
5	nice product have always loved pevonia !
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	because i 've only been using it about two weeks , i ca n't comment on the long term effectiveness of this serum type cream however , i do notice a soothing , cooling effect under my eyes when applied and i believe i do see some puffiness reduced \( the puffiness under my eyes after a long day is minimal at most but i figure it 's good to know about a product that at least partially addresses what it purports to do \) this is the first such product i have ever used so i cannot compare baxter with similar products but i can say that i do like what it appears to do when applied in a thin coat under my lower eyelids it 's very mild , no stinging just a slight soothing sensation and a smoothing of the skin in the area however , it is quite expensive and i have n't noticed any long term effects so while i like the product , i'm not quite sure it 's worth it if i notice that the reduction i'm seeing begins to last beyond 12 hours or so , i will update this review and upgrade to five stars no odors , goes on clear , and a little bit goes a long way
4	i'm a big fan of vichy 's skin products , but this one is n't quite as effective as the other products i 've tried it 's good rather than great after several weeks use , i find the results ok but not spectacular the packaging says that your skin will appear dramatically smoother and plump i do think it 's helped with smoothing my skin , but i have n't seen the plumping effect the lotion is very moisturizing combined with the vichy aqualia serum that i apply first , this lotion has kept my skin from getting even the least bit dry during winter the lotion is very gentle and has n't irritated my sensitive skin at all it 's not greasy and it 's absorbs very quickly it 's very rich and it takes only a small amount to cover my face and neck i like it enough to keep using it for now , and i'm curious to see how the effects will be after 2 months or so of use
5	great color
5	great color !
4	smells amazing and my hair drinks this stuff up wish it was less expensive , though
5	works fast and really covers the thin spots just be sure you pat it in and give it a spray with the holding spray otherwise it might flake off washes off easily
5	my absolute fave nail polish color i'm dark skinned and it is beautiful on my nails
5	long lasting worth it !
5	love this color it just might be my new summer color it has just enough sparkle with a beautiful pale pink
4	my wife is using the vichy puret eacute thermale soothing eye make up remover , and it does a great job removing eye makeup gently she has sensitive skin \( and everyone has sensitive eyes \) and this does n't cause any issues with that and actually refreshes the eye area it has a light , refreshing scent and it 's gentle and safe enough to use around our young eye areas when cleaning away face paint as well , and has even come in handy for myself as a quick substitute eyelid cleanser when i ran out using just a bit \( a little does go a long way \) on a cotton pad , it leaves the skin around the eyes feeling soft and moisturized , even while being an effective cleanser , making short work of eye makeup \( usually just using one pad \) ultimately , it works very well even though it might be a bit on the pricey side , considering how delicate the areas around the eyes are and how many products there are that are n't nearly as gentle , i think it 's worth the asking price , especially since a bottle will last a good while \( after over a month , my wife still has half a bottle left over \)
5	beautiful sheer gold color applies smoothly opalescent , i love it ! the name is also fitting for the color very pretty
5	this looks amazing in sunlight it 's not quite a neon but it 's definitely bright and noticeable i love this color because i 've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink , and this is perfect ! the formula is typical essie kinda gloopy and thick but not too bad
3	the jar is very pretty i like the red and the wood like lid it looks very nice on a counter top it 's also a good size and will last a while it has a strong scent that lasts for quite a while it 's a nice flowery scent , but it is very intense this is a very thick moisturizer and seems to do a great job , i just prefer a less powerful scent it 's not something you could use if you wear a perfume i did n't feel like it was greasy or took too long to absorb overall , it 's nice , but i would n't buy it again because the scent is too strong for me
5	i used jane iredale products several years ago when i wen to a salon that carried them i kind of away from them after i moved from that area i now remember how much i liked them these shadows go on softly but will build if wanted i have really fair skin , so i appreciated being able to lightly apply some of the darker shades the shadows are silky and soft and do not crease on a normal day 's use the shades are attractive neutrals that look good for day wear , but the darkest shade can be used for more drama the case is a plastic gold color that is also very pretty i am going to get again with iredale make up i forgot how much i liked them until now ! !
3	i'm not sure i like the taste of this toothpaste it has a strange that puts me off it tastes great at first but the longer i brush , the less i like this strange taste i was n't sure what jasmine , which is a flower , would taste like but i knew that there is such a thing as jasmine tea and that it 's quite popular most conventional toothpastes are too strong for me and i'm not really a fan of strong mint but i'm not sure i like the flowery taste of this marvis flavor i tried the ginger mint flavor but it 's way too strong and makes my eyes water i do n't think there 's such a thing as toothpaste but i'm going to search for it anyway i would rather have something fruity , like orange tom 's used to make an orange flavor that was available at the drugstore but i have n't seen it around for years that one was great for me because it did n't have much mint i will use this marvis jasmine toothpaste up because it was so expensive , however , i will continue to look for something without mint and something that does n't taste like a of flowers i find the jasmine taste very unpleasant and absolutely dread using it but for the price , i will have to bite the bullet and suck it up like a big girl and manage to use the full tube , even if it takes me a while i do n't put much on the brush because i'm not a fan of the taste if i get a , it 's solely the fault of this strange tasting toothpaste i guess if you like jasmine tea , you might like this flavor but the of flowery toothpaste is totally lost on me in a word yuck !
4	so refreshing you need this in your life lol i love this stuff i use it throughout the day to up and give my skin some love
5	love shellac nail polish and as always best quality product thus far the only thing keep in mind your screen does nor reflect the true color it is more sparkly pinkish color , still 5 stars ! ! !
5	lovely red ! really rich and with very subtle sparkles it is amazing how this cnd products work ! they really last and for me as an makeup artist and cosmetologist is great because i constantly wash my hands and i have to be very neat with my hands as they are always showing off ! love shellac !
5	i was doubtful this would work especially when i saw the foam is blue ! i am so happy i was wrong ! this worked great on my hair , i recently dyed it and it was brassy this product not only took away the brassy look but worked as a styling product highly recommend !
3	i thought the color would be more on the pink side , but it had a slight orange undertone at least on me which was not flattering at all
2	i'm a fan of dermablend great concealers and powders , but this foundation was n't my favorite for one , it 's a lot cooler \( pink \) than i was expecting \( i got the shade yellow beige \) it does n't feel heavy on the skin , but it looked very mask like it did last on me all day and it was very full coverage , but it did n't look good
5	this stuff is amazing and smells great
4	essie is by far my favorite nail polish ! i needed a good green color while yes , i do like this color , it is not as thick as i would like
3	i did n't see a miracle of a difference , and once it is dried , the residue is very difficult to remove ,
2	i wanted to like this product i tried it a couple times , but i just ca n't use it any more it 's got great ingredients and did make my skin soft and for that i give it the 2 stars for me though , first of all , i really did n't like the scent i'm not sure what it was about it that did n't please me , but it certainly did n't smell good to my nose secondly , the moisturizer felt really heavy and on my skin and felt like it did n't absorb very well i guess that 's really all i have to say so , for the price , i would not buy this product read the other reviews though , this may be just personal preference
4	the julep brand of cosmetics is new to me a little research revealed that they sell a full line of cosmetics , nail colors and skin care \( including some enticing korean style cleansers \) , plus they offer a monthly subscription service the price and quality seem to be in line with some of the mid range department store brands \( mac , benefit , urban decay , bare escentuals \) the color combo \( coconut \) is very wearable and they complement each other well the lighter of the two is gold with a slight undertone of pink and the darker shade is a medium brown much lighter than i expected based on the photo both are frosted i apply my eyeshadow with a short bristled , square brush and it went on rather sheer i think if one were to apply it with a traditional applicator , it would definitely provide the full coverage advertised , but i prefer a subtler look , so the sheer look was fine i applied the gold to my lid and the darker shade in the crease to give my eye depth because there was n't as much contrast between the two colors as i had anticipated , the effect was , again , extremely subtle but at my age , that 's preferable and because neither shade is particularly dark , i think either would work nicely on the lid the texture was not quite as creamy as mineral based shadows , but was n't dry either , so there are no worries of the eyeshadow flaking down onto your cheeks as you apply it velvet is probably a fairly accurate of the consistency and look overall , a very nice product in two very wearable , every day shades that will work on almost any skin tone
5	wow this eyeliner is like none i have every used before the liquid ness of it means that it dries on and stays on generally , my eyeliner has worn off within a few hours i 've worn this several times now and i can wear it all day and it will still be going strong it 's quite dark a true black , compared to the pencil shade of black that i'm used to it 's very easy to apply , but do n't press too firmly unless you want a very thick line overall , i really like this liner and plan to try it in other colors very pleased !
5	update it works brings the bounce back to my skin it is so soft i am over 40 this is the lightest in weight firming cream i 've tried i still follow original directions apply to wet skin before towel dry this jar is lasting too ! used half dozen times head to toe barely made a dent i just skim my finger across the top it melts into my skin will def be buying this again ! original review apply before towel dry , after shower to wet skin i do this with oil in the shower bc it absorbs best these were the specific instructions i gather by other mixed reviews , that may not have been done i 've attached a picture to show how the cream melts into wet skin my skin is so soft i could feel that bounce in my skin you get with a firming product there was no smell when i opened but when it turned to silk as it hit the water on my skin , there was a soft rose smell a nice soft rose smell , not like your grandma my fave part , after i dried off there was no residue just silky soft skin this cream is fantastic may be my new favorite
5	i absolutely love this color first did the base coat , then had to do two coats of the blue last was the top coat
5	in the future i will be ordering the large size love the cleansing soap along with the cleansing lotion , eye cream and thank you for all the little samples
5	amazing acne system for mild to moderate non cystic adult female acne
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
3	this is a great moisturizing cream i used it on my face and hands and it left them really hydrated and soft , without feeling greasy i also like the ingredients however , i could not get past this product 's scent it has a really strong flowery scent i am sensitive to strong smells and this was just too strong for me it did not seem to dissipate for a long time unfortunately , i do n't think i can use this cream due to the strong fragrance if you do n't mind strong scents , this is a great moisturizing cream with nice ingredients however , if you have an aversion to strong scents , you should steer away from this one
5	with so many blushes on the market , it is difficult to figure out which ones might be the right ones for your complexion and skin type vincent longo blush is not cheap it is on the very expensive side of cosmetics is it worth it \? that depends size this compact comes with of product for comparison , let 's look at some other products and sizes mac blush 3 lorac baked matte satin blush 5g mac regular blushes essence breaking blush 5 5g tarte amazonian clay blush so , do you get a lot of product \? yes is it worth the high price \? that depends texture and color depth vincent longo dew drop radiant blush is a very finely milled powder blush which has almost a creamy feel to it the color of this blush is unique it has a matte appearance with a slight bit of satin to the finish which gives it more depth than just a matte blush would be this blush that i tested \( sandalwood \) is a peachy pink with silver and gold droplets of satin shimmer that means that the shimmer is almost undetectable when you look at it the droplets are interesting because if you swatch it with your finger , they look like they disappear if you run a good blush brush over top of it , they are very clearly to the bottom of the pan all of the way through not just on the top layer there is a slight scent but it is quite faint and not at all invasive it disappears right after application i would have to say that the first blush that comes to mind that had similar texture was longevity this blush is interesting the first few times i tried it , it did not last all day and seemed to fade within a few hours the next time it seemed to last most of the day i have worn this on its own , with the vincent longo primer , and also with the vincent longo foundation it lasts from half a day to the entire day on me who could wear this \? i tested the sandalwood color which is a beautiful peachy pink for color comparisons here are a few things i can compare it to nars orgasm blush this is a slightly more pink and matte version of this color lorac velvet rope much less pigmented and much lighter peachy pink mac blush same color family but mac version is more pigmented smashbox blush the smashbox is very close in color and pigmentation but the vincent longo is a bit more pink i have tried this blush on a variety of skin tones from mac nw25 \( bare escentuals medium \) , to mac \( very warm pale ivory skin tone \) and this color looks natural but really looks best on the warmer toned skin especially the skin tones on the medium skin tone it tends to blend into the skin more and not look quite as nice the pigmentation is lighter than most blushes however , it does build up if you want it to be darker final comments and observations if you want to apply this a good dense blush brush is the best way to go finger applications do not work well this is a beautiful velvety soft blush which is one of the most finely milled i have used \( and i have used a great deal of high to low end products \) and it is truly luxurious to use the compact is very thin but it does come with a mirror you will have to purchase an additional brush to use it is it worth the money \? if you like very subtle blushes with a more matte feel with the depth of a satin , you might want to try this i am thinking that you would want to keep limited to medium or light skin tones for sandalwood , but other colors might work for a more intense blush appearance on medium to darker skin tones for the price , you will get one and a half the amount of product as most major blush companies provide , so again , take that into consideration all in all this is a very nice blush product and i recommend it if you do n't mind investing the money if you are looking for another less expensive alternative , you might not get quite the high quality in fine milled product , but you can duplicate the appearance for less in other brands despite getting smaller quantities for your purchase
5	love this product makes my hair softer and shiner and does n't make it look greasy !
3	obagi skin care is a medical grade skin care 360 line of product is fairly new and i was curious to try it because i have never used it before this exfoliating cleanser comes in a nice box and it is a generous size that can last for a long time what worries me about the product is no matter how good it exfoliates the skin , it barely has any natural products in it it is loaded with artificial ingredients water \( aqua \) , acid , decyl glucoside , glycerin , sodium cocoyl isethionate , cocamidopropyl betaine , sodium , sodium methyl cocoyl taurate , acrylates c10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer , fragrance , phenoxyethanol , caprylyl glycol , sodium pca , panthenol , sodium hydroxide , chlorphenesin , ethylhexylglycerin , hexylene glycol , disodium edta , sodium hyaluronate , , carbomer , 1 , 2 hexanediol , from this extensive list the only ingredients that i can recognize are panthenol sodium hyaluronate and i guess \( which is enzyme from fruit \) is the exfoliating agent the unfortunate thing is that it is so low on the ingredients list that it is basically telling that there is a very small percentage of it included in the formula for that reason , i am giving it only 3 stars
5	the hold on this is pretty solid and has a nice matte finish , which is particularly useful for the messy effortless look you can style hair in a number of ways without adding too much weight or thinning it out like gel can \( because you get these skinny little instead of sections \) it makes hair easy to style for short looks , and it works for relatively stuff if you finish with some spray it also resists humidity well and can be even with days of just wet a bit and blow dry \( or if you have hair , just wet a little \) downside \? if you like fresh clean scents or traditionally masculine scents , this is n't it it is very sweet and heavy i hate it some might like it personal preferences , you know \? but if you like citrusy , musky , or clean scents like rain , ocean , linen , etc , and dislike very sweet stuff , you 'll be with me on this one
4	this delicate , unscented cream goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way so it 's economical to use i find that it does a good job of moisturizing without being heavy or greasy and my face feels softer after i use it it 's absorbed quickly , leaving no sticky residue i 've worn it both alone and under makeup and for me it works well either way if i apply it 5 minutes or so before i put on my bb cream , it does n't interfere with it at all i really like the pump applicator it 's very convenient to use and dispenses just the right amount of the cream while at the same time keeping the contents safe from oxidation and contaminants if you spend a good deal of time in the sun , you might prefer something with a higher spf but for me and others like me who get only slight sun exposure , this offers decent protection
5	my wife tends to have oily skin in the summer and this is great for oily skin ! she says it really great to take care of oil and to clean out the pores to keep from getting any breakouts she says it 's one of the better masks she 's used and she likes it a lot
5	i have very very sensitive skin my own skin doctor recommends this product , and now that i have received it from amazon , i am giving it a try i do n't n't to hurt my face however , so i am beginning by putting it on my neck in a very small area i do n't feel any pain from it right now although we certainly have a lot of reviewers here who do n't seem to like this product i am on the fence at the moment if it works for me , i will come back and make a note of it i may be one of the people who ca n't handle the strength of the ingredients in obagi nu derm clear fx i am the perfect age to be using it however if my skin can manage to accept it
3	while the color is fun and trendy , had to apply three coats a light hand with application is the best way to achieve a non streaky effect between the base coat , three coats of polish , and a top coat , it is prone to chipping easily
1	my husband has been using toppik for awhile now it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head , which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair and in the sun , it actually turns a pinkish red \( he uses dark brown \) ! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie even with a bit of wind or humidity , the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face , making it look like tar it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still do n't know that he uses the product ! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind , constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product , and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it does n't even bother me , my husband constantly obsesses over his hair instead of enhancing his look , toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place
4	what a great perfume for an affordable price it 's a bit different more floral than my wife typically uses , but i ca n't help but say i was delighted when she finally decided to try it out the scent really blended well with the other products she uses , and softened quite a bit as she wore it i'm a huge fan of it , and am glad she got it
5	great product ! i have extensive hair loss issues and this product has me to go out with confidence
3	i got this foundation through the amazon vine program to review i am always looking for new and interesting foundations this is an interesting foundation that is in a neatly sealed package that keeps the foundation moist it is very pricey for the amount of foundation you get it feels a bit weird when you put it on , very cool on your skin because of the water in it i applied it with a foundation brush and you really have to dig the brush into the foundation to get enough product on it the color , bisque , was great for my winter \( sun deprived \) skin my skin color is usually light to medium when i first put it on i was super impressed it does n't give great coverage , but it does look very natural and glowy and does a decent job evening out your skin tone it feels great too once it dries , very light you barely notice it 's there unfortunately i was really not impressed with the staying power after a couple hours i noticed it had rubbed off my nose and was starting to wear off on other portions of my face as well it failed the nap test how my make up looks after i take a nap the whole side of my face that was on the pillow was rubbed off i tried putting my favorite winter primer right now , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href herbal foundation primer dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 herbal foundation primer a , on underneath it but that did n't really help the staying power i tried using my summer primer , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href cotz face natural skin tone spf 40 1 5 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 cotz face natural skin tone spf 40 , 1 5 ounce a , under it and that worked better the cotz product provides some coverage by itself and this foundation sat on it nicely and seemed to stay on a bit better i have somewhat oily skin and definitely needed to use a powder to set this i ended up using both nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href neutrogena healthy skin pressed powder dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 neutrogena healthy skin pressed powder a nbsp and nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href rimmel stay matte pressed powder dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 rimmel stay matte pressed powder a nbsp to set this both powders worked fine and helped a little with staying power but not a ton i do n't think i will be using any more of this foundation the coverage is just too light and the foundation rubs off way to easily the water in the foundation also makes my foundation brush get all clumpy and goopy i will be sticking with my current favorite foundation , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href tarte cosmetics amazonian clay 12 hour full coverage foundation dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 tarte cosmetics amazonian clay 12 hour full coverage foundation a pros smells nice initially provides a nice natural and glowy looking coverage neat packaging to keep the foundation moist good for sensitive skin \( did n't make me break out \) cons hard to get good coverage , is n't very buildable and does n't cover redness or age spots well the foundation is wet which clumps up my make up brushes horrible staying power , rubs off easily even with primer and powder to help set it expensive for the small amount of foundation you get no spf , so you will have to either get primer moisturizer powder with spf instead
5	purple is my favorite color this rocks \)
3	an overwhelming number of hair products promise to deliver stronger , silkier hair among this me too ! array , phyto stands out for its unusual mix of ingredients and mostly for its delivery mechanism , which involves tiny glass vials and a dropper \( i cut the tip off the dropper because i could n't figure out how to make it work otherwise and could find no directions anywhere nothing like a scalp tonic to make you feel stupid ! \) the dropper lets you apply the liquid in the vials to your scalp again , not much information on strategy is available , so i it the fragrance is pleasant despite the ingredient list , it does not smell like chocolate and the product does n't gunk up my hair i can well believe that the concentrate is having a positive , albeit subtle effect on my scalp , and also that it might take a few dozen vials and many months before i can determine whether or not it 's worth continuing to use the little vials are truly adorable and i am trying to figure out a creative for them , as tossing them into the glass would feel almost keep in mind that with this product you 're getting less than 1 5 ounces total , or about 7 10 teaspoon per application there 's a lot of waste involved , and thus , as fun as it is to play bathroom chemist , i am researching similar products with a less complicated delivery mechanism p s this tonic is not for the challenged the day may come that researchers discover a way to grow back hair where none currently exists , but this is not that product
3	i was introduced to the wonderful world of wet shaving last year because the razors themselves are usually so pricey , i had gotten the brush and proper shaving soap much earlier , and the razor was a birthday gift i used proraso shaving cream from the tube for years , so it was time to get something new obviously , i ordered this the container itself is very clean and blank , which actually catches the eye using it the first time , i applied some with just my fingers i found it to be incredibly thin , having to use double the amount than when i used proraso the next time i used it , i used my brush i have an omega badger brush , and it 's worked well over the past couple of years i rinsed the brush in warm water and lathered it right in the bowl still , the product was a bit thin it was obviously much better with the brush , but i had to use more than my previous cream at the price , i may not order this again the actual shaving was fine , and it has a nice scent , but know that you may have better options for the cost
5	\( purchased form ulta \) right now i have oily combination skin , but mostly oily on t zone and cheeks i decided to get the regimen kit by this company , and in it is a sample of this product i cleaned my face and used the toner , then tried this item i loved it instantly it goes on so smoothly and easily you only need a tiny bit , even my sample will last a week or two with how little i need to use it sinks in my skin and leaves me with a nice velvety finish the next morning i woke up to smooth skin ! no oil ! i was so blown away i went and purchased the normal size it 's pricy , i never usually spend more than 7 on a product so this is new to me but i want to take my skincare seriously and will make the investment also , i got another free sample of this cream with my full size purchase from ulta
4	not my favorite color , but lasted long on my nails looks a little more orange in person
3	scent is a very personal thing what works for some does not work for others in this case i am in the other category to be fair to lacoste very few perfumes interact well with my body chemistry about the only two that work without changing chemically after i apply it are joy and that said , i did n't care for the smell of this at all i looked at the description which describes it as an elegant , sensual fragrance that captures the natural intensity of soft floral notes on a relaxed , warm evening eau de lacoste sensuelle opens with the tangy of ripe and lush the heart has the rich elegance and femininity of rose the base finishes with the of the accord i did n't find it to smell at all floral let alone that of a black currant or rose and actually the smell reminded me of 's angel which also reacts badly in terms of smell with my skin after about 30 minutes , the perfume had a very chemical type smell my rating of three stars is my personal feeling towards the smell of this perfume right out of the bottle as i said it smells similar to 's angel i did n't get a real feel for the above described floral notes
4	good stuff just who you buy it from alot of old stock expired old packaged bottles works on hair and face , works even better and stays fresher in fridge , nice smell and lite moisture , not sticky or sweaty feel
4	these wipes are great they are soft , gentle and have a very mild baby scent after my daughter would finish eating , i would wipe her face with other wipes and her face started drying it so much i ended up switching to these wipes and her face no longer is dry and is nice and soft they are definitely expensive so i would n't really use them as regular wipes past the first couple of weeks of a baby 's life i used these in between baths when she was really tiny to freshen her up and they worked wonderfully for that purpose too we always have these wipes in the house and the only reason i am taking off a star is that i would love for it to come with the snap top like the picture but it comes with an adhesive top that does n't really work great at keeping shut i usually put these wipes in a wipe dispenser and hope that i do n't have to carry it anywhere !
5	i originally heard of this product from my dermatologist , but the they want over double the price ! i have used this product of over three years and love it ! it smells great and keeps my face looking hydrated and smooth
3	goes on smoothly and feels silky , not greasy or heavy edited to add unfortunately , the product does clump i see it at my hairline and eyebrows , looking like dandruff this means it ca n't be used under makeup , e g but only for uses and then has to be washed off carefully get the cotz , it does n't clump at all the sunscreen value is high and the scent is minimal , just an unscented cosmetic odor , not objectionable there are no parabens i have n't had a chance to research all the ingredients , but it seems to use alcohol as a preservative for me , it 's a choice between this and the cotz face broad spectrum spf 40 , which comes in different skin tones but has a lower spf i think you ca n't go wrong with a sunscreen with this high of an spf rating
4	i only have 30 days to get my review up , so i'm rushing my assessment a bit i will be sure to update the review as time goes by i have enjoyed the product very much so far particularly , i like that i do n't have to use very much of it to get full coverage on my face it is not sticky or greasy at all and goes on clean and smooth with a very pleasant smell i do n't know 100 about any changes in my skin or signs of aging , but i do know my skin feels better using this product i will continue until the full container is gone and see how it turns out but , right now , i'm very pleased with it and would try it again
5	when i saw the price of this i knew it would either be worth every penny or not worth a dime i have only used this for 7 days and my face looks amazingly brighter and softer and just lovely i'm blessed genetically but this stuff really made a difference i love the container you simply press down and just the right amount of product is dispensed and you 're not contaminating the entire jar of moisturizer i detect no scent this does not leave my face greasy either i have combination skin and it works very well on every type of skin on my face i adore this stuff will continue to buy , even though it 's pricey , because paying for crap products that do nothing is far more costly than just getting the good stuff love it
5	favorite sunscreen ever
5	my boyfriend uses this pomade it looks and smells great it gives a nice shine and has a light hold i use it once in a while too
5	basically a white ish nude ish color , and good shine , i love opi it stays on without chipping longer and the colors are great
5	love this stuff what a difference ! and i got it pretty quickly
5	color is shear , but a nice pretty gold
5	this curling iron is the best curling iron i have every used ! i used my friend 's to curl my hair for a wedding i was in , and i bought one soon after ! it works very well !
4	i like the cream , kind of heavy \( good for night time \) applies nice and absorbs quickly , slight scent but goes away i would repurchase for night time use
4	so my kids run hot and this product helps out keeping them fresh and it does help styling their hair this is sort of strange to me as i'm unclear as to how something that can help style hair is also for skin those two things seem like they would n't go together , but mustela did it i guess it 's sort of a very liquid cleaner and lotion i have no idea what magic is used to make the product but it does both things
2	i love essie nail polish , but for some reason this one chips off very easily maybe it 's the shimmer
5	although i was provided this product to test , it is not my first sample a couple of weeks ago i finished up a tube of la source ultra moisturizing hand therapy , purchased to replace an empty tube of the same product this is a hand cream i regularly buy , and will continue to do so because of its superior ability to soften and moisturize winters in my part of the country are cold , and hands are often exposed the dry air can quickly cause chapped skin , and if i am not conscientious it may cause cracks around my cuticles i alternate between a small group of products and this is one i faithfully keep in mix because it works and is absorbed quickly i can apply it any time without needing to wait for my hands to return to a non sticky state within a minute of application , skin is not greasy or tacky the scent is most pronounced as soon as applied but dissipates within a few minutes the fragrance is hard to describe , but is essentially a unisex crisp clean smell the product does not turn back the hands of time , but it is a truly excellent hand cream , and given the multitude of empty promises around cosmetic products , that is enough
4	ahava is one of the best brands the company has a reputation of high quality skin products this one is no exception my husband , who is accustomed to foaming creams , noted that the blade went over his beard easily and left his skin soft the shave was close , and there is an excellent aroma associated with the product i believe if he were more accustomed to shaving gels , rather than foaming creams , he would have liked it more and could make a more accurate comparison i would think women could use it to shave their legs and underarms the moisturizer additives are a bonus also , i have never used an ahava product that did not meet or my needs it 's not junky i do n't understand everything they mix in it , but it reads well !
5	have not been disappointed at all
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	love it !
5	the best
5	first , packaging this container is so cute that when the lotion is all gone , i will def keep it and use it for something and place it where it will be seen major thumbs up two , the smell amazing ! ! ! ! i ca n't pinpoint what it is there 's spice and a bit of musk and i think i detect something floral three , the texture a perfect cream goes on smooth , dries quickly , smells 12 hours later , and does not leave a greasy residue four , allergies i have sensitive skin and have not had any issues with this lotion no rash , no nothing very happy with this product and tempted to buy the perfume
3	i gave this product to a friend known for her long , thick , beautiful hair she used it both as a leave treatment and with a ceramic flat iron and it worked great in both ways her hair came out straight , shiny , smooth , and luxurious however , she is sensitive to smells and she warns that this product is quite pungent it smells like a combination of axe body spray and old spice it 's masculine and sharp it also off in humid weather
5	thanks
4	cade shaving cream has a fragrance like the forest after a rain definitely more masculine , although women may like it too the large silver tube is classy looking , and the brown and black packaging even has writing on the side in which i thought was a cool touch the cream , not shaving foam , will take a little getting used to , but if you follow the instructions , which tell you to wet your skin and massage into the wet skin , or use a shaving brush to make a lather , it works just fine i found the emollient factor was perfect and my skin felt smooth my husband liked shaving with it too this would make a great gift for the man in your life
3	so , mixed feelings from me on this let it be known this will probably work wonders on many a face but there is an intensity this that not even proactive has that seems less useful and more confusing the formulas work well with my skin , but it also takes a lot out of it , even with redness on some days i'm dealing with this my back my use of this system to once a week now , for severe acne , this trial by fire might be just the ticket
5	this stuff is great i have a of my hairline and this product helps cover it up perfectly ca n't tell at all i have this in my hair and thats the way i like it highly recommend
5	okay , so you know how some cosmetic treatments are coming in this little tube with a press top that lets a small amount out of the tube \? this product has that feature at first i was concerned that a bunch would squirt out , but nope , just the right amount i placed a small amount on my face and did n't experience any issues it is recommended to use at night and does the magic while you sleep it absorbs quickly and completely and is designed to remove fine lines and wrinkles remove away my love take them all away make me look like i am young again you better believe i will be using all of this product
5	i love this night cream very nice and not greasy
4	although this soft , foam tip applicator for concealer is a great way to apply cosmetics under the eye , i struggled with how to rate it the current retail price is 40 , and that 's far too much for what it is but it 's well made , with a solid , matte finished stick , an angled end for scooping up concealer or foundation , and a plush , foam , teardrop tip concealer applies smoothly and without tugging at delicate under eye skin if this were a 20 product , it would get an easy five stars from me because i do n't have scott vincent borba concealer it was n't offered to me as part of the amazon vine program i used clinique foundation to test it i ca n't imagine that there would be much , if any , difference between how the two are applied i scooped up some foundation with the angled end , placed it on the back of my hand , and dipped the teardrop foam tip into it i swept the makeup under my eye , and it went on with ease blending it was a breeze the marketing copy says that this is a way to keep bacteria out of your cosmetics while it does remove your finger from the bottle or jar , the tip is still coming into contact with the skin on the back of your hand and you still have to wash and dry it if you want to minimize bacteria i rinse mine under warm running water , much the way i would clean a foam when i'm done , i gently squeeze out extra water , and let it air dry because the box does n't contain cleaning instructions , i hope i'm doing the right thing this anti fatigue brush feels great in my hand and is just the right size about 5 long from tip to tip for easy it 's a well made applicator i'm just not sure it 's worth the current retail price
2	the babyliss that i previously had was so much smaller but it threw so much heat and air i loved it the cord was a good 10 feet long , which made using it awesome , i could stand in my hall way to make sure the dogs were not getting into trouble this babyliss is so much heavier , i can barely hold it away from my head i get tired holding it in one hand i can barely dry one hair strand before having to switch sides i have to keep going back and forth to dry the rubberized grip is so slippery after getting out of the shower and using lotion or hair products , holding this super heavy hair dryer is so hard it keeps wanting to slip out of my grip and i'm nervous i 'll drop it it definitely has enough air flow it really blows out and it seems to get my hair dry faster than my old babyliss the heaviness and worrying is too stressful i love the babyliss but this one is not the right one for me
2	this is just not for me it charged ok , but buttons are difficult to work , i have to press multi times to get it going once it is working i have doubts on any dark circle reduction i cant keep it facing the correct way and i end up with one curve up and down i do n't like watching it pulling on my delicate eye area like i said just not for me
4	this is a very gentle cleanser it smells good my face feels soft after using this product it is expensive but for irritated skin it is a must have this line also have an amazing calming cream that works well with the cleanser yes , i would buy again the product was well packaged and arrived on time
5	this is a beautiful light color goes on soft but has depth it 's hard to explain , it is a light gold and brown but they are easy to see the color it stays on even after i tried wiping it off they gold is very soft and it is shimmery without all the glitter and flaking that happens with other shadows
4	i'm a jack black fan i have lots of their products on the shelf and use them all the time most of which i have purchased through amazon but a few came free from vine for evaluation this product is one i got for evaluation and i tried it with their shampoo the results were excellent on my thin hair my wife tried it too and her hair is much thicker but the results were equally good lots of soft feeling tresses the scent is fresh and minty herbal without being flowery excuse the expression it smells manly why 4 and not 5 stars \? the recommendation to use a quarter sized amount is too large i tried a dime sized penny sized amount \( my wife says pea sized \) and it worked just fine also , they say apply the conditioner first and leave it on while you wash the problem with that is the product does n't wash off easily i feel a slippery film on my face , arms , etc if you wash first and then rinse off the conditioner , you have to to get all of the conditioner off i checked with my wife she says that happens to her too does a great job on hair , smells minty , but is hard to rinse off
4	love this color as another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery i used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color it looks great just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color
5	this eye cream really brightens the eyes and diminishes lines pleasant orange scent i 've seen a significant change ! it 's amazing !
4	this light oil is formulated with rose hip extract not rose hip oil it has the consistency of water and no discernible odor absorbing quickly , it left my skin feeling moist and refreshed it is to be used after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing avoid the eye area the plastic drop bottle is small but a little goes a long way rose hip extract is touted for its anti inflammatory and anti oxidant properties i have suffered no ill effects from using this product and am impressed with its gentle hydration
5	pretty good peeling cream
4	update my experience has gotten better with this brush ! the falling bristles seems to have stopped so i'm happy about that and i 've found it does extremely well with a bb cream i just tried ! so , perhaps i shall go with the 4 stars if i like the brush , and if i would recommend it , and purchase it if i lost it or it became too old , then it deserves my stars \( though , knowing me , i 'd try to find it on sale , or one like it for less d \) this is one of those updates i love to add , when i determine that the product is better than i first thought and i'm sold ! rating explanation really , 3 5 stars \( 4 0 for the softness and for how foundation does n't cake onto the brush and how it blends in well 3 0 stars for bristles falling out and the price being a little high compared to my usual foundation brush , which was half the price and does the job well , too \) general description a small , handle textured , soft bristled brush black , with a tiny loop with which to hang it \( after washing or if you want to hang it otherwise \) price now about 21 00 general comments makeup brushes can be expensive , but i probably would not spend 21 on this brush since on first use some of the bristles fell out not many , mind you , but after that happened i read a few other reviews and found that after washing this has happened with my experience , it was right out of the box i lost some bristles as i applied my foundation as directed so , for review purposes , after one use , i gently washed it as i did , a few more fell out \( again , not very many \) after drying , i used it again and a few more came out in all total , there were not very many bristles to fall out but this does make me wonder if this is normal upon first few uses that in manufacturing some bristles are going to be loose and with use this will stop , or if with continued use and washing more and more bristles will fall out time will tell but this does seem to be an issue with this brush applying foundation as the instructions indicated , i applied liquid foundation right to the brush i placed just a tiny amount , for i wanted to do this in a layering application i swirled the small dab of foundation on half my face \( for comparison with my regular makeup brush on the other side \) the brush is extremely soft on my face this i did like very much and my makeup disappeared into my skin quite quickly i put just a little more foundation on the brush and swirled that into the same side of my face and again it disappeared it was a nice finish , i will say when i applied my foundation with my regular flat bristled foundation brush on the other side of my face as i usually do it , i really could not tell that much of a difference , though there may have been a slight difference , but not enough i could really say for sure my foundation brush is half the price of this one positive point 4 0 stars for this one difference between this brush and my regular foundation brush that interested me is that my regular foundation brush you can see the residue of makeup on it , but the japonesque did n't have any residue that i could see ! that in itself was pretty amazing perhaps with more use it would but i believe with small applications and it in thoroughly , most of the makeup would end up on your face and not left on the brush which is a good thing negative point bristles falling out , and the loop is pretty small not sure where i'm to hang it i would like to try this with mineral makeup \( i am out of that right now \) to see how it does but i expect it to do well with mineral \( powder \) make up i would n't use this as a blush brush simply because of it 's shape however , i suppose it would blend in blush very nicely
5	love it !
5	this is my favorite essie polish in the orange family it is perfect for fingers and toes in the summer stays on well too
3	pretty color , needs too many coats , chips easily
5	great stuff , really improves your nails great smell i use this at night every day
2	i read all the reviews and was a bit concerned about breakouts , but so far i guess i 've been lucky i 've been blessed with good skin but have begun noticing some deeper lines around my mouth and between my eyebrows so that 's where i'm focusing right now i do think i see some slight improvement which makes me very happy i'm not looking for miracles , just improvement yes , it 's pricey but no prescription needed , and the tube should last me quite a while i wish it was fragrance free because i'm quite sensitive to smells , but thankfully the scent dissipates after a short while it definitely appears to be the actual product and not fake as some reviewers have mentioned honestly , i do n't know how the tube could be emptied and anyway yes , there are quite a few chemicals in this , and i am careful not to overload my skin with artificial ingredients , but i 'll continue to use this if i see results update 03 04 17 well , i cannot use this after applying nightly for probably two weeks \( per directions \) , suddenly i broke out in burning , red , dry skin where i applied it between my eyebrows researched retinol and discovered mostly recommended to apply every few days to build up for sensitive skin redness has not subsided after 4 days and because it makes the skin hyper sensitive to sunlight , this will definitely not be staying in my house
4	its fine
1	smells wonderful however it irritated my hands , arms , chest , neck everywhere i put this thing on gave me pimples do not waste your money
2	i'm not sure what to make of this mask after using it , my skin is definitely softer , but i ca n't say that there is any noticeable benefit this has not or brighten my skin , nor does it offer much in the way or purifying or clarifying my skin it 's nice to use to calm my face or just to enjoy the feeling of having a ton of on my face , but i would n't purchase this again when it runs out
5	i 've been using this for about 10 years this always makes my hair looks so shiny and smooth
5	i am loving this julep konjac sponge ! i have sensitive skin , so the konjac is perfect the texture is soft and like a cake but it is very strong and because of all the small and it is able to grab up dirt and oil and dry skin from your face and wash it away i found the konjac dried very quickly and was easy to clean after use the sponge is a gentle exfoliate and helps to refine pores when you add the green tea that is antioxidant rich the sponge is a more efficient cleanser i love it comes with a string and suction cup to stick to the side of my shower the size is as it fits into the palm of my hand and coverage is great to clean my face
5	beautiful this color
5	great neutral color i think it would look good on most skin tones one in the set of oprah 's favorite things 2013
5	i do wish there was a way to tell when there is sparkle in a product this does have a little sparkle in it , but is a pretty color
4	mineral water based moisturizer which is advertised to fortify skin up to 48 hours of hydration \( i ca n't vouch for the 48 hours claim \) \( i do n't have sensitive skin \) i applied the gel moisturizer to my cleansed face which i let air dry i started with a small amount , about the size of 1 2 a pea , lightly massaged it into my face and neck it immediately dried i decided i needed a bit more , so i repeated with the process using slightly more gel the 2nd time each time , the moisturizer quickly absorbed into my skin without leaving my skin feeling sticky or tacky i am at the age where the skin on my hands is crepey so i decided to apply some to the back of my hands the moisturizer made a marked improvement to the look of my hands a 2nd application showed even more improvement i did n't use much either time i wo n't be using it for my hands , i just wanted to see if it made a difference it did there 's a mirror on the lid which i just used when i applied the moisturizer the fragrance is n't overly strong , but i'm not crazy about it kind of reminds me of the scents used in the past a subtle rose scent the list of ingredients can be seen in amazon 's product photo
5	i was skeptical about this cream , even though i had read many good reviews after 2 weeks of use , my skin was transformed nothing magical , but it evened out my skin tone , my huge pores look slightly smaller , my skin looks more plump w a nice glow it is n't greasy , which i really like most creams are very greasy i have sensitive skin w slight rosacea on my cheeks this , i believe , has improved it no sensitivity either , like most skin care products i was using for over 15 years , but this works just as well , if not better , almost 1 2 the price
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
4	but not a miracle worker that makes zits completely disappear by the next day lol a visible improvement over night , reduction in size of blemish but still a lot redness
5	my dermatologist recommended this and i have n't been disappointed
5	i really do like this brand a lot and i find with their colors that you definitely need a good top coat so the polish does not chip and i do n't have to re do the color during the week
5	have always loved this cleaner
5	zwilling j a henckels ultra slim nail clipper do an excellent job the construction and design of these clippers make it that they take up a very minimal amount of space per following the instructions on the packaging my husband and i were able to figure out how to properly these for trimming finger and toenails you simply slide the top part toward you to unlock it , then push that part all the way away from you , and then back toward you again to put the clippers into a cutting position closing the clippers is just as easy as opening them , once you get the hang of it the cuts are clean and never rip , tear , or leave one with the need to file ones nails after the storage pouch is black leather and the clippers stay inside once placed since these are so , i 've out another pair of clippers in my purse and these took their place these do what advertised , take up very little storage space , and appear to be quite durable i certainly recommend for all nail trimming needs
5	i recently got the worst adult acne on my back and face i have ever had i apply this with a q tip on the affected areas after either i tone with pure rubbing alcohol or witch hazel \( usually back , chest and cheeks \) , wait 15 minutes naked then put on my pajamas and go to bed the smell is pretty bad and my room has this smell lingering but who cares ! this really dries out active pimples and opens up under the skin cysts i have noticed even when i use a little bit on a pimple not only will that pimple go down , but the surrounding areas will break out less often maybe it 's killing the bacteria that spreads and causes more acne \? either way it 's definitely not a cure all or even an overnight cure but it is consistently effective in reducing bumps and pimples and when you 're dealing with an all out attack , this helps tremendously my only complaint is that it goes by too fast and i have a ton of the pink stuff left at the bottom of the bottle but none of the alcohol liquid that sits on top of it \( so i have witch hazel and rubbing alcohol in it to make it last , it still seems to work this way \) i just ordered my second bottle
3	overall i found this product pleasant to use the consistency is very good and easy to apply and the scent is not overpowering the moisturizing aspect of the cream is fair , after repeated applications it is not a silver bullet however i was not impressed on first or second use frankly but after a week , of use i did notice some improvement of course everyone will react differently
4	love this color as another reviewer mentioned the polish is a bit thin and watery i used a white coat prior to applying and then 3 coats to get the desired full color it looks great just make sure to use a white base coat and multiple coats to acheive the full color
5	i love this dryer it 's one of the only ones with the lower wattage which allows for my better control i 've been using it for years and am on my third one \( they probably last 2 2 1 2 years on average \)
5	i ordered this for my wife , who is a bit of a makeup snob she really likes this , especially for its nice lines and all day staying power she does feel it travels a bit much , which is her only complaint
5	i have been using revision products for about 10 years and love the brand this cream works well and i am never without it
5	saw this color featured in several magazines , and was happy to see it available here the color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors stunning with grays , jewel tones , and a real pop with black i like essie because it stays on nicely without chipping essie always has the perfect updated colors this color will look great with whatever you wear this winter \( the lace is on \) also bought another 2013 color , vested interest this is a lovely matte color , a greenish gray , that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors love the slightly edgy vibe , but super wearable , and looks fabulous on short nails
4	i have several tattoos and sometimes i have an event where i do not want to show them off , so i use dermablend to cover them up this is a very thick makeup , so it really covers and blends very well i would have preferred a lighter color , because i am very fair , but this color works when blended and covered with a powder perfect for special occasions when i want to look more elegant it also is great for covering up moles and freckles
5	this is the most nearly completely unscented lotion i 've ever used i will be using this for work in the medical field where we do n't allow scents because of patients who are sensitive to them it is slightly greasy but that 's a small price to pay for the great moisturizing and skin protection i will be buying this product
4	color great , too pricey
5	i 've been a fan of st tropez for many years i 've used just about every version they sell , and many they do n't even make any more when you 're trying to get an even color on your body , the foam tanners are the way to go everything else \( sprays , lotions , wipes , etc \) feels just impossible to not end up with streaks at least somewhere on your body but to get the perfect non streak color with these foam formulas , i high recommend one of the foam application mitts there 's just something about how they work with the foam that helps blend everything evenly what i like about this formula is that you can adjust the depth of your tan by how long you leave it on when you have a very fair skin tone \( like myself \) and then one day you show up somewhere with a dark tan , people realize you probably used a bottled product to get your color so i like going gradual but again , i'm not a huge fan of the lotion formulas so this bronzing foam version is a great solution i can wash it off after an hour and the next day i have just a little bit of color then when it 's time to reapply a few days later for touch ups , i can leave it on a little longer and get a little darker color just as important as the applicator mitt \( not something that comes with this tanner , it 's sold separately \) is exfoliating before application i know , it 's a pain to go through these extra steps but if you exfoliate before applying your tanner , it makes all the difference in the world your tan 's color comes out much more even , and it does n't end up patchy as your tan starts to fade and you exfoliate taking these extra few steps is very much with it
1	i was so excited to have received this mascara after reading over all the great reviews however , my experience was anything but exciting i have used many brands of mascara in my lifetime , but none quite like this the first day i applied the mascara it looked like i had put nothing on my lashes the texture of the mascara was like water not sure if this is normal for this mascara or not no thickness and no lengthening to my lashes whatsoever i waited a few minutes to apply a second coat still no difference my blonde lashes looked ever so slightly darker that 's it my lashes were still as short and sparse as ever that night my eyes were a bit red but it had been a long day did n't think much about it i thought i would use one more day and pick up a new brand the following day not like i had a lot of time to be looking for a new brand of mascara again especially after i thought i had done my research day two my eyes began and i could not wait to remove this mascara ! went to bed the following morning both eyes were red , while my right eye was red , swollen , and visibly irritated absolutely not the result i expected \(
4	i can easily say the the zwilling j a henckels rotary ear and nose hair trimmer is the best thing out there i have tried the battery powered , automatic trimmers for grooming and they have all been hard to use and most of them end up pulling out hairs and causing pain the zwilling is perfect in it 's small size and basic operation it might take a minute or two more to get the job done , but it is well worth it the twin s nail clipper that is included in this set is great because of its compact design , the blades are very sharp so they can cut through the thickest nails , but i would make sure to have a file handy because it will leave sharp edges the only thing that would make these clippers perfect is if they had a lock to keep them closed so you could attach the to a key ring or something else to keep them close when you need them while both of these products are great in their simplicity and functions , i do not see why anyone in their right mind would spend 99 on these items i know that zwilling makes phenomenal products especially when it comes to grooming , but there is nothing here to justify such a high price tag i highly reccomend these products , but i do not recommend that anyone pay such an outrageous price for something this basic and simple
5	all to often , i find a skin care product that i really like but the fragrance prevents me from using what otherwise would be a perfect product i am happy to report that this trio from bliss is lightly scented and has truly been providing me a bright face the wash is gentle and foamy enough for me and the moisturizer is thick enough that a small dab will do and it feels great when gently massaged into the face i have used the incredi peel in the past with good results , so that was the for my getting this set at the suggestion of the sales person , i cut the pads in half and place the second half in a size plastic bag for later use this set is a terrific value and good opportunity to try bliss skin care if you have n't already , try their hand creams for relief
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
3	i hate to be the voice of with a product so many people clearly love , but i have two problems with it 1 the scent is strong and vaguely masculine and triggered a migraine for me i figured the scent would disappear as the day went on , but it did n't 2 it weighed down my hair i used a dime sized amount in my long hair yesterday , then tried again today with even less of it , and none on top both days , i felt like my hair looked particularly flat it does help with frizz and it made it a little easier to comb through i guess my hair is the wrong texture for this stuff
5	this product works great i have oily skin and it dries them up
5	i just used this stuff i took a steamy shower , washed my face and then followed the instructions stating to get the cotton ball really wet when applying silver powder then i laid flat and let it dry next i used a pore strip and as i pulled it off , i literally did not have a black head in sight i have battled blackheads my entire teenage and adult life this product is incredible i seriously cried i am going to use it weekly and can afford to do so , it 's a reasonable price try this if your blackheads give you grief
5	love this ! love all his products watch youtube if you want to hear in depth reviews
4	i have purchased 3 of this product as a gift to my friends delivery was fast and the scent was great ! after a week i repurchased another bottle for myself
5	for many years i have been in search of a quality , compact grooming kit over the years i have had kits given to me as gifts , and have purchased kits myself , but all have been the typical chinese junk one finds at the local discount stores for a long time i have had to settle for nice nail clippers made in japan , which i really like , but i have still the nice matched set i 've wanted so when i received the opportunity to review the zwilling j a henckels grooming set i got very excited the set arrived in today 's mail and was perfect timing as my nails have very much been in need of a trim , and i have been waiting for the set to arrive first off , this is not just over priced junk this is a very precision engineered grooming set manufactured by the same company known for its premium knives this grooming set falls in that same category of quality craftsmanship where you get what you pay for so before at the price keep in mind you are paying for very high quality the set arrives in a nice box for gifting , and the grooming tools are neatly in a stylish , thick leather case with a zipper closure there are only 5 tools in the set , but the case is overly large and has extra slots in it that lead me to believe it was designed to hold additional tools \( a comb and or razor , perhaps \? \) each tool has its own slot with the longer file and cuticle pusher needing to be kept at the edges of the case or it wo n't close the case is a bit bulky for this grooming set , but the leather is very nice and no doubt contributes to some of the high cost of this set the nail clippers are very unique and frustrated me at first unlike other clippers , these are designed to fold completely flat for storage and arrive that way to open them you must gently pull back on the top half of the clipper \( there is a small area on it to give you a surface to pull it with \) which allows the two pieces to separate a little bit this is where i got initially frustrated as the tool will not clip or work properly without taking the additional step of lifting the back end of the upper clipper upward and then pushing it forward to lock it into a clipping position i do n't know if the one i received had a stuck spring or if i just did n't use it correctly at first , but once i figured it out i had no problems using the clipper the manufacturer really should provide a little instruction sheet with this set as i have no doubt many have been frustrated thinking the clipper was useless from not knowing how to open it correctly the clippers are so lightweight and feeling that i was afraid they might break easily , but i quickly found that very little force is needed for them to precisely cut my nails and when i say cut , i mean cut these have very precise and sharp edges that cut the nail off with absolutely no edges or tearing like ordinary clippers even the fine japanese nail clippers i own do not cut this easily and precisely after clipping my nails i found little need for usage of the nail file , although the file in this kit is equally nice and works great the scissors in this kit are also remarkable in their precision and sharpness the rounded tip makes them very safe for trimming eyebrows , nose hairs , and hair that always seems to grow out of men 's ears as we get older there is nothing particularly special about the cuticle pusher nail cleaner or tweezers they have the same look and feel as the other tools in the set , but for my purposes wo n't see that much use in a perfect world , for the cost involved , it seems like a small stainless steel comb should have been included in this set overall , this is a very fine grooming set i would say this is what i have had in mind in my years of searching for a quality set the cost of this set will not be appealing or likely appropriate for many men , but for the man who appreciates quality and wants a nice grooming set to stay well groomed this zwilling j a henckels grooming set is definitely worth its cost
5	this sunscreen has zinc oxide for its active ingredient this is an effective sun blocking material i have found that the sunscreen is at least somewhat water resistant the middle of winter is not the best time to test a sunscreen however , i am going skiing in a few weeks so , i will know for sure how well it works to its credit , the tube is three ounces , meaning that i can take it with me on an airplane
5	i'm not big on wearing a lot of creams and moisturizers , but this stuff goes on smooth and is hardly noticeable i'm at the point where a little extra moisturizing around the eyes is a good idea with vichy aqualia thermal eye balm it glides on smoothly and is hardly noticeable i can feel a slight tingly hint of moisture , but it is not greasy the scent is very faint and fades almost immediately this is great for a light smooth touch of moisture
5	great product !
5	i have never used a polish remover that compares anywhere close to this ! i had 5 coats of polish on my nails and all 10 nails were completely clean in less than one minute , with no residue or stains no mess , either it just gets rid of all traces of polish in seconds flat definitely buying more of this ! !
1	at first this was great heated up nicely and made great curls but less than a month later , it does n't heat up well at all i thought i accidentally changed the temp setting but it was on the highest setting and does n't do a thing too late to return it , i wasted 30 bucks do n't make the same mistake i did !
4	i started to notice a difference in two weeks i have sensitive fair skin and there was some peeling from about the third day to the day after that it was fine i did n't break out , experience any discomfort , or rash the obagi is unscented , which , for someone like me who really dislikes heavy chemical or floral fragrances , is a real plus a little goes a long way , only use about a pearl sized drop i 've never used prescription retinol , but for me this worked well
5	simply one of the best products that my wife , it was easy to apply and did n't cause any irritation it 's spreads out properly and the colour looks wonderful
1	deep red peels too easily
5	awesome product fast shipping thank you ! ! !
5	excellent product hair is much softer
4	i'm one who loves peppermint toothpastes , although not the gel formulas marvis classic strong mint toothpaste has a clean , smooth taste and delivers a fresh experience i 've not used it long enough to report on its efficacy , but i think it will be a nice alternative to those toothpastes on your grocery store shelves
4	i 've been using this daily for 3 weeks the first time i applied it i used it like my other moisturizer , but found that when using a larger amount the fragrance was too much so my next application was in tiny dots on cheeks , chin , above lip and temples lightly smoothed with fingertips and that lightened the smell so that it did n't bother me ahava is non greasy and dries soft to the touch i like it because it contains dead sea minerals
5	love , love , love this color ! essie is always great ! the bottle was actually a little bigger than i expected i got a lot of nail polish for my money will be buying essie products again and again !
3	i have long , naturally curly hair that tends to dry out on the ends i got okay results from this product but not impressive results the results were n't anything better than my average conditioner leaves my hair the scent is pleasant enough and not too strong or overpowering it is thick and does n't take a lot to coat my hair entirely i like that it is not greasy and rinses out well the best it worked for me was when i applied it on my dry combed out hair and covered my hair for 20 minutes before shampooing and then i used just a little bit again after shampooing and combed it through and left it on about 5 minutes more my hair was softer when i used it that way
4	3 5 starts first thing that hits you is the strong fragrance of this cream i wish it was not so scented the packaging is also a bit confusing you unscrew the jar top but then there 's a flat top you need to remove the tiny plastic plug that covers the small hole before the pump can dispense any cream so far , cream goes on smoothly without feeling too greasy it 's absorbed quickly on the skin this feels good around the eyes and forehead it 's really too early to tell if this cream will work to improve my lines and skin elasticity , which is my main reason for trying this treatment update finished after 3 5 months of use , i have to admit my skin feels slightly better , a little softer and plumper there seems to be a slow effect that i do n't normally see with other standard face creams i would not go so far as to say it 's firming up it is a slight improvement though i imagine you have to use this consistently for at least 6 months to see real , long lasting effect i'm put off by the false packaging i took the jar apart at the end of the 3 jar , the cream is only in about 1 2 of space the rest is nothing but empty space packaging it 's common in the cosmetic industry but still very annoying to see such a big gap of nothing in the jar
5	great
2	the active ingredient in this product is benzoyl peroxide the same benzoyl peroxide that i 've been using for 40 years the same benzoyl peroxide that you can find on any drug store shelf for around 5 10 so what makes this product worth \? nothing this is a light lotion that goes on very smoothly , but it is shiny it 's not greasy but it shines , shines , shines i used it at bedtime and when i woke up , i had a face full of clogged pores not pimples or an inflammatory response , but something squeezable i was so shocked and very annoyed was n't about to use it again for a great \( and more affordable \) acne treatment , i recommend nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href la roche posay effaclar duo dual action acne treatment cream with benzoyl peroxide oil free 1 35 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 la roche posay effaclar duo dual action acne treatment cream with benzoyl peroxide , oil free , 1 35 fl oz a not only does it contain benzoyl peroxide , but it also has micro exfoliating lha hydroxy acid for me , this cleared my skin of every blackhead , something no over product has ever done at my last visit , my dermatologist even , you do n't have a single blackhead !
4	this lays onto your skin like calamine lotion , it 's very visible it is somewhat strong smelling as well it does seem to dry out and remove acne overnight though
1	i paint my nails very often so i'm very disappointed to find that this has formaldehyde in it i prefer not to repeatedly use products that contain it given the well established negative health effects so this will probably end up in the bin i 've had great luck with 's nail strengthening products which are non toxic so i think i 'll be sticking with those it 's a shame though , i had really high hopes for this !
3	at first i was impressed how effortlessly it was to spread on my face and throat it only took two pumps and my skin absorbed it instantly leaving it feeling smooth and soft no greasy or shiny residue left behind it does have a nice fragrance that quickly disappears however i noticed some strange results immediately after the first there was dry flaky skin around my nostrils and over old blemishes also i had lots of new whiteheads i thought maybe it was a fluke , so i decided to keep using the cream anyways and kept getting the same results i have used products with vitamin c and never had any type of negative reaction something used in this formula just does n't agree with me now i have stopped using it and my face has cleared up and the dry patches are gone
3	pro high quality set with nice leather holder \( which i think may cost more than the set \) the retractable nail is very nicely designed and cuts very sharp and clean the tweezer is small enough to reach corners con the diamond coated is too short and coarse and could n't file the nails smooth kit priced too high
5	does not shout look at my toes like so many of the contemporary colors this old fashioned color is not available in local stores i love it not too pink , not too red just right
5	i love it
5	a little less hard paste than most so goes on easy and everything is gentle no irritation with this
5	my beautiful enamel ! ! ! !
3	this product takes some time everyday if you are not retired or have children that do not give you time for yourself , i would not recommend this item i have been in the sun most of my life and now that i'm fifty i have time for myself i think its helping but it takes time and requires using it on a regular basis this is not an instant fix just keep that in mind
4	the product works really well so far noticed my razor burn and bumps have improved i put it on right after shaving and then use the jack black daily moisturizer a little bit afterwards the only thing i do n't like about the gel is that it is a little bit thick and feels somewhat sticky on both my hands and face for a bit after application
3	this styling cream is okay but it caused my hair to flake which is n't okay
5	so i have tried this product before and have always loved it i it bought from the amazon site because i found it at a much cheaper price than i would normally buy it thanks for offering this great product at a great price !
5	pca products are great
4	this is a bit pricey for 1 oz of moisturizer and does feel like its making the skin smoother , it is light , not oily , and felt nicely hydrating under foundation in my drying work environment it also was fine to put on my skin at night it comes out blue , which i was n't crazy about , but does n't add any visible tint to the skin it is smoothing , but you can feel it on your skin if you rub it moisturizes nicely overall
5	this color is so pretty ! ! ! i saw it on pinterest and had to get it ! i is pretty light so i have to put on about 3 coats to get my ideal color , but i usually put on 2 coats of any color anyway just to get good coverage
5	shipped on time , item exactly as described i love this color on my nails perfect summer color to wear also love the shimmer
4	it 's slim and sharp , easy to hold and use i ordered the blonde color , but it really is a little dark i just apply it with a lighter hand i would buy again
3	the peony color of this gloss is a very light pink cotton candy shade of pink \( i'm still looking for someone to re create the wonderful rosy baby pink of the ud lipgloss shade loved that \) this gloss is sticky , and the is n't quite the right shape to keep the gloss from piling up on the edge of lips it also seems to be intended to be worn solo , and usually i apply lipstick and then lip gloss my light beige lipsticks seem to work best under this gloss \( which is too light pink for me to wear solo \)
4	this is very easy to apply , albeit a bit dry for me \( need extra moisturizer afterwards \) , but that is me and my winter dry skin extra plus no scent that i can detect i have been applying it twice daily for about a week and have noticed a bit less redness , which is a blessing it has n't taken care of it all , but any little bit less red is more than welcome to me
5	wow factor love the texture and ever so subtle sparkle in it super moisturizing just make sure you pick the right color
5	quick to ship , the item was received as described love this product ! will buy from again in the future thank you for a smooth transaction
5	i 'd been looking for a scented candle with some serious fragrance heft a great throw to really add to my whole \( small \) house this does the trick it burns cleanly and has a clean , crisp scent there are light floral overtones but champagne would not be far off the candle comes in a hefty presentation box that i 'd be proud to give as a gift for a shower or event the glass container , usually a throw away in items like this , is really special i very much want to keep it for household use after the candle is done pretty with an artisan flair i want to add a note the instructions say to burn the candle to the edge the first time you light it as that will afford a smooth burn all the way down the estimated time to get to that stage was given as 2 3 hours i have had this candle burning for 5 hours and cannot get that full burn it does n't diminish the candle for me but i did want to point that out lovely product for home or gift
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	awesome product ! i 've been using it for 20 years
5	from the wife nice and smooth texture initially , it seems heavy for a tinted moisturizer , but it spreads smoothly and gives a light coverage it is moisturizing but i do have dry skin , so i put my day moisturizer on first and put the tinted moisturizer over it the concealer provides great coverage for my dark under eye circle with the use of a concealer brush i was able to put it on smoothly the nice , compact packaging is efficient to take with you when you 're traveling or keeping it in your purse i love the quality of this product , after using it several times i got to appreciate it more it gives a fresh look all day it feels light on the skin and it specially great now during the summer months if you are looking into higher end cosmetic , vincent longo is a trusted name and this tinted moisturizer lives up to that
5	i have always had oily skin , so i have to be careful about moisturizers they can so easily make my skin look shiny even with the best products , i generally have to use a gel like the one by mac a couple of times throughout the day to dull the shine on my nose and forehead , so shine is something i know a little about the first day i used this baxter moisturizer my skin looked nice and shine free immediately afterwards , but the best part was when i went in the bathroom at lunch to apply some gel to my face i discovered that i was n't shiny ! that rarely happens , but each day that i used the baxter , my skin made it all the way to the end of the workday before i had to apply the mac gel honestly , i had my doubts about it at first because it seems a little heavy coming out of the tube , but once i started to work it into my skin i discovered that it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling well hydrated and soft i had never heard of baxter until recently , but now i use their mint hair conditioner too and i absolutely love it so , guess i'm becoming a believer in baxter products ! ps it always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful if you 'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment i usually respond the same day , so if you have a question or comment \( even if it 's just to say , hi ! \) feel free to post it below thanks ,
4	good product
5	using the powers of essential oils to protect and heal skin it is an amazing product the scent is very strong , as anything with essential oils in it usually is , but it does fade pretty quickly and i did n't find it overpowering my skin was well moisturized and firm after a week of using this my skin tone seemed more even and my face overall was smooth i really love this cream and can see myself using this from now on this container will last about 2 3 months of nightly use for me i am 31 , with normal skin
5	good conditioner , works good in my curly hair , plumps it up a little bit with volume too smells nice , and leaves no residue
3	have used many frizz control and smoothing products , and this color wow did not wow me it was ok , but at this price \? have bleached hair that can get really poofy when it is humid , and this product helped but i ca n't really say it did a much better job than the products and serums i 've used that half the price on the other hand , my boyfriend , who has a long goatee growing \( think that guy from \) , really liked how it turned his coarse hairs silky smooth
3	during the warmer months of the year , my skin is pretty moist but winter is an entirely different story , especially after i hit 30 specifically , between my brows and on my forehead , my skin is so dry it feels like leather so i was excited to try a product that would hopefully restore some of that missing moisture as the product recommended , i applied it once in the morning and once before bed you could see the results immediately , but unfortunately they did n't last as soon as i woke up in the morning , my skin would be dry and leathery again i 've used it several times but that has sadly been my result each time i probably should n't expect a miracle though , as it did restore moisture to my skin right after i used it it did n't really lock in moisture as i had hoped though one plus i have acne prone skin and this did n't really trigger my acne or make it worse , so that 's a good thing !
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	love this color , goes with a lot of different clothes
4	after about three weeks of daily use , i can honestly tell you that this serum has made a difference you ca n't normally say that cosmetic products i 've found most creams feel good going on , but do n't do a heck of a lot the strivectin brand actually produces results granted , these results are minor , but they are i 've tried some other strivectin products also to good effect my wife recently lost some weight , and the skin of her neck developed some fine lines after using the strivectin tightening neck serum roller , the lines have visibly lessened her neck skin seems smoother and plumper , and the lines wrinkles are no longer quite so apparent it does not get rid of them completely and deeper lines are still there , but they too seem to be diminished to use , pop off the top and turn the roller head 180 to on the serum will then flow when rolling the scent of this neck serum is pleasant and very mild , and the roller applicator feels good when applied i 've found that getting initial coverage and then turning off the feed and just using the roller to smooth things in , is the best way to spread the serum around without overdoing it it causes no irritation and soaks into the skin quickly the fact that there are noticeable results when using the strivectin tightening neck serum roller is more than enough for me to recommend it i wish it did n't a premium price , but you pay for what you get kort
5	gosh , this is a very sexy , soft scent my husband is wearing it today and he loves it it smells so soft and sexy and clean it 's not overpowering my husband gets a headache from strong , floral or sweet scents every year , i go and try to find him a new scent and i always tell the person at the store , i'm looking for a soft , sorta powdery , clean scent this one i would have bought my husband if i smelled it in a store the bottle is very sleek looking too i actually wear my husbands colognes sometimes and for the past 2 hours i have it on and i love the way it smells on me i think i 'll wear it tomorrow to work it 's a great scent all i can say is if you like a lighter , powdery , clean scent this is it there are no florals and i do n't smell any citrus or salt
4	after 3 weeks of daily use , my girlfriend 's face does seem to look a bit more toned and vibrant but the results are not that dramatic considering the price
4	this is a good product basically first you apply a light layer of powder over your face , then set it with the spray the feeling is less heavy than i expected , and my makeup lasted all night without wearing off \( except for lipstick \) i'm taking off one star , because it does require one extra step \( applying powder \) compared to other makeup setting sprays i have tried
2	it was not the color shown nor what i expected its a brown gray
5	best price around , beats the mall
4	this is a review of dermablend full coverage foundation makeup in shade natural beige this foundation is quite creamy and just a little was needed for moderate to full coverage this foundation is buildable , however , i noticed that on my nose and cheek bone areas , it appeared very splotchy and cakey and i could not correct this \( the description claims it is not \) i love that the spf is so high \( 30 \) to help to reduce sun damage i took one star off because it claims to be smudge proof and transfer resistant , yet a gentle blow of my nose in a tissue , or a light touch on my face takes this product off \( even when using a primer and when set with powder \) i added 1 picture , untouched , with 2 pictured taken in the same lighting the first picture is after moisturizing my clean face \( zero makeup \) and the second picture is after applying the dermablend foundation \( i used a brush \) i have to say that for the coverage this foundation offers , it is very light and breathable on your skin without too much touching of my face , it did last most of the day i noticed it wore off of my nose and chin more than anywhere else i am not sure if this product conceals scars , , birthmarks , burns , etc as it claims since i do n't have those to cover it did even out my skin tone , reduce redness , and cover up some of my blemishes overall pleased with the product but not sure how well it will work for those with more significant skin issues
2	okay , this clipper is for nails on your finger it does not work on toenails when you try pressing the clipper , it does not cut the toenail i am disappointed do n't tell me that my toenails are tough to break i have cheap clipper , from dollar store , that works on both finger nails and toenails come on have you tested your product on toenails \?
3	i have been on a quest for my perfect shampoo and conditioner i bought this set with high hopes unfortunately , they did not work for me i have long , blonde , thick , dry ish hair but this combo made it downright oily and limp i also did not like the scent i do n't normally worry too much about shampoo conditioner fragrance , but this stuff is really strong smelling the conditioner , however , was a bit better than the shampoo in total fairness , i used these products for 2 months but finally threw away the remaining product and replaced with biolage hydrating formula which works much better for me
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
5	lovely fragrance , kind of heavy and sticks around after you apply it seems like the perfect thing though for winter ! update i have been using every day since i got it it keeps my makeup on , as a user on my face so use a little bit on my neck or my age is starting to show it really seems to help my neck \) you may consider this an issue , or you may not , but you can still feel this moisturizer on the next morning it has not any breakouts for any negative side at all for something at last this long , that 's a miracle !
5	love this color it 's a nice champagne y shimmery color
3	i purchased the blackest black liner and it 's just what i needed it lives in my purse and just a quick swipe gives me beautiful results as a dark and black line on my eyelids it does not fade during the day , especially if applied over eye primer , but even without it works well and stays put all day it 's like drawing with a crayon only better as it 's made of gel and so it 's lightweight and has staying power and does not pull on the eyes something i hate about pencil and pen liners as they pull too much not this one it 's great for the waterline too as the liquids can get inside the eye however , applied on the waterline it can smudge a bit during the day and needs a cotton or tissue wipe occasionally so it does not spread under the eye it works better than liquid in a hurry as it 's faster and easier to produce a sharp line for those who like really thin lines , it might still be better to go with liquid or a sharp pen type liner as this pencil produces slightly thicker lines , but they 're really smooth the color is consistent and pigmented , unlike some other liners it also smudges less than urban decay liners for me the only negative is as it gets used it can get thicker and does not produce a crisp line as it does when it 's pointy so i have to shave off the tip a bit to give the same result i wish it was a self sharpening type as it does not sharpen well and tends to break sometimes that is why i reduced a star it 's still a great product update reducing another star as it 's impossible to sharpen this pencil ! after using it a few times the tip disappeared and the pencil does not sharpen with the 2 3 different sharpeners that i tried finally figured out that you have to press really hard to sharpen , but does not sharpen to the same type of point and makes a thicker smudged line however , i bought another one as i do need to use pencil when i am in a hurry , i am now trying to find the perfect eyeliner pen there are some nice ones available at sephora
5	my acne has mostly been cured but sometimes , as an adult does this ever end \? this is a nice to have overnight treatment i loved the fact the applicator has an aluminum tip so much easier to keep bacteria cleaned off this way if you apply this vichy targeted treatment exactly where you need it , you will get results in about 20 hours i had three not terrible patches , and they were greatly reduced by the next day , after one treatment i used after a shower and applied to problem areas less , no painful stinging , just effective redness and acne resolved small tube can go with you in your bag
4	nice colour , love it
5	a truly wonderful product for a mega watt smile works best with the accelerator whitens my too my natural teeth match my
4	nice lightweight hand cream for the summer
1	very matted color , peels too easily
3	while it is medium coverage it does not seem to actually cover blemishes as i layered some of the red from my chin acne faded but did n't disappear it seems to cake in my pores and looked heavy it is easy to apply , start with finger application and blend with a sponge it is smooth , easy to blend , and feels good , not sticky while it does a good job , it does n't cover birthmarks , redness from acne , or tattoos but it does a good job at masking them just a bit so they are not
4	this cleanser is working very well for me , outside of the first time when i had a few happen , i'm guessing it came from a couple of pores since it has n't happened since the first use i do n't pick up on any strong fragrance \( a plus for me \) and it cleans what little makeup i do wear with no irritations to my irritable skin this is also a very generous size bottle of cleanser , much larger than i expected my only complaint is the condition the dispenser was in when it arrived , and it is possible i broke it when trying to break open the heavy bubble wrap and heavy tape it arrived in when i got it all open , the very top part of the dispenser was loose from the rest , and while i was able to get it back into the dispenser and use it , it does n't connect solidly and is easy when grabbing the bottle again , it could have been myself who did it , as i did n't it closely through the bubble wrap , but it is the first time this has happened with any products with this kind of dispenser unit still , i'm very happy with how it 's working on my skin and wo n't be switching back to my old standby anytime soon
5	i have some dermablend that is a bit too dark , but love it even though i have to blend it with a lighter foundation this color pretty much matches my skin i do n't wear a lot of foundation , but this one seems to stay on well , blends well with my skin and covers my broken veins and redness on my cheeks i do use a primer to close my pores on my nose and that works with minimizing the pores and the foundation sinking into them i also use powder to set the foundation with my tube of too dark dermablend i used it as a contouring cream and i must admit that combined with this full coverage foundation it is a really good look !
5	i was n't sure about this candle i'm usually not a big fan of patchouli , but it does n't overwhelm the other notes it 's a good size i burned it for the first time for about four hours i barely melted an inch i enjoyed the fragrance it did n't knock you down , but was pleasantly there i think this is a quality candle that will last a long time
5	very nice product , particularly for dry
5	i loved this bright shade a lot so much that i bought two ! i am african american but i think it will work for many skin tones it 's great !
3	my wife had an allergic reaction to it and could not complete the tube i would not recommend if you are prone to rash or have sensitive skin
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	i used to be really impressed with this stuff when i first bought it , but the longer i 've had it and as it begins to change to a more dry consistency i do n't think it 's giving me the same results i wo n't be repurchasing this and plan on trying their drying lotion when i finish this product visit my blog at christinaschiccorner com to read my more detailed review i wrote about it in my skincare routine post
1	i normally love this curling iron , this one must be defective , it does not clamp shut , so therefore it does not curl properly waste of money
5	great color if you are fond of the new green colors shipment fast and i am satisfied with this seller
4	love this production , but sometimes it comes out a bit , even with the fiberhold spray definitely would recommend it for anyone with thin thinning hair
4	i liked this tanner it smells amazing , first of all second of all , it is very easy to apply i received a sample of the tanner with an application mitt and that is the way to go i showered , exfoliated and then applied the tanner i made sure to go sparingly on my elbows , knees and ankles i am slightly tan already from a summer spent mostly outdoors and this helped to even out my color and to deepen the tan i already had i would definitely recommend this self tanner
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	got rid of my dry red spots immediately i love avene
3	perfumes scents in products are an issue for me , especially scents are that flowery and scent levels that others think are perfectly fine and way too strong for me and some scents are fine so i just have to try products to see which ones work for me and which ones do n't unfortunately the scent of this hand cream comes on too perfumey for me however , that does not mean it is objectively too perfumey i had a co worker try it and she liked the fragrance and did n't think it was too strong so if you are n't normally bothered by fragrance in a product , this should be fine for you but if you have scent sensitivities , be careful i also think it is a bit flowery for men but i did n't try it on any of my male co workers when i was n't fussing over the fragrance , i thought it was a fine hand cream but because of the scent , i prefer nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href hand repair cream 2 ounces dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 hand repair cream 2 ounces a , which is an excellent hand cream
5	update after having this for a few weeks , my wife has mentioned several times how much she loves the scent smell is a subjective thing but my wife and i both enjoy this scent it 's very mild and does not overpower the scent easily lasts for several hours if you spray it into the air and then walk through it or spray it on your wrists and then rub them together the packaging is very attractive and makes this a splendid gift for a loved one the bottle and lid are unique and substantial it definitely makes an impression and lets you know you 've got something special
3	the serum is light and absorbs quickly , the scent to me is too strong , it lingers in my nostrils too long i do n't understand why companies insist on making facial products perfume scented , it is really a turn off and i have quit using so many products because of the scents the dropper is ok , at least it gives a consistent amount into you hand so you are n't wasting it i did n't experience any burning or irritation but i am used to using serums with , creams hyaluronic acid of all kinds i have not seen any difference in my wrinkles and lines or my pores as yet and it is not moisturizing so you need to use a moisturizer with it i will post back if i see any positive results on my skin but so far i have seen nothing change
3	on the plus side this mascara goes on neatly , does n't clump and has good staying power it 's also fairly easy to remove however it does n't seem to thicken or lengthen my lashes at all there is nothing dramatic about this mascara i would n't consider switching to this from any drugstore brand
4	i got the crepe erase ultra hydrating body lotion to help with the skin on my arms that is thinning and is no longer as resilient as it used to be ah , the of aging this lotion is designed to hydrate the skin and plump it it so it looks more youthful and healthy it was designed to be used with crepe erase intensive body treatment but i did not buy the cream as it was quite expensive so , the body lotion was left to do the job on its own the lotion is light feeling when you put it on and absorbs fairly quickly i like that quality because i do n't like waiting around for something to dry before i can get dressed i do n't have a ton of time to waste that way i applied the lotion every day in the morning for almost a month by the end of the first week , i could see a difference in the texture of the skin on my arms it was getting smoother and the fine wrinkles were not as apparent i kept using it for the better part of month and i was pleased with the results my only complaint was the scent of the lotion i usually try to get cosmetics and skin care products with no perfume in them as i have very sensitive skin as a result , i did not use this lotion on my face that was only asking for trouble and i did n't need that the lotion was fine using it only on my arms i like the product and recommend it for help with taming those signs your aging skin needs attention
3	not exactly the shade i thought it would be as i wanted more orange and it leans to the pink side but the polish is a good product
4	i am a licensed esthetician and i like to use image peel products their products come in plastic tubes and my personal preference is to use professional products that are packaged in dark brown glass bottles this company is located in florida and it is run by a husband and wife team she is an esthetician and he is a plastic surgeon my experience with the product like is mixed i used products on myself and i have combination oily skin some products from this line make my skin even more oily this particular line is geared toward problem skin \( acne \) mask contains the following ingredients glycolic acid and salicylic acid are effective agents for combating acne sulfur which soothes inflammation and painful lesions , and it works to calm red , irritated skin hyaluronic acid hydrates the skin , so it doesnt become dry while lesions are being dried and reduced kaolin helps to decrease the amount of oil on the skin extract is antibacterial , and it serves to keep acne from returning peppermint leaf helps to counteract redness , and rosemary works to heal lesions and restore skin that has damage i use the mask during occasional that i experience in a summer time during exercise and sweating when pores tend to clog more easily product is effective this mask comes in a large quantity and it can last for a really long time even if it is used several times a week i used it on cleansed and tones skin , typically after i scrubbed my face with exfoliant i apply mask and let it sit on my face mask helps with removing excess oil
1	came inside a plastic bag with half the bottle spilled everywhere and the box came wet my rose water and cucumber water ugh next time im not buying this online anymore the kids were n't even full screwed on i ordered rose water , cucumber water , glycolic toner and orange cleansing soap and 3 out of 4 bottles cake leaking horrible only the orange cleansing soap did n't leak because its formula
5	one of my favorite colors even though it 's not one of those iridescent colors that is made to change colors , it looks pink in some light a s coral in others not too baby pastel light , and not too dark just right
5	this is one of the best skin cremes i have ever used yes , it is expensive but this is one of the times i can honestly say you get what you pay for a little goes a long way , this should last you for months , so it is well worth it goes on rich and luxurious , absorbs super quick into your skin i use it immediately after i shower to lock in moisture and i can say for the few months i have been using it now , my skin looks and feels fresher and softer i love the fragrance and the way it applies i can highly recommend this is creme to anyone with 40 skin minimizes wrinkles , adds moisture back to aging skin and makes your skin glow and feel wonderful takes years off your face !
1	break out from hell worse than a hormonal teenager !
5	great product i like it great product i like it great product i like it great product i like it but i do not like having to write extra words on this post !
4	i tried this moisturizer on my face it feels very light and it goes on pretty smoothly leaving my skin feeling soft without feeling greasy having said that , i personally am not too fond of the green apple scent especially on my face i do like the idea that it 's organic and and according to the package , it has an antioxidant rich juice base i would consider this moisturizer either unscented or with a different or more subtle scent regardless , i think it 's a good product
4	this is a nice light feeling eye complex that penetrates quickly and does n't leave any sticky or greasy feeling you can apply after your morning shower and then apply your make up once it 's completely absorbed i also applied after washing my face in the evening which gave me slightly better results if you 're just beginning to notice fine lines this is a good eye treatment another lotion or cream needs to be applied to the rest of your face bottle is larger than what 's actually inside there 's a false bottom inside the bottle
5	great product , great price , fast shipping !
2	not for flat iron protection my hair smelled burned all day and when it got wet that night in shower i will use it up as shine spray only too for shine spray
5	leaves my face sparkling clean but soft
5	another great neutral from essie ! more of a brown tone for that boho vibe !
4	this product has a pleasant , authentic jasmine scent it smells medium strong upon application but after about an hour , i can barely smell it at all it is moisturizing without being too oily and it instantly absorbed into my skin i usually avoid butters because they can leave a sticky texture on my skin not so with this product it 's not quite heavy enough for use on rough elbows and heels , but that 's not really an issue for me since i use bha products on those body parts overall , it 's a very nice light balm with an amazing scent i'm pretty sure it 's not worth 29 \( i 'd be happier if it was in the 15 range \) , but it is a nice product and would make a great gift for people who love jasmine
5	wonderful color , true to photo !
3	this is gentle , but a lot thinner than i expected , making it easy to waste a lot per use , which , given the price tag , is less than ideal it has two ingredients , that separate when still , so must be shaken before use i used a soaked cotton ball and it did take off my waterproof mascara pretty cleanly , though it took 2 3 cotton balls to get it all off both eyes , which took a good 1 2 out of the bottle making daily use a fairly pricey given the cost of this most other eye makeup removers i 've tried are oilier , requiring less product per use i will note , though , that it 's quite gentle i wear contacts and did n't take them out before using this , and had no issues i only occasionally wear waterproof mascara or , heck , mascara at all , so this serves my needs fine for occasional use , and does a better job at complete removal than my useful ponds again , my only real issue is the very high price point
2	did not care for the over all results of this product the first thing i noticed was the smell which was quite pleasant so that was a good start application was fairly easy to apply to my skin so good there but once it was all applied it did not give a nice brown tan look it was a more of a medium orange tan which i did not like at all and as time went by it just got worse i thought maybe i applied it wrong but i the instructions a few times and no it was not that maybe it was just my skin pigmentation and the product did not mix but either way it was a bust for me
5	true to color i was afraid it would be some mustard yellow , but it 's a very daisy sort of yellow
5	i had deep concerns about this product how can a product be worth it \? it 's so expensive \? i read 's review , and she indicated that the face cream has fish in it disgusting i anticipated a horrible fishy smell i was totally wrong , and i'm sorry for my negative first off , the product has no smell that i can discern , certainly not a fishy one i would classify the product as unscented second , the cream goes on lightly like air absolutely weightless third , the cream is not oily and not drying it locks in moisture for the whole day \( i did a mini test by applying it to one hand and not the other the next day , the hand with the cream was softer \) i will note that i live in chicago and it is summertime here this product claims to have cell regeneration properties this is how it gets rid of wrinkles on your face honestly , i do n't hate my wrinkles , and i'm not interested in spending large amounts of money to get rid of them i do , however , have a number of areas that would benefit from some skin regeneration i have scars and areas that have gone through surgery and radiation , and am right now going through chemo , which is very damaging to skin frankly , on scarred areas , works a bit , but not really , and costs a small fortune anyway with this product , a little goes a long way you ca n't compare the price to ounce for ounce , because you use a whole lot of , and a very small tiny bit of this i 'll try this product for a few weeks \( on my face and on my scars \) and update this review with my verdict if this product truly has cell regeneration properties , it would be very helpful for skin damaged by surgery , radiation , chemo , medication , climate , and life in general my initial impression of this product is very high , but it will take a few weeks to evaluate its claims
5	this is a thick foundation , i would n't use it unless you had something to cover up if you do , then this is a good foundation it comes with a tiny paddle , but i prefer a sponge if you have age spots or acne , this will do a pretty good job to cover it it blends well , and does n't feel oily , though i have dry skin and could use a little of that ! but anyway , it 's a nice looking foundation and it does the job
5	dermablend offers nice quality cosmetics , this powder camo foundation works very well it 's easy to apply , i have not had any of the dermablend products cause any irritation or breakouts start with a small amount then you can add more as needed i 've found the biggest challenge for me is choosing the right shade color i have a hard time even when standing in front of the item in a store , so if i'm unfamiliar with the shades of a particular product , it 's even harder for me to choose online this shade is slightly darker than what i need \( could have went 1 shade lighter \) , but it may work if i get more of a tan if you 're like me have trouble selecting shades you may want to check the product in stores first to find your perfect color match , then look for the price on amazon \( often times amazon offers a better deal \)
5	better than other spot treatment i have tried acid and peroxide helps my face anytime i have breakouts
3	seems to be genetic in our family my grandmother , and mother had it , and now i do i was looking forward to using this cream as both a daily moisturizer and sunscreen however , i find this cream to be very heavy and dense more like a pancake make up than a sunscreen yes , it covers the red and pink in my cheeks but it is so thick that it also any wrinkles or anywhere on your face , especially around the eyes and mouth not a plus in my book does it do what it says \? cover up spotting and discolored areas on your face \? yes it does and i believe it also acts as a sunscreen but this product may not be for you if you do n't like a heavy , thick makeup
3	love the product the container not so much hard to open with wet hands tried opening it before i got in shower it fell off toilet tank and lost quite a bit
5	great color
3	this was not love at first smell for me , or the second i know everyone 's scent is different and so this is my personal opinion i was n't a huge fan of this , after a few tries , i think it 's okay , but it 's far from a preferred cologne i do n't think it smelled clean or something sexy i do n't know what category to put this in maybe sporty \? my husband owns a boat load of colognes this just is n't something that i am a huge fan of
5	yes , it works in base , colored and top coats when they need to be thinned i have more than 400 polishes so this one is must have for me top coats tend to get gooey easily and this one saves money
4	with most thickening shampoos i expect a bit of tingle to help stimulate the scalp that was missing from this shampoo nice fragrance , cleans hair well but did n't really notice much of a difference in the hair after a week of use after trying aveda 's , this product , billy jealousy and probably some others the aveda gave the looking results and will probably be the one we return to
5	goes on nicely , i would recommend using a topcoat over it color does n't fade but normal chipping happens with use
5	it 's like a medium brown coffee with a little cream i believe it would look great on any skin tone it 's a good color for thin application , no streaking i love cnd ! !
5	great product
5	thanks
4	i will be the first to admit that i am a lip balm lipstick junkie i love lipstick and definitely love lip glosses i have never tried this brand and have never tried a lip enhancer in fact , when i mentioned the lip enhancer to my husband , he as he did n't think i needed any enhancement to my lips i have just started trying this out so i have not noticed any improvement in plumping out my lips but i do like this it does n't sting my lips the color is a nice coral and softer than the lipstick i am trying out by the same brand \( which is just a little too bright pink for my taste \) this glides on nicely and keeps my lips soft for at least an hour \( that 's all the time i noticed it might have lasted longer but i have short attention for different things like make up because i am constantly distracted by different things \) it is a bit pricey for my wallet , but i might consider splurging on this if i see it in my local stores because i do like it i know that i wo n't be having chapped lips as long as i use this enhancer if it does plump up my lips , even better 4 23 14
4	i have n't been using this long , but unfortunately i seem to be one of the people who ca n't really use this without suffering a little the good here is that while i ca n't say that i see any huge difference with my facial contours , i have seen a noticeable difference with my breakouts this seems to have done a number on my splotches , enough to where i'm pretty impressed it did n't completely get rid of them , but the spots are lighter than they would on their own it 's enough that if the con of this was n't so noticeable , i would absolutely be converted the con here is that this gave me headaches this may have been because i was using it at half strength for most of the time , but i 've noticed it when i was using it at the lowest setting the headaches are n't splitting , but they 're there and unfortunately my headaches like to linger i'm trying to debate if i want to continue despite this and limit the usage to only once or twice a week and do only half the routine i really do like the zit effect i'm just unfortunately now one of those people who are a little prone to getting lingering headaches , so this likely wo n't be a problem for people now i'm sure that a big question people will have is does it hurt \? while i could occasionally feel the electricity at half power , it was n't unpleasant at all and as long as the gel is still dry , is are you wo n't feel much of anything it 's more of a tingling feeling than anything else when you do feel it , but i imagine that it will be more noticeable at full blast i 've never had it on full blast since i did n't think it was necessary so the question here is whether or not it 's worth it , as this is an expensive item assuming that my results with acne are standard , it 's definitely something to look at it you have acne that likes to stick around like i do i'm not sure how hygienic it is to share these , otherwise i 'd suggest using a friend 's first to see what you think as far as wrinkles go , i ca n't say much on that since mine are fairly small , but i will try to through the headaches with a less frequent schedule and update
4	rich , creamy , and evenly absorbed , it leaves your skin moisturized without the slightest greasy feeling , pretty near a miracle during this rough maine winter the scent is mild and natural
5	best chapstick expensive though
5	i'm so impressed with this it 's a great bronzer for reference , i'm fair skinned , and tan only slightly golden glow turned out to be a good shade for me it looks like it would be sparkly , but it 's a lot more like a glow pros 1 the bronzer goes on easily and looks great 2 it is a generous size 3 the packaging is very clever , including a brush stored in the case and a mirror on the back cons 1 i wish the mirror was visible on the front side instead of on the back , but it 's not that big of a deal
5	great smell , terrific lather , and so far , it not only made a smooth shave , but left behind clear skin , as promised no ingrown hairs none my only complaint is the label is all foreign language french \? i really do like this shaving cream though it leaves behind a faint but pleasant smell it 's thick from the get go easy to spread easy to shave maintains its lather long enough for you to see what you 're doing
5	i love la roche posay effaclar products i have purchased effaclar duo \( must have ! \) , effaclar anti aging serum , and effaclar k many times i also own the effaclar bb cream because of their good track record , i was excited to try this cleanser i am happy to say and am also not very surprised that i love it it has a thin , smooth , gel consistency and foams up slightly it glides over the skin so easily hard to describe but important to note , as acne prone skin can be further inflamed by more abrasive , exfoliating cleansers even just rubbing too hard with fingers while cleansing can cause additional irritation this foaming gel rinses off very easily , and leaves the skin feeling squeaky clean , but not too taught another big plus is that it does n't sting my eyes at all ! i am always cautious of cleansers stinging my eyes , and can actually lightly rub this over my eyes to remove any eye makeup residue \( i use a separate eye makeup remover before cleansing \) with no fear fyi this cleanser in itself is n't a strong acne fighting product it has zinc to help combat oiliness , but i would consider it a complement to an effective acne fighting regimen \( effaclar duo is my top choice \) this cleanser is also great for people who simply have oily skin
5	my husband has cystic acne and said its the best hes ever used even over prescription meds he uses it 2x a day and his skin looks amazing !
5	be sure to follow the directions it works
5	just another great product from this company does a great job i will follow up with turbo wash and i do n't think i could feel any cleaner or refreshed
5	there is no doubt this clarisonic is expensive but it definitely works overall , i really liked using this product after i used it i tried my regular exfoliate \( the cure from japan \) instead of globs of dead cells hardly anything came off my face very impressive first off , i like that it is completely water proof so you can use in the shower \( note the cord is not water proof \) the handle is charged by attaching a magnetic like curved strip that plugs into an usb or regular outlet and it clips to the handle , so there is no opening on the handle however , the problem with a handle that is self contained is how long is its lifespan \? since it ca n't be opened you ca n't add or replace new batteries the internal battery can also be a hassle if you forget to recharge it since it can take a while to recharge but it does have a battery life indicator which is helpful to tell you how much juice is left the pack also includes 2 brush heads one for the body and the other for the face both are soft and plush on the skin the problem is you will need to buy more it would be nice it they were sold in multi packs for a discounted price ! this clarisonic also has a helpful timer so you can do each zone of your face equally i admit i liked the massage it gives and wanted to do more cycles per zone this is good for preventing you from over exfoliating yourself ! you can also go manual and switch if you prefer , too this model has speed options that can increase ' not sure if that actually works the kit also includes 2 cleaners a gel cleaner and skin polish both are very mild the company states you can use other cleaners but not to use any with exfoliates that not are perfectly round like those that have nut as this will scrape your face another thing about the use of the brush is that it should not be shared since bacteria etc can transfer i am currently using it with my sister but we have our separate brush heads although there are several negatives i really felt the clarisonic worked so well on my face and body that the positives the issues of concern since i often feel my make up removers are n't doing all that they are supposed to this extra insurance gives me piece of mind and feels a little like a fancy spa treatment definitely something to spoil with
4	this concealer helps conceal my acne dark circles and sun spots the various shades in the kit help color correct so the concealer stays transparent under my foundation i ordered fair but actually need a slightly darker shade with my summer tan i would definitely consider buying this kit again i feel like it is quality make up at a reasonable price considering all of the color options in the kit
4	this is not inexpensive , but it 's so nice to see a moisturizing product that men in my house will actually use , that it 's worth it the product got off to a bad start right out of the box it smelled vile however , that was , oddly , from the amazon shipping or something it had been stored near in the opening the tube , the white , a bit more flowing than toothpaste , squeezed out easily and with no unpleasant fragrance \( very little scent at all that i could tell this was good ! \) it made a positive impression from first contact and i heard comments like , it goes on very well , feels good , and i like it one thing that impressed me was that , as promised , there was no shininess or greasiness to the skin it really does go on with a matte finish no one would know you had used a moisturizer at all while getting all the benefits of one good product if not for the price being high , it would be 5 stars but , at least you do get what you pay for
5	love this color
5	this primer goes on as smoothly as a moisturizer , and keeps your makeup fresh looking , longer the package says it nourishes and lifts your face , the kind of claim that always makes me skeptical i doubt that any of us has tried a product for a few weeks and then thought , ah , my face is so well nourished now ! however , a lot of us older women do hesitate to use foundation for fear of looking in the mirror at the end of a busy day and discovering that it has settled into lines , gotten blotchy , or otherwise made us look worse than we would have if we had n't bothered this product solves those problems jouer 's own foundation , the matte moisture tint , goes on much more smoothly and evenly over this primer , and other brands i tried it with perform better if you have moist skin , this primer might take the place of a moisturizer if not , it 's lightweight and does n't with the other products you use
3	the consistency is a little thicker than i like for a face cover i am guessing that it is due to the spf sun protection which is a good thing , but it means i have to thin the product to get the look i want it is also a little lighter than i was expecting for a medium being too light for my face with the remains of a summer tan
5	this color it is the exact shade of my eyelids , and i 've been told repeatedly that my features are enhanced with only having a little on , because women do n't want to show such a great difference when wearing or not wearing makeup i highly recommend it !
5	great product for skin
4	nice full coverage makeup a little darker than i expected \( i was hoping it would be a slightly tanned look , but it is darker than that \) light matte finish which blends nicely with other makeup that i wear had to deduct a star simply because it is too dark for my complexion and i wo n't be able to use it \(
4	good wearability
4	after trying tons of dry shampoos , i received a sample size of this in a birchbox on month , and i was hooked ! some people do n't like the smell , and i love it so i 'll try to explain what it smells like it 's faintly powdery musky , and is only strong when first applied after about five minutes , you really ca n't smell it , and neither can other people \( i asked \) what i love about this dry shampoo is that a little goes a long way , it does n't make your hair feel filmy \( like you 're covering up grease with powdery crap \) , and it really makes you feel almost as fresh as if you 'd washed your hair a great pick me up , and if you 're not ready to take the plunge because it 's pricey , try getting an r co kit so you can try a smaller size along with other products , like their blow out balm happy dry shampooing !
1	olive oil fix tip , well named as it is just that , a small vile of olive oil , 12 plastic disposable wands , with a sticker on the wands that state made in china ! you could probably do much better in a dollar store , as you could get a zillion plastic makeup wands for a dollar also a small vile from a pack of 100 , fill the small vile with olive oil and ! for under 4 00 you have your very own precision makeup remover olive oil quick fix this product list on amazon for 20 00 z people will buy any thing ! as i hate to leave a negative ending to this review , i can honestly say , without any it does correct makeup mistakes so the product is not all a joke cannot recommend this product
5	go to polish
5	my wife is in her 50 's and so wrinkles are a fact of every day life she does have young looking skin for her age but the wrinkles are still there she has been using various products for the last 20 years to moisturize and treat fine lines so needless to say , we were skeptical at best of this product her report this serum feels somewhat greasy going on , but once on the skin for a few minutes , feels refreshing and adds moisture upon application , it leaves my skin feeling young and smooth the elixir has a very appealing smell , light and slightly floral after three weeks of use , my husband and i both agree this has reduced lines around the eyes and forehead somewhat , especially when the facial features are relaxed i would say this is the best elixir i have tried
5	i love this product it is safe to use and lasts all week long
5	i have thick short hair thats not easy to manage , as its turning grey the dryness is getting worse so i 've been looking for a product that softens while keeping it manageable , chi silk infusion is easy to apply and works keeping my hair soft and easy to manage , it smells good too with a clean mild scent i always add to my hair right after washing but have to my dry hair still getting good results
3	the product works ok if you 're looking for a retinol containing cream my genetics , although healthy , provide me with dark , puffy eyes i 've tried many topicals with mixed results and no miracles this one was non irritating and goes on easily i ca n't say much improvement maybe one has to use it for 6 12 months i believe it might help more for fine lines , especially in the corners cost prohibitive for my budget
5	i was excited to try the silk'n flash go hair removal system this system is so easy to use you look at the instruction booklet and it will tell you based on your skin tone and hair color what settings you should use when you plug in the ac adapter a series of lights start flashing in a circle one orange and five green as soon as they are all flashing one right after another , the unit is ready to use you shave the area that you want to treat and then start the process of removing your unwanted hair the silk'n flash go system comes with a silk'n trim small pen size trim unit which will allow you to trim areas such as your eyebrows the trim unit also also comes with a shield that will allow you to determine the length of hair or if you want to get rid of it all together the only issue i had with the trim unit was that sometimes it was difficult to turn off it runs on one aaa battery which can easily be replaced by the darker gray shaving head away from the base of to set the energy level simply press the center of where the lights are flashing i was n't sure about this step at first , as i kept clicking the bright fuchsia button on the opposite side of the unit and getting no results when you push the enter button , the lights will remain lite to indicate the level of energy you are using in addition , a small fan will begin blowing to keep the unit cool when you are ready to use the device , hold it against the area you want to treat and turn your eyes away from the bright light that will flash when you push the fuchsia button there may be a little warmth where the unit touches your skin i have just started using the device and am happy with the results the system is easy to use and is compact it comes with its own carrying case which makes it portable and easy to carry with you if needed i will continue to use the unit to see how long it will take to get the desired results the unit is recommended for use on underarms , arms , bikini line , and legs on women and chest and back on men the silk'n flash go also says that you can use it on your chin and upper lip which most units like this do not allow if you leave the unit plugged in , it will reset and the fan will turn itself off
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	nice i saw no drastic difference , but it 's a nice mask i sometimes use it as a moisturizer and do n't wash it off
5	i have used this product for several years and it removes all make up including waterproof mascara
4	i usually use the micellar cleansing water from simple so that 's what i compared this one to both did a great job of removing make up , including mascara , gently and completely but neither could remove lip stain both did an excellent job of removing sweat and grime post workout the only difference i noticed was the vichy water left my face feeling a little tacky not a lot , but when i lightly drag my fingertips across my cheeks , i can feel a slight pulling on the vichy side the feeling diminishes with time and after about 10 minutes , both sides felt the same so , while i like vichy products i'm not sure i like this one enough to switch especially when the product i'm using does an equally good job for less money
5	pretty color , very pink !
5	nice brownish color goes on smoothly
5	awesome color the perfect dark blue
5	this is one off the best products for your face one pump in the morning and one pump at night will give you amazing skin the product make you look younger in just a few months of using gives you smooth beautiful skin stay out of the sun and you will look amazing ! remember the sun is not your friend it breaks down making your face droopy and aged !
3	my wife tried this out i wanted to love this so much , but it fell short of expectations when the primer arrived , i was first surprised at how small the bottle was you do receive 1 0 oz , and that is pretty standard for amount of product per primer , it was just a bit surprising i suppose that means other companies just put the same amount of product in larger appearing packaging so that you think you 're getting more , so thank you julep for that the product has a nice light aroma , however it did not work well with my foundation i tried several brands of foundation and ended up with the same result foundation that appeared cakey additionally , it did not appear to make my makeup last longer than usual either which was a bummer perhaps my skin type was just not meant for this primer , but id say i have pretty normal skin , though middle aged so far this product has really good reviews from others and is from a reputable company sorry , julep i still love you , but my skin makeup did not love this primer
4	is a good curling iron , but still ca n't use at maximum heat without my hair smelling fried \( i cannot stand that smell ! \) i like the non digital temp adjustment , and swivel is nice for operating was concerned about the slickness of barrel , but it still seems to hold hair without a line in the curls not bad for the money
5	if you like the no make up look , this is the perfect foundation for you ! a tiny drop in the palm of my hand covers my whole face especially nice to keep shiny nose at bay highly recommend this !
3	the only nail polish that lasts on my nails highly recommended the only problem is that it takes a while to dry and i often end up messing them up and if you keep it on your nails too long \( two weeks \) it is extremely hard to take off worn makeup remover
5	i love this brush the handle is wrapped in wisteria wisteria is a wonderful plant it has long chains of purple flowers that make a stunning display the are vine like , and that is the part they wrapped around the handle it 's like you are holding concentrated beauty the soft bristles are bound in a soft clump this is a soft brush , for powder the box says you can use it for foundation , but it does n't seem like the right kind of brush for a liquid i prefer to use the stiffer , flatter brush for foundation this brush is good for powder and contouring it works great with a contouring kit if you do n't have a contouring kit , do an amazon search i only discovered they exist recently , and what a great the brush is to an aesthetically pleasing curved point the shape gives it functionality you can cover broad of your face lightly , or you can focus on a small area with the tip with practice , you can get good coverage and you will look beautiful
5	this is the second meg21 product i 've tried and i am still very impressed with it it does n't take much of this smooth radiance face treatment to cover your face , and over applying can lead to it looking heavy and greasy that said , as long as you use just a small amount , it goes on smoothly , smells great and has been non irritating to my skin the main active ingredient , supplamine , is a combination of two that work together to treat glycation glycation is a major cause of skin aging , and is cause by sugars attaching to collagen and elastic , creating inflammation and less resilient skin supplamine not only prevents the toxic sugars from being made , but it also works to neutralize existing toxic sugars
5	love cnd it lasts !
1	it made me break out , especially my chin area to be fair though , i have very sensitive , acne prone skin however , i do recommend their cleanser which really helps to exfoliate
1	i tried this on a few different people in addition to myself and came to the conclusion that it is not too great on any of us is it moisturizing \? the title of this is matte moisture tint , that implies to me that it is moisturizing somewhat in applying it to a variety of skin types and ages , i did not find it at all moisturizing in fact , it applied sort of like a very lightweight paste every person i put it on made some kind of comment about how dry it felt going on even the one with normal to oily skin coverage the coverage of this tint is okay in that it evens out skin appearance , that is if you are about 10 feet away once you get closer , you can see that it sits on top of the skin this tint facial hair , creases , little lines on skin , and really does not look natural at all if you feel old or icky some day , you will probably not feel any better after putting this on wear as time went on , despite the lack of complimentary appearance when wearing it , this tint seemed to become a combination of silicone ish and dry patchy feeling on the skin i really did n't like it , and neither did anyone i tried it on bottom line some tints or foundations are better on one type of skin than others , or a particular age group , but this did n't seem to work for anyone i put it on , from teen to mature women the idea is good , but the product does not seem to deliver moisture or natural looking tint
4	get color but pretty watery
5	i love this sunscreen it 's very light , not sticky or greasy at all it also does not have a strong scent so it 's appropriate for everyday use i know some might think the high spf is overkill but the reality is that must of us do not apply enough sunscreen or reapply it often enough so the extra high spf level will at least give some level of protection this is on the pricier side for sunscreen but it 's worth it for such a well formulated , pleasant to use product
5	i am a 48 year old woman who has combination skin \( dry and oily in different places \) and have never had good success with facial care products this one has cleared my breakouts while not over drying my dry spots i'm amazed ! seriously , this is nothing like other brands' products \( even high end brands \) it does n't have an annoying scent , and a little goes a long way i 've been using this for about 2 weeks now i love the results !
5	awesome color !

5	burberry brit rhythm floral is a light floral , fruity scent to me , the scent is more fruity than floral and reminds me a lot of ralph lauren 's blue \( not sure if they still make that \) it is vibrant and light i am very sensitive to smell and it was not overpowering at all i did find myself sneezing a bit , so i would not recommend if scents tend to trigger your allergies this set includes the larger bottle plus two smaller sizes for your purse or gym bag i do n't find that the scent lasts all day so it is nice to have a smaller bottle for a pick me up in the afternoon the box that it came in is very nice and it would make an impressive gift as well overall i am very pleased with the scent
4	i 've tried many kind of tooth paste and i really like this one not only because it 's made in italy but because of the interesting flavor if you like the scent of jasmine you 'll love this paste the mint flavor is a sweet mint which is a nice change and does n't overpower the jasmine the consistency is a little thicker but still smooth the only draw back is that if you are looking for a natural ingredient paste , this one is not for you it seems to have many of the ingredients in a few other well known brands i wanted this for the flavor as most other brands are boring after so many many many years of brushing if you are looking for a new exciting flavor , and like the scent of jasmine you 'll love this paste
5	as we enter allergy season \( so early this year ! \) , my skin becomes hypersensitive , and i ca n't use a lot of the products that work well and that i tolerate well at other times of year discovering this cleanser , which works very well and does not aggravate allergies sensitivities , has been a real boon i this product
5	i really like this concealer for the imperfections on my fair skin it goes on easily with the brush tip and i use my fingers to finish blending it it necessary the light beige color is good for my skin tone it does a nice job of covering hyperpigmentation so it 's not so visible a little bit goes a long way and this wand is lasting me quite a while it also washes off easily at the end of the day with my facial cleanser i 've been very happy with it and i'm sure i 'll get more when this runs out

5	although expensive , m g menthol shave cream will help you to a damned fine shave icy cool and minty the best menthol shave cream anywhere is noxzema menthol in the light blue can , but proctor gamble has made this flavor unavailable to the us market since 1997 98 it 's only available now to the united kingdom market and the italian market so , with noxzema menthol effectively gone for americans , m g is a worthy substitute plus , i should add this important note m g offers as close and invigorating a shave as the famous kiehl 's white eagle cream , but m g has one clear advantage it rinses much easier and cleaner from the razor
5	no complaints
4	this is a good quality eye shadow you do not need to apply a lot on your skin \( small amount goes a long way \) , but i do wish the pink section showed up a little more on my eyelid \( i have light skin \)
5	quick to ship , the item was received as described love this product ! will buy from again in the future thank you for a smooth transaction
4	usually , my nail polish chips in 1 day this one is long lasting , but i find that i need to shake it often \( almost between each nail \) or it gets clumpy , and then it dries with a dull finish nothing that a little attention to detail and a clear coat ca n't fix i'm really impressed with the long lasting wear which is what bumped it up from a 3 to a 4
5	this is the best nail polish out there period it is free of chemicals , wears really well and has really cool colors what else can i say \? the only nail polish i will buy
5	this review is for the nia 24 eye repair complex , 0 5 fl oz i was at first surprised at how small this bottle was i 've used other eye repair though and most have a similar amount of content nia24 follows a recent trend of using niacin in a molecular formula to stimulate dna repair it has a peptide blend to collagen , vitamin c , licorice and white birch to brighten as well as caffeine to reduce puffiness together , these powerful ingredients target the signs of aging around the orbital bone does it work \? i have used various products with great success , including lancome , l'occitane , , strivectin i believe this formula is on par with those products although each has its own personality i did notice brightening and the general reduction in fine lines as well as a big reduction in dark circles i consider a product of this an indulgence but also necessary as the aging process takes it toll i would recommend this product as equivalent to many of the other luxury eye repair brands
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	my new favorite color this coral is a little sparkly , but without the excessive glitter
3	i 've been mostly pleased with all shellac polishes applied with 2 coats , but this vexed violet , as pretty and shimmering as it is , is still somewhat sheer i recommend applying 3 coats if you desire that opaque colour
4	ok , first and only complaint not certain why this is 20 00 that being said it works well i have short boring eyelashes and this does make them seem fuller longer and a tad it goes on smoothly no clumping and smudging all in all it works well looks good i would use it again for certain but not at this price !
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
4	this is another fun set by vichy first of all , as i 've said in other reviews , the micellar water is the best cleanser i 've ever used on my skin there are lots of brands and they all seem to work well for me my complexion is the it 's been in years the kit includes a large size bottle of the micellar water there are three different masks as well and they are sample size double glow peel mask this is my favorite of the three masks it has barely any scent and is light to apply it certainly does make my skin glow as described quenching mineral mask this is another light mask that really gives moisture to your skin after you use it , you 're supposed to rub it in the skin this always seems weird to me , but i know they just want the product to continue to moisturize your skin i'm a little hesitant to leave it all on my skin , but it 's a nice mask pore purifying clay mask i liked this one the least , but it 's not bad overall it has a strong scent , which bothers me the clay does help with impurities and it 's easy to apply i just prefer the other two over this one all and all a very nice set in a pretty colored tin box this would be a great gift too recommended
4	i am really liking the scent the hold awesome wish it made hair much more shiny , but that can be remedied by just applying a topcoat of a lighter pomade i like to use a of of it as a base in combo with another pomade , but it should be sufficient for most guys to use on its own good stuff it may be a little more pricey that other pomades , but this one is well worth it i love the tin it comes too the top screws on to keep your grease secure this is now my go to grease for my daily routine you can get a kick a pomp , executive contour , side part , or sleek slick back with this grease get some !
4	i attached a photo of how the product appears i wanted to show you how it looked liked compared to my bare skin as you can see i have a greenish blue visible vein and the dreaded cellulite i was n't expecting a miracle product to cover these things but did want a major improvement in appearance this product only slightly blurred these things but did not give me an airbrush look while the color is natural and believable , the product itself did not last long before it started rubbing off on the car or other items i rubbed against the color has an effect \( not fake glitter explosion \) but very subtle and pretty when the sun hits your skin the application was but could spread more easily if mixed with a lotion i went to a pool party and was afraid of getting wet , so , i dipped my foot into the hot tub and a tan line was created shortly after definitely this is a product to use on a date , indoor gathering or possibly a get together , as long as you will not get sweaty or wet this product reminds me of hansen leg makeup but this one has more natural ingredients
5	i was looking for yellow to use when prepping for and really like the color so much that i wear it alone too great spring color ! you must use the cnd topcoat when using this and it will not chip for a couple weeks !
5	not greasy no shine skin feels great
1	terrible experience , once in a kind ! it 's been a month and still i do n't get a simple hair treatment ! by now i could have go to the store and buy it once i contacted the seller he said sorry it 's from overseas \? then he should advertise be sure you wo n't get the product in a month ! i will never buy again from this seller , is not worth the wait !
5	i like this product even if it has some powder fall out it works well in my hair and the smell is great it makes my hair hold curls and look so much better
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
1	i returned this upon first glance the head is huge and to shave with it must be like shaving with a scoop clearly when it comes to shaving less is more company 's , if you really want to corner the market design the size of the razor heads smaller , smaller , smaller !
4	darker than i expected , so i could n't use it but the consistency is very good , and it did not cause any skin irritation
5	i really love this product i have used facial scrubs in the past , but skin getting sensitive as i get older and scrubs being so rough and grainy , i 've started to back off from them not with this product , it 's very gentle to my face and does a nice job cleansing only a is needed to cover my entire face , so this generous tube will likely last quite a while i am sensitive to perfumes and other strong odors , but i really did n't pick up on anything like that with this product , another huge plus for me
3	this is a rich , well absorbed and moisturizing cream low on potential allergens and feels good on the skin this product line is from birth on and benefits anyone with dry or sensitive skin the down side for me is that i find the perfume in this product very irritating and i ca n't see putting it on a child 's face , let alone my own i am not sure why this fragrance was chosen but it is noxious mustela products used to have a pine fresh scent but this fragrance is not at all pleasing to me short of the fragrance \( which is a very individual thing \) this would be a 5 star cream
5	love this product i 've tried other products , i 've used peels , toners , exfoliation but nothing made any difference even after months of use the ideal life serum made a visible difference in just a few days ! almost immediately , my pores looked smaller and after a few weeks my skin looks and feels firmer and more radiant what 's equally shocking is that vichy does all this at a drugstore price i 've used most of the major drugstore brands and several luxe brands that did n't perform as quickly or as well as this life serum
4	picked this up for my wife she would rub her eyes red wiping off her make up , and i thought she would prefer this remover which gets rid of the make up , but it 's actually good for your skin
5	such a pretty nail polish that i 've been wanting for so long ! shipped really fast !
5	this curling iron was able to put a curl in my hair and make it stay all day without anything but hairspray i have straight very silky hair and it will not do anything unless i load it up with hair product maybe this curling iron gets really hot , or the plating makes a difference , all i know is it works !
5	this one is one of the better \( if not best \) jack black product 's i have tried so far has a great smell that lasts a long time and this one gives a slick nice wet look that i love it also lasts through the whole day which is a big plus not having to worry about my hair getting flat over the course of the day i just wish there was a little more product for the buck but this did a great job that i probably will be buying more in the future if you are thinking about buying it i would definately give it a try !
5	best spot treatment , ever ! ! it does have a strong scent but it fades after a few minutes my blemishes are normally about 50 smaller by morning
5	this is my second bottle of the cleanser the first i gave to mom and second one for myself the surface cleaner does help the polish stay on a little longer but you are sure that you had clean nails and no natural oils on them definitely a good buy
5	i ca n't yet speak to how effective the spf is , but the moisturizer is thick yet goes on light and is not oily it blends very well and does n't leave any film on your face i tend to break out from moisturizers , but have n't had that problem with this one
5	it is a little greasy but i do n't mind since i put it on before bedtime my facial skin loves it and make it very soft no weird flowery smell a little goes a long way
5	probably one of my favourite essie blues ! i just cant get enough of this beachy , breezy color !
5	gorgeous color i love , love , love it ! only need 1 coat , but using 2 plus opi 's base and top coat makes pedicure last at least 1 month
2	the color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats who 's got time for that
5	this crayon is fantastic and black is the best outer rim one of many that i own these are well made and go on with very little effort good staying power looks sexy and sultry and you smudge it also looks good but personal preference i like a good clean line , most of the time but when i go out i smudge it to get that come look try this in black first you will come back for more
5	love this lipgloss ! has a pink flavor to it and it stays on very well through eating and drinking
5	testing this as a free product from the amazon vine program i like this scent , it 's quite a timeless masculine scent with plenty of woody overtones a little oriental spice and some musk but not overpowering fragrances are so subjective so it 's difficult to recommend this for everyone , but from the point of view of everyday wear it seems to last well through the day and into the early evening , something some more expensive or well known fragrances do not presence was launched in so it 's been around a while , top notes are ginger , cinnamon , bergamot and cardamom middle notes are apple , sage and base notes are wood , sandalwood , tonka bean , amber and white musk nice mix of a fresh modern scent combined with some classic tones that lasts a little pricey for edt \( mine as tested is a 2 5oz bottle \) as the listing at 55 is for a 1 7oz or 50ml , and this price range is usually 3 4oz or
4	it works well , but the smell is a little medicinal i found that philip b maui and beach blow texturizing mist work even better the latter products both have sea salt , but the ocean mist spray has the main ingredient as alcohol , so that was disappointing it did work , although i would recommend the other two products to work better
5	great product ! i would recommend this to anyone who with thinning hair it is easy to use and it is n't too expensive
5	the best mineral powder on the market !
5	as someone with combination skin and a mild case of milia , i 've tried quite a few products out there , including very expensive ones , and ones recommended by dermatologists this stuff is great i 've used it for about a week and the result is that my skin is far less bumpy and more smooth after it 's definitely a touch harsh in that it helps your skin turn over faster , so the areas where i had a breakout up and fell off over night , resulting in smoother skin afterwards there 's no real perfume or added scent , other than the scent of the glycolic cleanser itself , which smells mildly medicinal i recommend this for anyone , especially women in their 30 's with cystic acne or an uneven texture to their skin my skin glows after using , especially when i use it with the clarisonic brush
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	great summer color ! !
5	i have light eyebrows but ive never used an eyebrow pencil because i did n't want the painted on with a magic marker look so i do n't have other pencils with which to compare this one the blonde color is subtle enough to blend in with my brows and make them look fuller without being obvious the brush on the other end is a nice touch i like it
5	i wo n't go back to regular polish again i love doing my nails and it lasting for two weeks great product !
4	this color is sexy ! just when i thought i had enough pink polishes , essie comes out with a beautiful hot summery fuchsia and i am forced to get just one more while bottle service is part of essies neon collection , i wouldnt classify it as neon because it is n't obnoxiously bright as with most neon polishes , this one dries matte , so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish the formula is rich , easy to apply , with beautiful color pigmentation the color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now in regards to the actual color , i have very pale skin \( no tan whatsoever \) and this color looks fantastic on and doesnt wash me out like some bright colors do
4	took this on my recent trip to a tropical island it worked great and blended well into the skin unlike the same brand tinted spf cream \( do n't waste your money on that stuff \) my husband used it too and he liked it no breakouts from sunscreen and we also did not burn
5	this colors and unique
2	marketing and packaging , and you can easily transform poopy pants into fancy pants with that said , lets take a closer look at skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil impressive company history impressive company logo impressive track record at nordstrom impressive 30 price ticket sometimes we believe for a higher price , we get higher quality sometimes and sometimes not ! whether in english , italian or any other language , it amounts to the universal language across the board the brilliance of marketing and packaging a product personally , i would never pay 30 for an oil that i use as a makeup remover i typically buy 3 99 towelettes at for that purpose however , as a vine member , i thought i would give it a go and put the oil to the test though i use oil sparingly on my face , i tried using skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil on a cotton ball to strip the pore cleaning mask off my face the oil is scentless , which is fine , did an okay job stripping my mask , but feels very much like , duh , greasy oil ! the oil in the bottle does separate , but a few good shakes and no problem the next day , my face felt oilier than usual and my forehead broke out that skin , however , is not the reason i gave this product a negative review nope , not at all i took it a step further and decided to investigate some of the ingredients that skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil here is a quick 1 aqua ummm , okay so it consists mostly of water not too impressive 2 sweet almond oil overall , good moisturizing nutrient that helps to reduce inflammation and irritation of the skin 3 isononyl isononanoate this is the third ingredient , which means it is the third prominent ingredient in the oil after the sweet almond oil ingredient i found that this chemical is a potentially pore clogging irritating ingredient 4 ethylhexylglycerin okay , theres just a dab of this ingredient in the product because it falls on the bottom of the ingredient list however , it is on the bubble and bee list of chemicals to avoid list and i what its used for deodorant agent , skin conditioning agent , preservative booster avoid it because it is a known skin irritant , can possibly damage and irritate eyes , and is known to cause dermatitis what its made from derived from vegetable glycerin dont let the fact that its derived from vegetable glycerin fool you so is glycol ! many of the natural and organic companies use this as an alternative to parabens as a preservative no matter what their label claims , it is not a natural preservative and i repeat no matter what their label claims , it is not a natural preservative so , i ask you skin co roma truffle therapy cleansing oil poopy pants or fancy pants \? to be fair , i the other ingredients in the bottle and found the majority of ingredients to pass with flying colors just be aware , that if you want to put your best face forward , be fully aware of what you put on it ! i , personally , prefer nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href viva naturals organic argan oil 4 oz moroccan luxury oil for silky smooth hair softer skin dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 viva naturals organic argan oil 4 oz , moroccan luxury oil for silky , smooth hair softer skin a , another oil i was reviewing along with skin brand it is a pure oil , not one that is chemical based and certainly cheaper to use in the long run
4	this goes on light and smooth i was worried about whether this would provide even coverage and it does it is the first time i am using a powder bronzer i think i still prefer the cream type bronzers but i was pleasantly surprised with how easy to use this one is
5	just what i had used in salon , but they no longer want to carry it , so i'm doing my nails myself saving 25 00 every 2 weeks !
1	i 've worn mineral makeup for quite a few years now and try and use natural products i wanted to search for pressed powder as it 's not as messy as the loose this had good reviews so i gave it a try well , it 's by far the worst makeup i 've ever tried it looks so oily and cakey on my skin i only used it a couple times and it caused me to break out horribly my understanding from other reviews is that an older formula used to be better maybe that 's the reason for so many good reviews \? i'm not sure , but i also ordered other mineral products with this powder and they were all completely awful their customer service is horrible too , it took 3 weeks to get a to an email and when you call the phone rings and then eventually hangs up , you ca n't even leave a message i would advice to avoid this company at all costs luckily , i was able to find tarte cosmetics and love them i definitely prefer their pressed compact better and of course , you can purchase tarte on amazon
5	i have been using avene products for several years now this cream is light and works well for me during the summer months once it gets colder , i will switch to the avene cream that comes in a tube i like the packaging on this product makes it easier to squeeze just enough and the flip top is convenient
5	i love this lightly scented plumping night cream i use it after washing my face at bedtime and it makes my skin feel so soft and supple i tend to have dry skin and i definitely need moisturizing for that as well as plumping for my fine lines around my eyes and lip line it is a nice , thicker cream and it does n't take much of the product to produce the effects i'm thinking that it might be good to use in the morning as well before i apply my makeup as i like what it does to my skin i am a sucker for beauty products and i try almost anything to improve the look and feel of my skin some products are too thin but this has a really creamy feel that i really like unlike some other products i 've tried , it does n't take but a few fingertip into the jar to get the effect that i want a little goes a long way !
2	makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull not a natural look i will not buy this again
5	item is as described and arrived promptly
4	ive used this mascara for a few days , and i like it a lot i like to wear makeup , but im a fan of a natural effect rather than the look and this mascara helps me to achieve the look i like in my eyes the brush applies the mascara smoothly and it does not dries up giving my lashes a fake look , which other mascaras do even when new this la roche posay mascara gives my lashes a natural enhance look , while separating the lashes in a nice way however , it smudges without tiny black flakes all over i do n't mind to have a little mascara stain under my eyes at the end of the day , but the flaking i cant handle , because i wear contact lenses so , this is a mascara that i would order again in the future and recommend to others , in spite of the smudging , because the benefits of the lack of irritation and the natural appearance
5	i was disappointed when i first got this because i thought it was white with silver sparkles in it it is just a sparkle , but a very fine intense sparkle that makes all my shellacs look metallic , which i love ! ! ! i will put this over all my shellac 's from now on , it makes every color look sooo much better i highly recommend this if you love the sparkle too \)
4	this does a nice job minimizing the occasional dark circles under my eyes it blends and absorbs easily and is gentle on my sensitive skin there is no greasy feeling and it stays in place all day it has a flexible applicator that makes it easy to get the cream under my eyes , but i have n't been able to use it to blend it in all the way and still resort to finishing it off using my fingers i do n't see much in the way of anti aging as there are still fine lines in my skin to be fair , i did n't expect any anti aging miracles as i'm well beyond the early signs of aging and into the visible signs category rather , i was looking for a good , lightweight cream concealer to brighten up my eyes , and this does the job nicely
5	i do not know about the rest of the , but i like having soft skin i like when people tell me its touchable l'occitane almond supple skin oil takes my soft skin and turns it into a velvety epidermis of silk i love the way it smells , like almonds but more like of almonds its earthy and sweet not overpowering and definitely not perfume y it soaks in so fast , i loved rubbing it into every curve and i did not use it on my face too much because i am super sensitive but i did try it out as a makeup remover and it was magnificent , no problems what so ever it also did not irritate my skin anywhere it is supposed to firm up your flesh , i did not find that happening i was happy enough that it made me feel like a queen
2	i did not like this face wash and was pretty disappointed because i am a huge la roche posay fan their other products have really impressed me but this face wash burned my eyes so badly even without getting it directly in them , just in the normal course of washing my face it also left my skin really really clean which may sound great but i could n't help but feel it was stripping my skin of every single bit of moisture i swear my skin would make a noise when i rubbed my finger over it after using this so , no thank you , i would like to keep my moisture barrier
4	although i have worn this makeup for only a few days , i have found it to be complimentary to my makeup regime i have an oil based sun repair serum that i love and use on my face prior to applying my foundation because this foundation is for oily skin and is oil free it causes no problems with the foundation application and literally glides on without any issues i like it because it gives my skin that flawless look without a heavy caked on look and heavy feel it still lets my skin breathe
5	love the color and coverage stays on forever
5	i 've recently discovered that my thick hair was starting to fall out around the bangs area through the tears i decided to try different products to see which was the best for me i tried tinted dry shampoo , root touch up spray and toppik the root touch up spray was just ok , i felt that i had to spray paint on my head it does cover grays roots very well ! tinted dry shampoo was better and passable , i like the feel of it though plus you have to brush a lot of the dust out toppik was my favorite of the 3 by far it covered well and blended in nicely with my hair color this is what i 'll be using !
4	nice color
4	i use jane iredale skin products , lip face very natural looking !
4	way more transparent than i thought pretty color with fine glitter it 's nice as a tint of color need 3 4 coats for opaqueness
4	everyone 's skin is so different there is no way to tell how a product will react from one person to another i wanted this to cover dark age sun spots , but on me it turned orange y and settled in fine lines it also was a bit difficult to apply even using a makeup sponge dermablend is an excellent product and it takes time to find the right color blend i have other ones that are perfect for me it did not cause any irritation
5	i start my daily revision facial regime with this facial wash a little dot goes a long way produces a light foam to clean face follow with other revision products
5	i am in love with shellac it lasts without chips for 2 weeks \( only because you nails grow out \)
4	my mom went to a recently and has brought home c e lotion samples before but this one smells amazing ! i love it i do n't think i 'd purchase it because of the price but it smells great and does not leave my hands oily i 'll wait until she brings home more samples !
4	this is a coral red color good for spring , summer , and fall it 's one of my favorite colors to wear these polishes are very nice to apply and dry super quick however , i do not ever get a full week of wear without chips all of my vinylux polishes last about three days without chips and then the tips start to show significant wear and tear i have been using theses polishes once to twice a week for the past month or two with good results i have the full cnd shellac system and i have to say , i like the vinylux line way better than the gel
4	i use this powder to conceal the shine from circle concealers and it does a good job i can still see a little bit of powdery effect , but you have to get real close to see it when i do n't use it sometimes the shine is very obvious especially on hot days so this powder helps a lot to keep the under control i do n't use very much so this one compact will last me a very long time i also have a few very light freckles and they are nicely covered with this powder
4	i am 55 and have started dealing with drier skin i may not be the best market for this product i liked the feel and smell and it did not irritate my skin i felt like it did improve my pores but not as dramatically as i hoped it did not dry out my skin but i did n't find it especially moisturizing either , but , again , i feel like i am at the stage where i need a lot of moisture overall a good product
3	as a mother of an infant i have permanent dark circles under my eyes when i had the opportunity to try this concealer i jumped at the chance unfortunately , it is too light sheer to cover my dark circles it works well for highlighting and covering red blemishes the tool is phenomenal and works great even with my cheap concealer that does a better job covering dark circles lastly , if you are trying to avoid them this product is not paraben free
5	i have been using cnd for a year now and love it very fast service and will order more my favorite color
5	this has been the only cream that keeps my skin moisturized throughout the day i work in a freezing cold office so i have a personal space heater that really dries out the air and my skin , but after using this moisturizer i 've really felt a difference in my skin i used to use the super thick nivea original cream from germany but this works so much better and without making your face look shiny and greasy
5	received for my wife and she really likes it in fact she loves all the products from nia24 let 's start off with a basic fact , a little goes a very long way this is not a moisturizing cream like you would get at the super market and slather on in large globs the nia24 products are so concentrated and so effective that you apply this in terms of drop sized amounts 2 3 drops will get your entire face covered so a small jar will easily last several weeks or a few months my wife uses it first thing in the morning prior to putting on any make up and then again at night before going to bed
2	it was not the color shown nor what i expected its a brown gray
5	our older son has extremely sensitive skin and is prone to eczema after several skin related infections due to over dryness , our pediatrician recommended the mustela line of bath and skin products they are amazing we use this bath gel every other bath , alternating with the bath oil it keeps his skin hydrated even if we do n't put a lotion on after the bath this cleans without drying or damaging his skin and has a light , scent and feel only , which helps in dealing with finicky little boys \( or girls \) and does n't leave his skin feeling anything but smooth if you or our child are prone to dry skin , this is a great solution well worth the price and much gentler than leading baby soaps
5	love opi !
3	very gentle on the skin , with very mild scent its also hypoallergenic but i do n't think the best products are used because my husband still breaks out and we think its from the soap it lathers really well and the container is in a nice , large size that will last a while !
5	i am using this more for a concealer and i apply it with a makeup sponge using a tap tap application rather than rubbing it in that does not work for me this covers my rosacea and my sun damage spots , which as i age , are becoming larger there is a learning curve to using a dermablend product as i found out after applying too much and looking like a clown start out with less and if need , build on that , but when i used less product and gently worked with it , it onto my skin not into the skin , but onto it with a lovely finish it did not settle into pores or fine lines i have yet to use the setting powder , but for the length of time i have this on , it stays in place i have tried so many products to cover my issues and none have been satisfactory , now , after hearing about dermablend for many , many years , i am finally using it and am happy with the results if you are near a store that carries it , it might be more to go in and see the colors on your skin before buying and see what works best for you then , for future purchase do it online where it might be less expensive give it a try , you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by just covering up a mark or tattoo or scar that you are self conscious about i know using it has made me want to take better care of my skin
5	you cant go wrong with any nia 24 products ! ! although this does make my face a little dry if i use it every day its still a great product instead of every day , i use it every other day and it works great ! !
5	i experienced bioelements equalizer mist during my recent visit to salon that uses this product line esthetician used it after cleansing and in between , serums and mask to refresh the skin and reset ph levels of the skin she used it as a mist and i absolutely loved the pleasant scent of the product the product uses chinese herbs and natural extracts such as ginseng , , , rose oil , oil and many others 6 oz bottle can go a long way this is professional product and it can be purchased at salons that use bioelements line it prepares skin for and i use it at day and night it works as a mist and instead of using cotton puffs pads , i apply paper tissues and gently dab it on my skin to remove any access and help this technique allows better product in the skin
5	perfect for touch ups when you do n't want to get a manicure every day for 10 , even better for those with real nails
4	my wife and i have both been using the tizo photoceutical am rejuvenation day cream each day and we both agree that this is a very good product it does make the skin on our face soft and healthy looking , which is just what it says it will do on the box it came in the box also tells me that tizo am is formulated with peptides , niacinamide , tea tree oil and powerful antioxidants as peptides are the first ingredient listed , i decided to find out more about them for readers of this review peptides are among the most powerful and interesting skin care ingredients being used in successful anti wrinkle products the article goes on to say that they are short chain amino acids which are now being used in a variety of products like the tizo day cream anti wrinkle is too strong a claim for the tizo day cream people expecting this cream to do away with their wrinkles are going to be disappointed reduce yes eliminate no for those readers concerned about the scent of this product , it does have a very slight and pleasant smell some people will hardly notice it , but one reviewer found the smell not to the reviewers liking of course , each of us is different , but i think most people will find the slight scent of tizo acceptable i am guessing that few people reading this review are going to expect a miracle in a bottle , but for 60 00 they do expect a fine product that works well to promote healthy skin , and this is just what tizo appears to do
5	my skin has never looked so good even though i have only been using strivectin for a couple of weeks i can see a huge difference in my forehead wrinkles and a significant reduction in the wrinkles around my mouth and nose and between my eyes now , i 've used creams that have helped with my forehead wrinkles in the past but nothing has ever made a real difference in the wrinkles around my mouth and nose the only cons i found were minor for example , i'm not fond of the smell but i can live with it and the texture is a little thicker than what i'm used too but when it dries my face feels moist rather than sticky i would definitely buy this again
5	love this machine , need more new heads tho
3	there 's good news and bad news the good news the bubblegum pink does n't go on noticeably pink at all , so no rabbit eyes it does make a nice top of the cheekbone highlighter the shadows stay all day , in humidity over a thin , dried coat of smashbox primer , as i always do the darkest color is not too red more of a brown maroon no fallout or flaking the bad news the two pink shades show up as sheer white frost the taupe shade is slightly darkening , but not much and is pretty much overwhelmed by the frost the only shade that seems to show noticeably different is the darkest one , which does make a nice liner over a thin line of brown smashbox always sharp dark brown it is not opaque enough to use as a liner without a deep solid base under it i am a medium toned white person with hazel eyes that look like green with a dark ring around the outside and a star of orange in the middle
5	love chi hair products
4	i have both dry and oily skin that sometimes causes a rash near my goatee went to nordstrom and and got a jack black serum and jack black double duty moisturizer it worked great and my skin looks great and no rash i was given a sample of dry erase to substitute for the old formula moisturizer the dry erase seems to go on easier once it 's on my face it gets absorbed with little effort also a little goes a long way which is nice the smell is a little overwhelming but not a deal breaker only wish the ingredients were listed on the tube
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	i was never really into the expensive nail polishes like essie however , one day i fell in love with a color my friend was wearing it was dj play that song so i asked her if i could borrow it the polish went on very smooth i always were a bottom coat i only had to put 2 coats on to achieve the desired color i loved it ! ! i am a faithful fan of essie now , with dj play that song as my most favorite polish color it is a slight neon purple color , however not to bold i have it on my toes now and receive tons of compliments
5	i ordered the more the merrier and i really enjoy the color essie quality is great about 99 of the time , so you ca n't really go wrong stays on well , for about a week they sent me the wrong color at first , but when i emailed them about it , they quickly fixed the mix up !
5	so i had finally bought some butter i avoided it because i just could n't get over the price however , i liked one of the colors very much and decided to give them a shot because their shape is a bit easier to store so , i bought a set kit thing and a 3 different colors one of the colors of the butters i did n't like that much against my skin , so , i decided because i loved the bottle so much \( this is awful do n't judge me \) i poured out the color \( i knew i would never use a color that did n't match my skin , and could n't find someone else who wanted it either \) and poured one of my opi 's into the empty butter bottle i noticed in this process of pouring out that the consistency of the butter london is much thicker than opi and even though the oz in the bottle is less than in the opi bottle it seemed to take forever to pour out i actually started to think the opi seemed cheap by how quickly it poured out which i have never thought before ! in the kit there was a cuticle oil , a clear top coat , a flesh color , and a nail polish remover the remover at first smells like any other remover but once that initial smell went away it made my hands smell like roses it was wonderful ! ! the cuticle oil smells very good as well and the top coat is awesome in case you have n't seen one in a store , the top black part actually pops off which i thought was kind of strange but i do n't mind it once the top pops off you have a lid to twist to open the bottle i think its just for design which i like because it makes for clean storage because of the solid rectangular shape i beat up my hands \( i'm an artist and a cook and i work sets sometimes \) so , my hands get beat up this nail polish really lasts i will say it does this weird thing where it in a way that does n't chip the polish which is great even though looks a little funny that took a long time to happen though i officially have been converted to butter london , however , they lack a lot of colors so , when they come out with more i will investigate i completely recommend this brand if you are able to spare the cost for the quality
5	lasts and lasts love it
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	i really like this cream , my only issue with it is the pump straw which is way too short so it 's hard to get anything out of it unless you keep it upside down but once that is solved , this is a very nice cream , the recommendation is to only pump twice , and it 's more than enough for your face , it 's light , does n't feel greasy and it has a very pleasant scent
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	im turning 40 , but i do n't have the time or the to spend hours on my face i only wear makeup for special occasions the extent of my facial routine is moisturizer i am currently using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href olay regenerist dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 olay regenerist a the juice is made with certified organic ingredients now , this means that a portion of the ingredients are certified organic not all of the ingredients are certified organic , which to me makes the organic claim a little questionable the cream itself is thicker than im used to in a moisturizer , but it goes on smoothly and evenly it can feel a bit greasy if you apply too much , so use sparingly until you find the amount that is right for you if you are used to using products with shea butter , you will immediately recognize the feel of this moisturizer as for the scent , i have trouble placing it sometimes im sure it smells like a musty chamomile , other times i find it smells like black licorice , which i assume is the sodium \( i guess this is a form an anise \? \) i find it moisturizes well my skin definitely doesnt feel dry but it does feel coated it doesnt leave behind an oily or greasy feel , but you can tell that something has been applied
4	released nearly 30 years ago and still selling strong ck 's for men is a classic fragrance with multiple layers of scent elements blended together to provide a concoction that is at once mysterious , and deeply intimate the balance of elements is near perfect the scents of sandalwood and smoke hit you first but the citrus and floral topnotes reveals its presence with perfect timing do note that this is a strong fragrance a half spritz is really all i need to last through the course of a day the 1 ounce bottle will last a lot longer than you think and the smaller sizing makes for much easier transport on your trips and other such of pleasure
5	i normally do n't wear foundation daily , only when i'm going out , but i 've heard good things about this brand , so i gave it a try this is going to replace the brand i was using , i love the texture and the feel of it on my skin it was like i was n't wear anything i was really happy that for once i got a sample cosmetic that actually fit my skin tone ! high 5 !
5	you ca n't lose with ahava ! they deliver again with a delicate and light long lasting cream gel going on smoothly it is easily absorbed and will continue throughout the day you will feel spa like fresh using this after a bath , shower , shaving excellent product
5	okay so i 've cut my hair down to a more manageable length and it has decided that it want 's to go very cotton ball with this cut my hair is thin but there is a ton of it about half of it is and the other half is curly \( no or reason as to which half at any given moment \) the key is that my hair is dry very very dry it 's not quite to the look yet but i figure when i hit 40 i will probably attain that quality i have tried several different hair products to see what makes my hair as simple to do as possible while still looking okay many of the leave in conditioners \( which is what i am considering this \) leave my hair looking like i rolled around in grease or that i have n't washed my hair in a month i purchase a lot from sephora so i tend to get a lot of samples from them and have tried many different conditioners , oils , moisturizers etc after using this a bit here is my take on it my hair is about 4 5 inches long and i do n't need a full pump of this product the full pump would probably still be a bit too much back when my hair was shoulder length this is n't a bad thing just letting you know that you do n't need a lot of this at any given time to have a great effect i have found that using this product leaves my hair much less dry feeling it 's bouncy and moisturized without being greasy the scent is also very nice it 's an attractive scent that is very light , nothing overpowering it is rare that i try a hair product and decide that i would actually buy it again i honestly plan on getting more of this when i run out it appears pricy at first but with the tiny amount that you need it will most of the other products by a long shot
2	i believe this product is a little misleading in its claim to minimize puffiness and dark circles i have not seen that result when i used as directed \( just a small drop \) i did find that it soothed dry under eye skin so if your under eye problem is mostly due to that then this might be a little more helpful than it was for me
5	i 've been using the clarisonic mia 1 with the radiance head i wanted to try this deep pore head to see how it would impact the rough texture created by age spots i noticed the difference right away this head has a more robust action even compared to the radiance head my skin looked smoother and less dull i would not be able to use this head daily but for a weekly treatment it is perfect for making my skin look as good as possible the difference was especially noticeable around my nose and forehead i do recommend this head for vigorous deep cleaning
3	i have been using this daily for two weeks so far , i have n't noticed any difference in the texture of my skin this does not mean the device does not work the included states that it can take up to sixty days to see results there are some peer reviewed studies that indicate that microcurrent treatments can improve firmness , but not wrinkles time will tell this device is easy to use , attractive , and charges well however , it does take a commitment to use this on a daily basis some of the side effects of using this product include eye during treatment , metallic taste in the mouth when i get anywhere near the hairline with this device , my scalp as well a tube of gel is included with this product , but it does n't last very long i will soon need to buy another tube , which can add up over time bottom line this device can help improve skin firmness , but requires a significant commitment of time and money it is also not very pleasant to use do i plan to keep using it \? yes i need to give this a chance would i recommend it to friends \? at this point , i'm not sure that i would
5	this is a cream that hydrates and causes no irritation avene simply does n't make a bad product ! if you a in doubt please try this , it works ! !
5	review of nuxe contour des prodigieux anti fatigue moisturizing eye cream , 0 5 fl oz nuxe is a reputable french company which has been producing cosmetics of natural origin for some time their anti fatigue moisturizing eye cream is used by my wife and she loves it the cream makes the skin under and around her eyes taut and thus reduces wrinkles while moisturizing the container is small at 05 ounces but only a small pea sized amount is needed per application the scent is pleasant like that of faint almonds and the creme is absorbed rapidly in the skin my wife swears that any former dark circles under her eyes are now gone great product at five stars
5	recommended to me by my barber i have a traditional side part and this is the first hair product i 've found that keeps my hair in place but does not look like i have any product in my hair after towel drying i use a brush to achieve my desired look , then smooth a pea sized dollop of this stuff over my hair and then run the brush through one last time my hair stays and looks great all day ! great product !
2	i 've used seche vite , and out the door top coats and this one is the worst of all slow drying and no shine at all no point of using this for top coat ! will never buy this one
5	as a long time user of axe body sprays , i was definitely intrigued when i saw calvin klein making a splash into the body deodorant marketplace that has a death grip on eternity now definitely has a stronger , more fragrant scent than the axe sprays that for the most part are very light and pleasant before fading out scent wise throughout the day the eternity scent stays with you , mostly because he starting scent is so strong and pungent if you like this smell , you will love the eternity as it could almost be used as a cologne replacement as well , and in my opinion that is the niche market where this product has the opportunity to as a hybrid deodorant cologne , this product goes from being one of the most expensive deodorants sprays on the market to being one of the cheaper designer quality colognes if you like pleasant , strong smelling colognes with rich undertones and you 're looking to shave some money off your cologne spending , this product is worth trying out but if you 're sold on the cologne you wear that is n't overpowered by your current axe body spray , take a pass on this offering because this spray will definitely overpower your cologne
5	my wife tried this out and she 's loving it she has really dry skin especially when it gets a bit colder here so she 's been using this to hydrate recently and finding her skin feels much more comfortable after applying it it 's lightweight so it does n't leave a heavy sort of residue on her skin which she claims makes this much better than some other moisturizers she 's tried using also her skin is sensitive but she has n't had any breakouts as a result of using it she highly recommends it
5	perfect base color for a french or worn alone !
5	this blue something about it it just catches the eye def a keeper
5	jane iredale products are the tops i love the bright colors and for fall it is even more amazing always looking good love this product cheryl
5	my daughter wears makeup , not only just because she 's a young woman , but because she is often on stage performing \( she is a college student who is studying performance \) the ivory tint is perfect for her skin tone and the coverage is really good perfect for singing on stage the makeup blends easily and well she does have some skin issues , but this made her skin look flawless it feels nice going on as well i watched her apply it , and it really was easy to go on , without looking heavy or cakey it stayed perfect all day long , keeping it from looking too shiny or oily
5	beautiful color
4	i am not a makeup junkie i'm towards fifty and do n't have the average 17 year old 's makeup skills on an average day i wear eyeliner and drugstore foundation or powder when offered this sample product to review i was interested to see if it could provide a quick solution to a bit better appearance at work \( i tend to have dark circles and somewhat red skin \) this primer feels lovely when applied it is velvety and not oily in my experience it does improve the look of my skin and the lasting power of my makeup not sure how i feel about covering my face with silicon \) , but i really like the look and feel of this primer loses a star due to the crazy price point makeup wo n't at the price , but the average person will in short , this is a very nice quality product reminds me of past experiences with the clinique line size of product is generous and the dispenser is very nice , smooth operating and dispensing just enough avoiding waste if you want to make primer a part of your routine this product is a good choice
5	these are great and i ca n't find 20 in local stores
3	not for me i have sensitive skin and this product carries a lot of dimethicone dimethicone is sort of filler that makes you skin look smooth by filling in pores or lines and blurring them i have products that carry it that do not bother me but the high content in this cream actually clogged my pores and i could not use for very long before i had to wash it all off my skin felt like it could not breathe it may cause break outs or bumps i think it does make you look nice if you can tolerate it but this is not for people with skin sensitivity
4	the anthony glycolic wipes are good wipes to use on a daily basis i like the exfoliating and resurfacing sides of the wipes i did n't use a face scrub when i was using the anthony wipes these wipes are good to use in the morning and at night , do n't be if the package the wipes come in are warm that is normal for the package to be warm if it is summer time and it is really hot where you are located i do n't know if i will purchase this product again because i was not that impressed with the wipes , that 's just my opinion
5	great coverage and lasting color
5	normally when i am given a facial moisturizer or anti aging cream for review , i have to try it out for quite a while to see if it lives up to its hype in this case , i did n't have to why \? because i used to use this a few years ago and its great i used to visit a top doctor in beverly hills and i had gotten facials and fillers and some beauty products to try well , i did n't care much for the fillers , but i did love the products , the main one being this the skinmedica tns essential serum this doctor told me that all the top doctors and recommend this product and its the one that he and his staff all use i do n't want to use his name here but youve probably heard of him and he does have an excellent reputation he never gave me bad advice so why did i stop \? only because it became too expensive no stars off for that , because i think a product should be reviewed on how well it works and it does work i do have a recommendation about this before you first use the product , tap it solidly on its base on the counter a few times you want the two serums to come out evenly and at the same time when you use the pump so i do recommend this it is expensive and you are somewhat in how much you use , since it dispenses the same amount with every pump so you cant stretch this out to make it last longer still , it really is great
5	i absolutely love this product dermablend use to only make a total coverage foundation that covered scars , birthmarks and tattoos i love that they now have into a more user friendly cosmetic line this powder foundation has a good medium coverage and is buildable to full coverage if desired the finish is soft and matte to get the best look use a blender sponge to apply and the sponge that comes with it for touchups i have fine , sensitive oily skin and this lasts pretty much all day the color is true to the photo and it does not turn orangey on the skin
4	lathers up really nicely , and has a very neutral scent i do n't have that much facial hair to shave off , but it 's still nice to get this lather going and to have a very smooth shave much appreciate
4	i'm not much for skin care sets i like to buy my products separately , since i always use one up one product before another , but this is a very nice product , and would make a nice gift for someone the foaming wash is very refreshing , the cream has a nice light scent , and the peel left my face feeling fresh and clean not a product i would buy , but a very nice product
2	the color does not come out like it is pictured until you apply about 4 coats who 's got time for that
1	despite the name saying oil control , this lotion is very oily so oily , in fact , that when i squeeze it out , only oil comes out i have tried shaking and massaging the bottle , and it still is separated i am so frustrated this is a poor product i'm obsessed with the mario badescu line so i'm assuming this is a very old product that the seller tried to pass off if it was n't such a pain to return it , i would have it 's just went in the trash after 4 or 5 tries what a waste

5	nice color for summer essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping would recommend essie polish great deal
5	just starting to use this following the mario badescu glycolic cleanser no irritation after a couple of uses and feels great on middle aged skin ,
5	i have color treated hair which needs some extra help to look good , by which i mean that i have to use rich conditioners and i am not one of those lucky few who can go with just shampoo alone this conditioner has a very thick consistency , and reminds me lot of l'oreal total repair 5 damage erasing balm , by how it affects my hair this oribe intense conditioner has a very nice pleasant smell , it reminds me of men 's perfume i do like it , and i think it would work very well for mens hair i do not mean that it is very strongly a men 's scent , or that women can not use it i like it the rich consistency of this oribe intense conditioner hydrates my hair well and makes my hair less fuzzy i did n't see any difference by holding it for 10 minutes in my hair or just by applying and rinsing after just one minute it works well for me and i am very glad i tried it
2	this is a basic under eye concealer brush and given the long name attached to this to justify the ridiculous price , you would think this was invented by itself ! first of all , the moment you hold this under 5 inches of concealer brush in your hands , you will think in no way is the 40 price tag justified the sponge tip is nothing like the beauty blender people are wondering you can wet it but there is n't any purpose to it since it does n't expand the tip is soft but also quite floppy which for some may mimic the way you pad on the product with your index finger in the under eye area that said , i'm concerned that given how floppy it is , it may not last long i maybe in the but had to post an honest review since 40 is lot of money to shell for a tiny slip of a brush there are much better concealer brushes out there for half the price
4	did not receive instruction booklet
5	this is a beautiful perfume ! i 've been getting compliments for weeks wearing this scent it 's not overpowering but subtle it has a nice refreshing scent , a bit floral , fruity and musky i think it 's a scent that just makes you feel good wearing it the bottle is the diamond on my vanity the top just glitters with it 's and gold , and the glass just lets light shine through it i would definitely purchase this perfume , the price point is excellent as the scent lasts all day a little goes a long way and i just love it !
4	the price here is better than walgreens this sunscreen is amazing !
5	love the peppermint there is a small sensation that you would expect from mint but you get clean , well conditioned hair
5	i have used lash primer before , but never saw the point i 've been using the blinc mascara for over three years now and decided to give the primer a try after reading the reviews what a difference ! it makes my lashes look thicker without looking clumped , as long as i do not over do it on the primer application my blinc mascara actually stays on for 24 hrs without flaking amazing
5	love the look of the nails doing a french design with this one as top color very pretty and durable
5	after having a chi burn the heck out of my hair and the frizz therapy flat iron working better than my chi did i swore i 'd never own another flat iron that cost 100 or more again then i saw this and decided i absolutely had to try it unlike any flat iron i 've ever used before , this one actually uses agave oil and the oil into your hair while flat ironing i was skeptical before trying it , but once i saw the difference it made i was sold it 's definitely worth every penny they are asking for it the first picture is my hair before flat ironing it 's actually not that bad of a frizz day if you can believe that the second picture is a section of hair that i did with the remington flat iron and the third picture is a different section of hair i did with this agave healing vapor iron the pictures do n't quite do it justice since you ca n't feel the hair through a picture or really see the actual amount of shine but the difference in person really is amazing first , i like that the flat iron comes with a back up oil reservoir in case the first one gets damaged this is the plastic reservoir that you pour the included oil into filling the reservoir is really easy and the directions were not at all hard to understand there is also a dial that allows you to adjust the heat settings so you can set the iron to the lowest setting that will work for your hair , preventing heat damage the cord is quite long and i was able to easily stand in the middle of my double vanity and move around while doing my hair , which is nice i do n't like being stuck near the wall just because the cord wo n't reach when you are using the flat iron you can actually see the agave oil coming out of the plate that has the reservoir on the outside of it , so you can see it working the oil itself is about 16 a bottle for replacement bottles , which is n't bad considering what i pay for some of my hair products and how soft and sleek my hair felt after using it overall i have to say i'm eating my words after having said i 'd never fall for believing that a 100 or more flat iron is better than a 50 remington while i would never go back to chi , this particular flat iron blew me away and you can really see and feel the difference it makes in your hair i 'd definitely recommend this to anyone who fights a daily battle with frizz or really anyone who wants to use a flat iron that actually seems to be good for your hair i personally have n't owned this long enough to notice issues with durability and longevity but will update my review as time goes on if i run into any issues
5	i 've not used a face primer before but i 've thought about it for some time this does n't actually add any color , but provides a nice surface for the rest of you makeup this is smooth and light and leaves the skin ever so soft for hours no irritation \( and i have very sensitive skin \) and no off putting fragrance added nice light product i'm very pleased with how this feels on my face
5	my significant other has problems with extra sensitive skin that always get red and irritated after shaving in addition , he is sensitive to scented products according to him , this vichy after shave balm is the first product he tried \( and , believe me , there have been many \) that really cuts down on the ugly red welts he gets on his face after shaving it cools down his skin , thereby helping to prevent razor burn , and it does so without using alcohol or any other ingredients that sting the skin because it is unscented , it is also safe for use by those who have scented product sensitivities i , personally , was really surprised at the reasonable price here on amazon many of the products he has tried have been very expensive , and then they did n't work for him this is a great product if you have skin problems after shaving , this vichy balm is definitely something i would recommend that you try i hope it works for you as well as it does for him
1	september update ultimately i was unable to continue using any of the products from jb emailed the company is more interested in taking your and refuse to refund any of my purchases even though i ca n't use any of them so not only was i brushed off but i was outright told i could not get a refund even though they push clients to use the products passed the 45 day refund period this company does not back their product they will encourage you to use something else on their line or continue using the acne kit , stating on the website , it can take several weeks \( i e well over a month \) to see if the purge will subside a good company would refund customers who are and having serious reactions to their products i will warn you now , buy it , but be aware that getting a refund will be nearly impossible if your have problems seems the good people at jb are too busy to address my issue with their product so i found it best to anyone thinking about trying this product of my experience thus far i 've been acne plagued for more than 2 count them 2 decades i 've tried everything with continued disappointment including anything my dermatologist recommended i decided to get this on a whim and the first week or so it seemed to show improvement now , many people say with a new product there may be a stage where the acne is cycling thru and eventually it 'll leave you with better looking skin thereafter so far my purge is the worst my acne has ever looked and is in places i 've never had acne how can that be \? one thing to tell me my regular acne or hidden acne will pop up faster during a purge , but explain the behind acne on parts of my face never seen \? my face has been completely ravaged and i'm on my 2nd month when i posted something with jb hoping to get assistance , i got nothing , , zip seems they were just more happy to have me into a 2nd month and did n't feel the need to help out someone who could potentially be a lifelong customer if this horrible purge ever passes because i'm pretty determined instead , i'm left to assume it 'll either get better in the next 30 days or i 'll need to go to another product if it improves i 'll keep it but as it 's looking \( which is pretty darn nasty at the moment \) i 'll likely their so called return policy again i just have to see if this purge is a or not i 've had similar breakouts , but nothing like this i 've used this regime religiously alas just getting worse for now all over my forehead \( never break out there \) , all over my jawline \( painful , scarring red patches on both sides \) , all around my lips i 've pretty much had to cut out make up most days because it makes it look like , uneven the product ok , the facewash is good does n't dry out your face the moment you towel it off smells kinda lemon to me nothing to write home about functional , more than enough to get you through several dozen washes the serum so far i'm not seeing any improvements related to the would be acne fighter a little goes a long way the lotion is mighty sticky , weird , very oil free so much so it 'll suck the surface of your skin dry i find my face is oilier in the middle of the day using this regime if it were really balancing it would n't be nearly like the oil slick that it is i have to constantly blot my acne prone , combination skin with those oil absorbing sheets did n't have to do that as often before i'm afraid by the time i finally grow out of my acne it 'll be time for wrinkle cream anyway , overall the product seems fine the only item out of the entire kit i 'd repurchase at this point considering i'm still in the dreaded purge is the facial peel i love the peel i could just about eat it out of the jar again , i use it as recommended and it seems to help the acne \( when applied at night \) the morning after when i awake the acne appears diminished then a couple days later i have a whole new crop of white and red to remind me this kit is n't working out very well be prepared to be by jb after they 've gotten your money because that 's how i feel i 'll consider my review at the end of next month i 'll be officially through two whole months we 'll see where my face is then august update ultimately , i gave up using this kit other than the peel and the blemish clearing stick \( which you 'd buy separately \) only using up what i have left of the peel as i 've found one made with similar ingredients for way less than what the standard jar costs and ounce for ounce the stick is n't exceptional the products overall , i'm sad to say , never completely eliminated my problem high cost no real results had it , obviously i would be raving about it and not complaining about the cost \( when you invest in the standard bottles \) when will these companies get that if something really works people will happily pay for it so long as it 's reasonable \? anyway , i gave up on the all natural toner have moved onto trying the clinique acne kit in hopes it may my acne beast but that 's a new regime for me and thus i ca n't say for sure how it 's going as of yet my jb purge was so damaging that my dark marks are still healing and i took a little break in between the kits by washing with mild facewash and spot treating additionally , i developed noticeable blackheads which i 'd never really had a problem with before jb ideally , i 'd like to think this jb kit could work for someone , but not if you have sensitive oily skin i'm my purge was my skin reacting poorly to the product however , many are vague as to how to distinguish between a reaction and a so called purge if the purge actually exists , you know therefore , i suggest if you are breaking out in places you typically do n't you may be having a poor reaction to something in the product if you are an oil slick 30 days into testing a new regime , you 're likely not to it well that was the case for me anyway
4	eat makeup remover works well on waterproof makeup as well my only hang up with this product is that it 's a bit messy one pump of the remover is plenty
4	super nice product goes on with a velvet feel to it and covers nicely 2 is just a tad dark for my complexion so i am going to order 1 my skin is very fair so i am passing this along to my significant other to use on his sunspots i have purchased many concealers over the years and so far , i like this one the best this is my first purchase of a japonesque product and if this is an indication of the quality , i will be ordering more items a definite recommend update , i ordered 1 and it is perfect for my complexion this covers well and feels velvety and creamy really pleased my sister tried it too and is ordering some for herself
1	not worth the money or claim tried a lot from this line and all the products are especially for the claim of less chemicals which are actually in them
5	my husband loves this product so much that i had to buy him one too ! it 's such a great sculpting tool and gives good hold on the hair but is n't tacky or sticky such a great product light weight and conditioning as well
5	this is my second ahava hand moisturizer like my first one , this one also has a beautiful and soothing smell to it the texture is soft and has a non greasy feel to it it 's very moisturizing i apply a thin layer of it on my dry hands overnight and wake up with very supple skin i love it !
5	this is an absolutely lovely scent the packaging is downright goofy , with its clunky square top bottom , though it does look kind of cool , in an odd , ish way the scent , though , is really wonderful it starts off at the light , fruity end of floral , but as it lingers you can detect a as well as a bit of powder heck , i do n't know what i'm talking about , but i do really like this eau de toilette spray , which lasts for hours in a pleasant way i would say it is appropriate for either gender
3	the color is a bit more brown than i expected but i like it i found i need to use a brush than the sponge tip to get a precise line my reason for only giving it 3 stars is how drying it is image if you will having every bit of moisture from your lips then drain another 8 oz and that 's how my lips feel when i wear this i 've found if i layer a similar shade over it \( in my case makeup forever \) i can tolerate it
4	smells wonderfully of lavender sometimes such scented bars of soap come in a tiny size but this is a full sized bar i would n't call it moisturizing nor is it in any way drying but it easily rinses free of your skin the smell is n't chemically and to me that 's the key to the in the name because the smell is so refreshing it 's expensive however which is the only reason i deducted a star and i had to force myself to do that
5	i 've been using this moisturizer morning and night for about a week now , and i 've never found a moisturizer i like better i have mostly been using cerave on the advice of my dermatologist , and washing my face with cetaphil , but that 's it as far as product on my face i have eczema that up around my mouth , nose , and eyes , and just about any product i try makes it flare up the cerave cetaphil combination kept my skin clean and somewhat moisturized and did n't make my face get red and flaky , and i thought that was the best i could hope for every once in awhile i would try another product , hoping to find something that worked better than , but always had problems until now after a week of use , i have noticeably fewer fine lines and less redness my skin feels softer and with my mirror reveals no flakiness the fine line reduction is as good as i had with my one try with a retinol product , but without the extreme redness and flakiness that showed up after three days of using retinol the redness i still struggle with a little , but it is much less , and considerably less blotchy and noticeable even my 11 year old son noticed my face was less red you do n't use very much the product comes with a tiny spoon , but honestly even that little spoon holds more than you need i barely touch my finger to the surface and then dot that around my face twice , and that is plenty so even though this is by no means cheap , it 's going to last awhile and it 's so effective that it 's worth it very happy !
5	always use after i wash my hair leaves my hair smelling wonderful and shiny also helps with styling my hair as well
5	love it the only negative for some , may be that it seems to fade quicker than perfumes , but it is a toilette spray , and not as concentrated as a perfume i actually prefer the toilette over another that is so strong that i ca n't stand to wear it until i rinse it off my wrists and allow what 's left to linger on my skin i am very sensitive to most chemicals and other and fragrances this is one of the first that i have not only been able to tolerate , but that i actually like ! both my son 's , 16 21 even sniff tested for me and liked it , as well as our highly sensory daughter she loved it ! we even put a spritz on a couple of her favorite animals so she could enjoy it too beautiful , soft , sexy and playful love it ! \( reviewed by my wife , i do n't use perfume much \)
5	works perfectly ! i have this one and the bubble bath one and they work no doubt this is clear and spreads smoothly smoother than the bubble bath nail strengthener i use this first and then apply a base coat within a week , i noticed a huge difference my nails feel firmer and stronger definitely will recommend to everyone gals and guys
5	this is a great set ! it has a few products i have n't tried before i do wish there was more of a theme to it , but it 's apparently their best sellers so oh well still a great set !
4	been using this about a week now i like it it is very moisturizing and you can feel it sink in i think my skin looks better , fresher i 've been using clarins double serum for last couple years , guerlain and channel serums prior \( i use after cleansing , after moisturizing day cream \) this seems a little pricey but probably because i 'd never heard of this brand before cost wise , it 's about in the middle so far the only negative \( thus 4 stars \) is that the pump does not distribute both contents equally at each pump there is a light yellowish cream and a color more opaque that come out separately pump in your hand , then i rub together and then smooth over face i like this , but i expect perfection for high end products if looking for very nice serum , under moisturizer , try this one btw , was happy to review this item since i use anti aging serums \( and i think they work ! \)
5	i loooove essie polishes they wear great , do n't chip , and have dozens and dozens of colors you ca n't find anywhere else this color is vibrant and has the tiniest and i mean tiny amount of sparkle to it it is a great go to color for when you ca n't decide at the salon for all ages ! \) i highly recommend this one , ladies \)
5	feels great
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	i saw this color at the salon and knew i had to have it i got a pedicure with it at the salon , and when i applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter , but i actually like it better like that i used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle
5	looks to me like la roche posay c eyes anti wrinkle product will be a great hit everywhere they did it again ! this is the third product that i have reviewed for this company but i hope it is not the last i am really impressed with their improvement of my skin i shall continue to use them now that i know they are worth the money they cost i do n't have the worst wrinkles on my eyelids and under the eyes but i'm probably not far off but i am retired , live in a community but i'm not dead i still like to get dressed up for lunch \( called dinner here \) and fixing my face is more fun than pre noon tv shows i have used expensive and i 've used less costly eye creams i love the shadows i use \( also from amazon \) but i do want some kind of beforehand moisture on these old eyes this works great ! it 's light not gooey no fragrance did i notice and shadows go on so smoothly i almost feel 70 again ! this might seem a little pricey but the amount you use is minute i shall try to keep track of how many days before i have to re order and i bet it will be at least six months that cuts the cost down great product let 's go see what else they make !
5	being a woman of a certain age , i have tried many , many under eye creams that are supposed to help reduce the signs of aging very few , if any deliver on this strivectin ar advanced retinol eye cream is one of those eye creams that delivers ! you only need a little bit moisturize with your chosen overall day or night moisturizer then take a small dab and dab under your eye area with your ring finger for the lightest pressure in this very fragile part of your skin you will notice results almost immediately ! i was very pleasantly surprised ! this one is definitely a keeper !
4	i'm a big fragrance connoisseur as i have over 20 bottles in my fragrance cabinet ranging from , versace , lacoste , to my personal favorite , gucci i'm very particular about my scents and was not a big fan of ck as i felt as though they were the penny of fragrances however , obsession has given me pause as i find it 's rich and elegant scents to be rather complimenting i like to categorize my fragrances into sections such as sport , fresh , executive , etc and i find obsession to fall into the executive category as it feels like a mature scent without of old man like old english leather obsession starts out very potent and smells but , after a few minutes , mellows out and leaves a very mature scent behind that lasts for much of the day i work in retail during my days and i found that three sprays \( arms and neck \) lingers pleasantly for an entire 8 hour shift \( including lunch \) to the point where my fianc notices the scent when i get home from work while i still prefer other scents such as nautica voyage and armani code , ck 's obsession is a great addition to any fragrance connoisseur 's collection as it superbly blends mature scents without coming across as old
5	very gentle facial cleanser i only needed to use about a dime size , and it lathered up nicely it 's not harsh , and felt good against my skin there is a scent to it , but it 's not overpowering product is made in the usa

5	love essie 's nail colors this is a perfect color of red not to bright but very soft had a hard time finding it in stores thanks to a amazon you can find anything
5	exc purchase
2	this was pretty disappointing i 've had luck with similar products so i was certain that it would cover up a small birthmark it might work well under your eyes , but it did not offer enough coverage for the birthmark i applied it correctly , even trying different techniques such as stippling , using a little , using a lot , reapplying nothing worked that pesky little oversized freckle was still staring at me
5	i have been using this now for a month , i apply every five days and my legs look nice and tan which is impressive i have pretty white legs as well i was sent a mitt to use as well , i think that really helps in application i also exfoliate between applying in the shower and that helps ensure the tan is even i have n't used on my arms yet as i am pretty sloppy with application and afraid i will have white inner elbows but saving the rest for the spring a really nice self tanning product !
5	foremost , if your skin can handle a primer \( and some people with very sensitive skin cannot always do this \) , try a light amount of primer before applying this this it will minimize pores and make the product go on smoothly now , this is the the real deal it is genuinely full coverage therefore , if possible , apply extremely lightly then use a beauty blender to blend and , keep blending then , apply just a little extra with a brush to areas that require more attention \( a tattoo , a blemish , a birthmark , etc \) then gently blend that \( especially around the edges \) use a loose translucent powder to set this put it on with a dusting of a brush if you have dry to normal skin if you skin is oily , gently press it on with a powder puff you can achieve a natural look if you build the coverage very slowly and very carefully take your time with this and you will be very surprised
5	best eyeshadow ever !
5	works great , less harsh than pure acetone
4	no scent , is an amazing cleaner and does n't feel oily when applied the only reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because it separates very quickly i was surprised how much of my makeup this oil cleanser removed and it did n't leave my skin feeling oily at all i'm not used to spending 30 00 on a cleanser for my face , but this one is worth it
4	the violet is my fav flavor but this brand is the best !
3	it does the job , and covers well however , it tends to come off on your pillowcases it does n't stain , but it is annoying
5	very dark dark purple plum color like the skin of a dark plum fruit no sparkle or pearl sheen it is on my toes as i type great for fall but really anytime silver glimmer on top makes it pop experiment have fun no rule book for nail looks
1	feels silky but looked like pancake makeup on me also extremely light in color \( i'm very fair , but this was white ish \) love the effaclar line , but this one was a total bust
5	this came at just the right time working in our garden i got a bug bite in the middle of my forehead that left a large red , but dermablend camouflages it almost completed easy to apply and blend , great coverage
2	i 'll be honest that i selected this item from the vine program mostly for the serum and less for the face clearing since i do n't really have acne , just the occasional breakout the problem i have is that every time i do get a blemish , the spot , even when healed takes forever to fade and i have been looking for something that fades and evens out those spots i decided to try the whole system and after the first use , i have opted not to use it again first , the smell is unpleasant , or at least it was to me perhaps extended use would work wonders for the skin , but i am unable to stomach the smell so that 's something i used the cleanser , serum and moisturizer , just as in the instructions after the first and only use , my skin felt dry with an odd texture hard to explain , not exactly smooth or silky or very sticky \( just a little sticky \) , just weird then i started to itch and feel tingling not good tingling , more burning , rashy tingling nothing that i 'd ever want to feel again i did not try the peel , one whiff and i felt i will use the bamboo washcloth again , however it 's really great so while this may have long term benefits , i am unable \( unwilling \) to re use this i urge every potential buyer to read all reviews before purchasing this product although some people used this with good results , the manufacturer does not seem like it cares or is customer friendly or even willing to help those people who had legitimate customer service issues i cannot recommend this product
2	well it feels nice \) but i have very sensitive skin and it made me break out right away first night i wish i could use it smells great , feels great but pimples \)
5	butter london has once again met and exceeded all my expectations this polish color is just as vibrant as it appears butter london 's colors are always rich and beautiful in person all what i really love about their nail polish is the fact that is does n't have any of the horrible smells that many of the other brands have because they cut out those chemicals the polish does n't destroy the nail like many other products and is always easy to remove and applies smoothly and thickly two coats is perfect if you have n't tried their polish before i highly recommend it !
5	love this ! i use it twice a day and it 's a nice hydrator i use the hydrating serum for days when my skin is super dry
4	i really really like this brand but finding just the right shade can be a bit tricky especially in summer with a tan i thought this would do the trick but it 's just a hint darker than hoped still the same great coverage , easy to apply and non irritating format i would absolutely buy this again in the future just going with a slightly lighter shade
3	i liked this polish , but i'm not sure it really did what it said and what i wanted it to do i expected it to color correct without a lot of additional color , but it really did come out looking very lavender , even after a top coat with another polish in this collection i like it well enough , but i'm disappointed that it did n't work as expected
3	unfortunately , this cleanser did n't get my face clean enough i ended up going back to this one https smile amazon com gp product ref oh search \? ie utf8 1
1	15 , 2015 class action law suit filed by 200 plus women having experienced bald patches ! ! ! !
5	this product has changed my life i feel so much confidence since i 've had it i was tired of people looking at the back of my balding head and the top this adds hair fibers to existing hair it covers everything on my balding head sometimes it takes some time in the morning to do just like you have regular hair you have to get a hang of the pepper shaker style i have tried the other tools they offer , but as a bald person that just seems to not work as well the pump just blows powder all over most people do n't even notice there 's a difference , and they think i just dyed my hair i sleep with it at night and leave it on for almost about a week \( 5 days \) then it starts to get a little itchy has to be touched up everyday i spray w hair spray n blow it w blower to hold i have read that you can get it wet and when i go in the shower it does n't seem to come out right away but i have n't quite tested that theory out yet also cut it when trimming up like real hair it 's worth the try for any guy n gal , n would be excellent for guys w hair but thinning
5	as it 's designed for rough skinned feet , this cream is far richer than ahava mineral hand cream , and so one needs less of it for one 's hands i love this luxurious cream try some
5	perfect color for the holidays !
5	i love the la roche posay pigmentclar dark circle eye cream so far because it 's thick and easily absorbed you need just a bit and it blends in quite well it does n't leave a slick residue on my top lids like my other eye cream i'm glad because it 's easier to apply eye shadow over this product i have some sun spots near my eyes since eye creams do n't come with spf ! that i 'd like to lighten i'm hoping the ingredient phe resorcinol in this product will help with these spots since they 're touted with lightening melanin i 'll update as i use this more in the meantime , it blends in easily and feels smooth and well absorbed the one thing i do n't care for is the chrome tip \( as seen in the photo \) that you are supposed to use to dab the cream on your eye it 's ice cold and entirely unpleasant for me i just use my finger my guess is that the phe resorcinol takes more than a week to begin lightening i have another product i used for melasma , and that took about a month to see marked differences i was doing a study for skin cream , and the could n't believe the differences from the month before so i 'll give this a month
1	i have had nothing but problems with this polish it 's streaky no matter how many coats or how much seche top coat i use it 's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy
4	this is a light and airy cream that works well over other moisturizers or on its own i found that it had a very slight floral scent that caused me not to be able to put it on my face for worry about the fragrance it is a very mild scent the lotion blends in easily without using a sticky residue
4	pretty color !
5	i believe this target is targeted mainly toward men , but i wanted to try it as it seems like i never get a close enough shave with feminine shaving products i used it on my legs which seems to always have a little bit of stubble left no matter what razor or shaving cream i use i have to say this product does what it says it will do the shave was the closest i 've ever experienced and my legs were baby smooth i let my boyfriend try it on his face and he was just as pleased this is a product i will purchase for both my and my man 's use on a regular basis
5	i love night cream it 's so light and fluffy ! ! it 's just the right weight for a light night cream ! ! great seller easy quick to get ! !
3	identical review as the one i gave for the eye cream concerned it was n't sealed as the one i purchased at my doctor 's office the cost savings was nice though
5	this is the only makeup my rosecea skin will tolerate
5	love the texture and quality of this product in providing moisture to your skin care regimen i am a 57 and find that as i get older my skin needs more moisture and this product does the job this is the second purchase as i first bought it from my esthetician for 62 and found it online for 33 which included shipping
5	this is my holy grail essential item to keep handy i do n't break out too often but when i do , they are usually enormous and in the worst spot this drying lotion has tamed even my worst breakouts overnight if it does n't completely disappear in a day , it is significantly reduced in size and redness , making it much much easier to conceal and it does all of this without over drying the skin it does have a strong odor to it , but once dried it becomes unnoticeable i use a q tip to apply it by just the q tip straight into the bottle without mixing it around , then apply it straight to the blemish and go to sleep i ca n't tell you what a life saver this has been especially when you have any big events coming up that require a clear face asap
1	disappointed very over priced water !
5	excellent
3	i thought this was just an okay product it was n't anything special and definitely not worth the listed price it 's a gel product and gives a soft hold my sons have wavy hair that need some type of hair product in it to keep it from getting very messy throughout the day i 've been putting this in their hair and it gives a soft , pliable hold it 's not a strong hold and does n't really hold their hair in place but it gives a controlled body i think the hairstyle that you apply it too would really depend on whether you liked the product or not i was expecting a product that would really hold their hair in place but it did n't i also tried the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baxter of california hard cream pomade 2 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 baxter of california hard cream pomade , 2 oz a nbsp and the of the two products are different but we got the same results from both
5	this feels absolutely luxurious when you put it on , and it smells delicate and heavenly i love the experience , and this is one of my favorite lotions precisely because it feels and smells so wonderful in the interest of transparency , i did n't notice a difference in terms of moisture and ashy dry skin relief between this and pond 's , l'oreal , or vaseline there seemed to be some difference in terms of firmness , which i obviously like if you 're looking for a spa like experience , this will do it if you 're just looking for a moisturizer , you 'll probably be just as happy with another option personally , i love it
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	i love essie nail polish and this will be a favorite of mine it looks like turquoise and that is my favorite color
4	works well
1	my wife was looking forward to getting this product however , when it arrived and she was able to get the ingredient list she decided that this would be what she would uses
4	this lipstick is a pretty shade it 's a sort of neutral red , possibly leaning towards cool tones it looks really nice on my skin , which has definite pink undertones for me , it 's on the very edge of what 's acceptable wear for work probably the darkest color i could get away with in a professional environment lasting power is pretty good it held for 3 4 hours , which is not bad , especially as i usually have something to drink in that time this lipstick is described as moisturizing , and i think that 's taking things a bit far it was n't especially drying , but it did not feel moisturizing at all so , not my favorite lipstick , but pretty , and i enjoy wearing it
2	i found this product to be frustrating , not terrible but not worth the high price firstly it the packaging sin of having twice as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up there is literally no reason for it to be in that size box , except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting it has a very strong , distinctive smell which i personally did not prefer for my face it lingers because the serum is an oil base , so you still get whiffs of the smell long after you 've applied it it takes a while to sink in due to the oily nature of the product while i think this allows for a good concentration of the hyaluronic acid component , it 's a little unpleasant if you accidentally touch your face before it 's absorbed i strongly dislike this brand 's lack of a transparent disclosure of ingredients i want to know exactly what i'm putting on my face this information is severely lacking they say that it 's hyaluronic acid and oil , but that 's it i'm sure there are other additives
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	i love this cream i have very sensitive skin , and have had allergic reactions to sooooo many skin care products avene was recommended to me , and it is wonderful it absorbs well , has no order , and leaves my face hydrated , soft , and glowing it contains no parabens , , etc
5	i love the korres lip butters and own 4 different shades this smells really nice kind of sugary and is really moisturizing it has a slight tint , but looks very natural
3	juicy couture hollywood is a nice , fresh fragrance , not too heavy and a little flirty i think it would appeal to younger people the bottle itself held promise but totally under delivered the painted plastic arrived cracked and with very rough edges it does not look nice in person , more of a child 's fake perfume bottle for dress up the bottle itself is glass and heavy , they should have just gone with an top and left the rest plain the perfume is worth it , the bottle ruins it if you can find the same scent in regular packaging , i 'd suggest that over this
4	this shampoo is nice and creamy , makes a wonderful lather and really left my hair soft i have very fine hair and as i have gotten older there 's less of it ugh this shampoo does seem to work in making my hair feel thicker lots of shampoos like this coat the hair shaft which is fine with me if it adds volume and thickness to my otherwise thinning hair
4	i have very fine hair , but a lot of them as such , my hair tends to be frizzy when not covered in some kind of smoothing lotion or or flat ironed i have a small flat iron that i use on occasion to make my hair soft and shiny a lot of the other time i simply slather on smoothing lotion or other product or choose to tie it up somehow i am not a hair expert and really do n't enjoy spending too much time with styling products and devices however , this one seemed very easy to use and i was n't wrong i started with freshly washed , dry hair it is shoulder length i pinned up half and put the brush temperature on i took sections and brushed in an upward motion starting as close to the scalp as possible in 10 minutes , my entire head was smoother and my hair more full looking i used the brush to give a small curl at the bottoms and around my face this styling brush is easy to use i plugged it in , pressed the button until i reached the desired temperature i waited for the lights to stop flashing , which meant it was fully heated \( it was approx 2 3 minutes from cold to hot \) i also enjoy that it comes with a velcro wrap to keep the cord managed and a heat resistant storage pocket with closure for travel if you have coarse or very curly hair , i am not sure if this would be the appliance for you it worked on my hair because each hair is very fine , although i have a lot i also would n't recommend to anyone looking for tight curls or big defined curls this is great for smoothing , light waves at the end of the hair and adding some volume from the roots
5	i 've used two different colors of dermablend 's quick fix concealer and found both to have nice coverage and both were easy to apply both colors matched my expectations based on the names i'm happy with this
4	it has nice , creamy sage green color the bottle i received probably sat for quite some time , it did not have liquid texture as most new polishes do i had to thin this out before using on my nails it does not contain big and that is a plus
5	the color works for my wife one just has to match their desired color against the color image on the product page to know about color it 's easy to apply , a little goes pretty far once it 's warmed up it can be warmed up by using one 's fingers and creating motion either between thumb and finger or with circular motions on facial skin coverage is good for covering freckles and the like and of course since it has titanium dioxide , it 's a sunscreen
5	i'm still a relative newbie to self tanning lotions , though i do love getting a sunless tan at a local salon so i'm pretty familiar with the type of results you achieve and how long it lasts this was also my second time trying a xen tan product so this time , i was a little more comfortable with application and more familiar with the brand itself the big selling point for this tanning lotion is that it looks natural ' and having tried it , i have to agree in general i do think self tanning products have improved a lot since i initially with them in my teens the results then were enough to scare me away for years since the results were very orange and streaky the results of this product , to my eye , look much less orange and closer to a real tan i 've actually been impressed with how close the color is to what i get when i go the higher end self tanning salon in chicago where the tanner is airbrushed on by a professional what i do prefer though about having it done there vs with this product at home is that i generally opt for the clear solution that has no bronzer mixed in that means i do n't have to worry about getting color on my clothes or furniture while i wait for the tan to set at home though i do think the added bronzer is necessary to help you keep track of where you 've applied and where you have n't \( if my experience with sunscreen is any indication i would probably miss spots otherwise \) my solution to this has generally been to a blanket or towel over any furniture and to wear lose fitting clothes i can wash thankfully i'm also going for a lighter tan so i generally only leave this on for an hour of other things i appreciate , the smell is mild and totally pleasant and it 's easy enough to apply this with a mitt , though i do get some help from my boyfriend for my back and other hard to reach places overall i think this is great product and a perfect option if you want a natural looking sunless tan at home
3	this product smells lovely and in general i like the bliss product line however , i have not noticed any difference in my skin reduction in fine lines after using for over a month the glitter in the product is what i notice more than benefit or effect for the price i will not be repurchasing
4	i love this oil its moisturizing without feeling greasy it does feel oily on the skin but that is n't the same as greasy i actually like the feel of the oil on my skin , it feels like my makeup glides on easier the oil is very moisturizing and makes my skin feel great the oil contains shea butter , jojoba oil , macadamia seed oil , passion flower oil , oil , and rosehip oil it also contains vitamin c and orchid extract it also makes a good carrier in which to mix other ingredients if they are powders or other creams that you use i also use a vitamin c powder and it mixes wonderfully with the oil i would give it 5 stars if not for the price i do n't think this is something i would purchase on a continuing basis because of the price
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	i love this product it is like a mouse texture and goes on super easily love it highly recommend it only wish it had sunscreen
4	i like this top coat , it keeps nail polish clear and in place it 's easy to spread to make a thin coat
5	normally when i do the shellac process i use negligee for my nails it is not clear but translucent i was looking for something that might be closer to clear and in reading the reviews thought this might actually be it and so it is while it does have a slight pink tinge to it going on , i find that when dried under the uv light it is quite clear with no pink tinge at all it is perfect for what i wanted but if you are wanting it to show up pink you might be disappointed i also believe that the coloration and texture of an individuals nails might make this show up more pink in my case , it is totally clear
5	love this product
5	this is an absolutely lovely fragrance the floral and sandalwood notes are easiest to pick up on , and they blend together nicely for a inoffensive scent that should do well year without feeling too light in winter or too cloying in summer this is a great fragrance for business use as it does n't project far from the wearer if they do n't bathe in it it is a pleasing scent that most anyone of any age should be able to enjoy
3	needs a white base color , regardless still a nice shade
5	my favorite new shade for summer ! turns out gorgeous and bright even without a white base could n't be happier with it !
5	this moisturizer absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling smooth i have a tendency to break out with some facial creams and fortunately this moisturizer does n't cause any problem with my skin at this point in my life i have some very oily places and very dry places on my face and i like the fact that i get the moisture i need in the right places , without making the oilier places worse overall , it is great product that goes on well , absorbs quickly , and leaves my skin soft
5	this is oh so pretty ! love it ! goes on great ! beautiful matte finish i did pay a steep price of 20 00 the price listed is half of what i paid sadly
4	i had never used oribe products previously , but knew the name and wanted to try it out it is a very thick conditioner , and a little goes a long way it smells absolutely amazing , with the scent probably being my favorite part of it it rinses out easily , leaving my hair soft and shiny , but not greasy or weighed down i'm not sure how fifty dollar conditioner is supposed to work , as this is my first foray into this price point , but i would imagine it should do all the things a drugstore brand does , plus make you feel like you are doing something luxurious oribe 's intense conditioner easily checks all those boxes , and has luxury in
4	em phan finishing powder is great for younger women it is a matte finishing powder and does n't have enough for the older woman you can wear this finishing powder alone , over makeup or use it as a touch up throughout the day to blot shine the mirrored compact is very nice if i hold it sideways , it reflects almost my entire face the applicator is thin foam about 1 8 thick will dry quickly whenever you need to wash it i received bare 4 instead of porcelain 02 i would describe bare 4 as between light medium ivory
4	understand that this tria laser tool is a collagen , is not a drink from the fountain of youth , and you may fall in love with it because of what it actually does successfully do results are not instantaneous , but require weeks of consistent treatment , so when people say it is all that and a bag of chips , what they see in the mirror is what they wish to see that being said , this tool appears to do what it claims to do , stimulate the collagen which plumps up slight wrinkles in facial skin over bone , and anything else is a byproduct of the attention the user is likely also giving to their skin while using the tria try the tria on your cleansed and dried off forearm to be sure you recognize the prickly sensation that will be felt on the face use it on a cleansed and dried off face , avoiding the eyes , staying on areas that cover bone , following a four sectioned or order i have found that as suggested in the tria online video , i prefer to move the device vertically along my forehead area and along the remaining three zones i then use a facial serum and moisturizer to rehydrate the skin and i drink a glass of water to rehydrate my interior it is suggested to perform this ritual five out of seven nights a week prior to bed for twelve weeks , raising the stimulation from one to three as you can tolerate the sensation stimulation is increased with the levels as is the timing for zone my sensitive skin showed no adverse reaction at any stage , that is no redness , darkening or burning i also religiously apply sunscreen during the day and would do this if i did nothing else to my face this is a good tool and becomes easier to use over time because it becomes second nature to move the laser area along the face for the first few nights , i found that i had difficulty getting it to move smoothly and if it did not touch the skin , the laser stopped working initially , that was frustrating , then i discovered that by that my skin was completely dry after being cleansed and then carefully regulating the pressure with which i moved it across my face , the two minute treatment went by as quickly as the two minute cycle of my electric toothbrush like my toothbrush , the tria me when a zone is completed at each unlike the toothbrush , this turns itself off at the end of a treatment cycle i can lock the device and then unlock it by holding down the power button for a few seconds , a safety feature i appreciate my tria arrived with no lotions or potions , just the device , charging cradle , usb cord for the and plug for the usb cord enclosed was a little purple containing the instruction manual this tool is not cheap and considering the battery is expected to last perhaps three years tops , it is not for everyone if you typically spend a substantial amount of money on skin care products , and spas , i wo n't advise against trying this as for me , the true test will be hearing what my dermatologist says at my next visit the tria wo n't rid my skin of the effects of time , age and sun damage , but if it continues to help plump up those tiny wrinkles with my own collagen , i'm not complaining
5	came on time and worked fine
5	so , as i was searching the internet one night for a product to help my adult cystic acne , i came across these glycolic acid treatment pads the reviews were great , and they were also supposed to help with fine lines and wrinkles ! i was very skeptical for sure , but i was also desperate , so i ordered them after one week of using this product , i noticed my pores were definitely not as noticeable and my acne was greatly improving ! i was still thinking there 's no way this product is this great ! i also noticed that my skin looked brighter and healthier as well so , i was nearing the end of the jar , and i began to notice that my forehead lines were softening and my laugh lines were also not as noticeable as before i was officially sold on this product ! not only had it basically cleared up my skin \( aside from a hormonal related pimple here and there near my cycle \) , but my skin also appeared so much more youthful ! i am so excited about this product and hope that everyone suffering from adult acne will give it a shot ! i know everyone 's skin is different , and what worked for me may not work for everyone however , this product will help exfoliate and cleanse the dirt and grime away from your skin no matter what so , it definitely wo n't hurt to try , and it 's a great value as well i am definitely singing the praises of my new found go to product for acne and wrinkles ! this product may cause stinging when you first begin to use it , especially if you have never used glycolic acid products before if you have sensitive skin , it may be best to start with either this strength \( 15 \) or the 10 to allow your skin to get used to the glycolic acid before moving up to the higher 20 strength the burning and tingling does n't last long , and you will begin to notice that it does n't seem to burn after using it several times bottom line try these if you 're looking for something to help rid you of stubborn adult acne , or if you 're simply looking for something to help with anti aging or to help with wrinkles that have already formed this product really is great !
5	top of the line immediate results
5	the honey beige is a bit too dark for my skin , but in the summer it 's not as noticeable i will not downgrade this product because of that the liquid comes out evenly and applies easily , evening out my skin 's tone it 's non irritating and non fragranced this product reminds me of dermablend and how it reacts to my skin the skin looks fresh for several hours after application when indoors
2	color is nice but liked better that has a beautiful gloss finish
5	works great even when i sweat
5	we never had an issue with cradle cap ! i strongly believe it 's because we washed our little guy 's head with this shampoo a few times a week strongly recommend
5	ok , i 'll admit when i ordered this , i missed the part where this was for men but then i thought well men are human are n't they \? and humans have skin , right \? and decided to rub it on to my own freshly scrubbed face what i learned was it is non greasy it leaves skin satin smooth it feels soothing \( i had a bit of sun from yard work \) it is not strongly scented then i gave it to my husband \( the actual target market \) and his thoughts were what my wife wrote above has a scent but very light and inoffensive his skin looked less red and angry that he likes it and will continue to use it we both have very sensitive skin and had zero problems with this did it erase wrinkles \? sort of , skin looks smoother only time will tell if it actually erases wrinkles
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
3	i'm on the fence about cuticle removers , in general this is n't a bad product there 's not a warning that tells you you can only leave it on for 8 minutes before you need to wash it off generally , it works it softens cuticles but this may be a result of moisture vs the product i do have other cuticle remover creams which seem to do a better job of getting rid of cuticles
5	works great spend 2 3 extra minutes in morning getting ready for work and bye bye bald spot love it ! ! !
4	this serum works very well , but it is very highly priced i really like the twist open feature , which really has nothing to do with how well this product works this goes on nice and easy i think that at my current rate i 'll be able to at least get a couple of months out of this product so far , i'm noticing reduced wrinkles , especially in the forehead i 'll probably continue to use this product if i can fit it into my budget overall , i'm liking the results after a few weeks of usage
2	i received 3 pairs of these eye gels in a gift basket , have now used them all and wo n't be buying more they 're easy to apply and remove , feel cooling and refreshing , and did wake me up a bit but firming and de as they say \? nope i used my 3 sets once each in the morning , midday , and before bed no difference in performance so , nothing special here to justify the cost a eye mask , cold washcloth , or cucumber would work just as well or better
5	i 'll be darned it really works dark circles \( decades old \) are diminished , all but gone ! and fast it 's remarkable
2	calvin klein eternity was a fragrance i used quite regularly in the mid 1990 's i was so happy to receive a sample to test for review and revisit an old friend unfortunately this is not the same fragrance i remember the original eternity was a distinctive sexy , clean , floral scent that is hard to forget this new formula is musky , masculine and made me nauseous after wearing it for a few minutes i had to take a shower to lose this scent and feel better this had me curious enough to research this further , after all maybe its just me perhaps i do n't remember the scent or my body chemistry has changed nope , turns out this was sold to coty in and the formula was changed anyone searching for the original eternity will need to search for vintage bottles for sale i'm very disappointed in the changes to the one time beautiful scent i ca n't wear this , i no longer like the scent and i certainly do n't want to feel sick all day
5	this is a wonderful body cream , it is indeed a very sensual i do n't care for strong overwhelming smells so i am very happy it is not overpowering my skin is a bit on the dry side and it leaves me feeling very soft and smooth i especially enjoying rubbing a bit on my hands before bed so i keep it on my night stand where it doubles as a home security weapon the jar is heavy lol this comes in a beautiful glass jar and a wonderful pretty box that would make gift wrapping unnecessary if you ever purchase this as a gift for some one its a bit pricey and depending on how you use it it may not last as long in the end a little goes long way and it feels and smells divine very light and floral !
5	very pretty color
5	wife 's review i am currently pregnant and my skin is a mess i have hyperpigmentation , acne , dry oily areas i do n't typically use new skin products when i'm having such trouble with my skin , but i figured it could n't get much worse and wow , was i ecstatic about the results ! my acne started clearing up , hyperpigmentation spots are less prominent , and over all my skin is brighter and firmer after use and i 've only been using it 2 weeks ! i 've used so many expensive and various brands of skin products that i 've lost count i 've never had such obvious and fast results before this is very pricey , but if the results stick , i would certainly purchase
5	its wonderful
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	good product i bought these to use before micro dermabrasion and they work well for that not too harsh the only issue i have with them is that they are very thin and hard to separate i always end up having to handle a second pad to get the first i worry about contamination since the second pad goes back in the jar and sits there for a few days
4	i like the color i have pale skin with pink undertones , and this works well as a bright , pinky red shade like the line , it applies easily \( a tiny bit of bubbling for me with this color \) , dries super fast , and lasts
5	nice color
5	love this always have on my bathroom shelf from march october most natural self tan i 've ever used plus no mess and no baked smell truly an excellent product
4	an excellent cleanser , which leaves my skin feeling clean , slightly dry , but not dry you do n't need to use much , which is fortunate because this is a pricey cleanser i doubt it stays on the skin long enough to do anything about dark spots
5	love ! i was and am always looking for my hg cosmetic items and trust me , i have a lot of cosmetics , but i am always buying more and more and more this has a silky feel , i love the colors , and on me , it gives this beautiful hint of color with a built in i am blonde and kinda a medium \( not totally fair \) but am not pasty white , tho i do have color to me this is just a gorgeous product i ordered 3 colors i am tempted to order all of them !
5	mine arrived in perfect condition , with a mirrored compact that is simple but elegant i like the vincent longo compacts the blush is also in one like this because they stack so well in my makeup and they do n't take up any extra room i thought that beige 3 might be a tad too dark for me , as i am fair , and it says that shade is for fair to medium , but it turned out to be just right this is a powder that is easy to layer to get the effect wanted , and i think that is why the color is so forgiving looking at it , it is made of multiple shades that blend together as the product is used , whether with a brush or with the included plush applicator it goes on and with even just a light application , it quickly gets rid of shine anywhere it is placed , giving skin a nice even , matte tone you can also use a brush with it i found the applicator that was included perfect for me when i was going without foundation , and just wanted to use this powder with foundation , a brush gives a more sheer layer of coverage the color does deepen though if you layer it , so for me i found that 2 layers of powder give the lighter aspect of the powder , but if i build it , i start to see darker color i liked that the color stayed true all day no orange or off tones developed at all in pleasant temperatures when i have not had a lot of sweating , the color lasted me for many hours it does n't settle in fine lines at all i am very happy with how long it lasts here 's a tip for anyone who breaks a compact they love if you have some very strong drinking alcohol , like 180 proof , just mix the powder with a bit of the alcohol , go across the top with a flat surface , like a silicone bowl scraper , pressing down and off , so the surface is flat , and let it dry the alcohol will evaporate and your compact will be in pressed form again i am always carrying compacts in my purse and then dropping my purse it happens to the best of makeup , and that 's my goto fix i 've saved many a powder eyeshadow , blush , or foundation powder like that i have n't had any problems at all with this one cracking or breaking up though it has been great
5	amazing color i love it
5	i am a makeup artist i have tried a lot of different makeup from drugstore to professional brands one of the things that is very handy to have is something for the body if you need to cover a scar , discoloration , or a tattoo although i have some makeup that will do a good job , often it takes some time for application what i was looking for was something quick and easy in a pinch to use on those days when a full careful application is just not possible due to time what is this foundation stick like \? like the old bell lip smackers in the large tube , this body foundation is a very thick stick that comes in a tube with a cap on it the foundation that i am reviewing is color also called honey the foundation itself is similar to mac 37c but a little bit pinker in the summer this color is very close to my tanned skin since this is a body cover up stick , it is perfect how to apply i find that this is best applied over moisturized skin it blends into the skin best when it has been moisturized and prepared for the makeup however , quick applications sometimes do not allow for pampering , so i also tested this on skin in emergency situations in both situations i applied directly to the skin and then blended the edges i put powder on top to set the makeup and then brushed off the powder when i say powder , i mean powder that is the same color as my skin i have also used a translucent powder which does not show up at all how does this makeup perform \? on surfaces that are uneven such as a scab , scar , or other skin problem , this takes some layers to cover you will still see the uneven nature of the skin , but it blends it nicely into the skin so it is not as obvious anymore as far as full coverage , if i apply very thickly , it will eventually start to come off due to the nature of the thick application with a few thin layers built up , it works better with dark discoloration , bruising , or tattoos i have to say that this does not cover completely having said that , i find that using a corrector on the skin first which is the opposite in tone to the discoloration , i am able to tone down the discoloration nicely then when i put this foundation on top carefully with fingers or a damp sponge , it does cover a lot better for instance , if the large spot is red in nature , then a green corrector lightly applied on top will neutralize that discoloration so that when you put the foundation stick over that , it will be a little easier to cover other corrector colors you might need if you have a deep red or purple area , for instance , try using a yellow corrector for grey or brownish areas a pink corrector is usually best for bluish areas you are covering up , a soft orange neutral corrector is usually helpful how does this wear \? in cooler weather , it wears nicely there are not any problems with it coming off or melting off as a really hot sweaty day might offer if it rubs on clothing or something , it will wear off some and has to be reapplied the stick is easy to carry , however , so that is not a huge problem in hot humid sticky weather , this is a little harder to keep in place , but it still works nicely i just try to keep the stick handy if possible , but not in the car , as it will melt and cause problems with the foundation stick i also found that this stick was not dry or cake like it does sometimes have to be reapplied so be prepared to carry it with you in very important situation if at all possible the bottom line convenient , portable , and easy to use , this body foundation stick does a decent job of covering body imperfections quickly and especially when a careful pampered application is just not possible it covers most things well and very dark things with a bit of corrector first wear depends on the day sometimes i get a full day , sometimes i need reapplication my rating all in all , this is a decent foundation to have handy i would suggest if you really like having this on hand that you purchase two colors one that blends with your summer skin and one for winter which is usually a different tone
4	love this feels very nice and did not irritate my somewhat sensitive \( eczema \) skin skin felt very soft , smooth , and clean after and it was n't terribly hard to wash off minus one star only because it is rather expensive but the tube is really large and should last a long time
3	the tin box this comes in a very attractive piece of packing too bad the products do n't live up to the promise they do what they say to varying degrees but they do n't do it better than any hundreds of other products , many of which come with a much lower price point if you want to give a nice looking gift to somebody this is an attractive package but you most likely would n't buy it for yourself
5	be sure to read directions also put some moisturizer near outer corners of eyes to prevent eyelashes growing where they do n't , otherwise this product works great fantastic for those who have gone through and lost all or part of lashes
5	you would n't think that an oil can clean your face , but this one really does i have somewhat dry , sensitive skin so never know exactly how i'm going to react to a skin product for that reason i really do look for the more organic brands i loved this cleanser it cleaned off my make up really well and left my skin soft it 's my new cleanser and recommended !
5	like the other l'occitane products i have tried , this cleansing oil is a winner ! you use it along with warm water , and it makes itself into a very effective , gentle and cleaning foam it feels just a little bit tingly going on , but you can also feel the nice hint of shea in it , which keeps it from making the skin dry at all my face feels totally clean and soft after using it i do n't use a lot of make up , but i put some on to take it off , some foundation , and it worked extremely well i might wear more foundation in the future , as i like to wear it , but other cleansers did n't always get it off completely , which i need , as i have rosacea if this has any scent , it 's extremely mild , so no worries there i love the elegant look of this product too ! it can be left out in the bathroom as it just looks nice highly recommended !
5	love this toner ! does n't sting or over dry the already dry areas on my face does n't cause excess oil on the oily parts keeps my skin soft
4	wake up to baby smooth skin it does the job no complaints here
5	i love this product ! ! ! it cleanses with no greasy residue after and it is very gentle it work wonders on dry skin !
4	the shade received was a coral \( \) it was the color shown in the picture rather neutral , not too dark it was lighter than expected , with a more matte finish does not leave marks when kissing these lipsticks are made in the eu , do not have much scent , and appears to be environmentally friendly and hypoallergenic they are a big step up from cheaper lipsticks however , a lot comes off on the napkin if you blot your lips is not a very lipstick , but it feels comfortable going on and coming off all in all , a quality product i am going to try giving them to friends as presents but i will choose a darker , brighter shade \( a brighter red \) to give away the neutral , lighter one just does not show up against the face as well
5	i'm not usually much of a lip gloss person because so many brands have a very sticky and tacky feel that i'm not a fan i thought i 'd give this one a try because my friend recommended it and i'm so glad i did ! the formula is super moisturizing and makes your lips feel wonderfully smooth , not sticky at all ! it 's got subtle color and shine and even smells delightful it 's like a cross between vanilla and cake i take it with me everywhere !
5	this is the first product by mario badescu i tried and it 's amazing ! makes my face feel great ! highly recommend it
4	this is a floral citrusy scent that lingers it 's not too strong nor too sweet a spray on the is all that 's needed for an all day aroma i like it it 's a scent that can appeal to women of all ages the bottle is far more glamorous than the scent the bottle is a heavy rose tinted bottle designed to look good on an
1	the brush is splayed out so i ca n't really use it just seems like cheap bristles or something \?
5	the moroccan oil weightless mask was a product recommended to me by my hairdresser i am an avid who cannot stand the feel of a swim cap , i color my hair and own a of hot hair tools , so suffice to say sometimes my hair needs a little tlc and after she used this on me at my last hair appointment i was hooked now this travel size is a great chance to try the product before committing to the full size and even then note that it is slightly pricey for the amount you get but for me the results are worth it so you be the judge to help you i used this 2 53 oz size \( and note i received a small tube not the tub as shown in the picture which is usually the full sized product \) and got about 4 or 5 uses out of it i tend to use a lot in one go and my hair is long , so you can probably be a bit more sparing and get a little more but not much more use out of it ! but ultimately this size would be great just to take on a trip or to see if this product is right for you , before spending upwards of 40 i also really liked the fact that you are able to get every last drop of the product out of the tube as nothing is more frustrating than spending money on a product then having residual amounts left behind due to poor packaging ! i use this about once a week usually post swim and leave on for about 5 minutes the smell is great and this scent lasts even when the mask has been washed out it is very conditioning and i am easily able to pull a comb right through after use my hair is very soft without being weighed down and does not have any feeling of residual product being left in which can often happen with hair masks or deep conditioners ! it really has made a difference to my hair this was enough to convince me to purchase the full size product it works , smells amazing and really conditions my hair ! great product !
5	i have used tinted moisturizers in the past , but this is by far my favorite it has enough of a tint to add some light coverage , but is sheer enough that i think the color i used would work on a large range of people i fall into the easily tans , wears a ton of sunscreen , italian olive skin tone category and it is a great match for me my girlfriend , who i would consider a makeup guru , tried this and proceeded to order it she agreed that it provided just enough coverage , a nice dose of sunscreen \( 20 spf \) and a healthy light reflecting glow as a moisturizer , it falls short for me i layer it over my moisturizer but i also have very dry skin i find myself using this almost daily instead of a full coverage foundation i like how light it feels and how easily it blends into my skin i use this , a little bronzer \( from the same line \) and mascara for a nice natural look definitely will be purchasing in the future , and highly recommend !
5	the buffering liquid was a bit hard to use , but i like the drying lotion and finish off with the drying cream zits dramatically reduced in 2 days
5	ok i tried the cinnamon one , it was a little too dark for my skin my mother is a little darker than i am and it was almost too light for her it kind of made her look ashy for both of us , with a little extra blending , the product could work it 's of great quality and let me tell you it does not take a lot which means this will last a long time it 's also hard to get off which is good and bad it does n't rub off on clothes but i had to scrub to get it off all in all , great product , not drying or caking
3	this is a nice cleanser , especially for makeup removal it leaves the skin feeling nice and clean but not stripped of all moisture , and it does n't make my oily skin break out unfortunately , i do n't like the synthetic floral scent of this cleanser and the scent is way too strong and unlike some other reviewers i did find it to linger sometimes if they used the same fragrance but cut the intensity of the scent down to about 25 of what it currently is i would probably give this 4 stars if it was fragrance free and slightly cheaper i would definitely give this 5 stars
5	i bought this as a gift for my best friend , she specifically asked for this ! she loves it , and she will continue buying this product because she is extremely pleased with it
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i only buy this on amazon great price !
5	prior to being offered this product , i was unfamiliar with the fragrance josie by josie natori since i can always use a good body cream , i decided to try it i absolutely love the fragrance of this body cream ! it is just the perfect combination of a floral scent and something a bit more exotic its a very sultry fragrance but not too heavy as a body cream , it left my skin not only smelling wonderful but also feeling wonderfully soft and smooth it is neither thick nor greasy , and it absorbs easily leaving behind only soft , beautifully smelling skin without any residue josie by josie natori body cream comes in a large , substantial feeling jar with an intriguing red floral cut out design over a black and white geometric pattern and makes for a fabulous looking accessory on my bathroom counter
5	love this product
5	this is a lovely summer color and it thrilled my granddaughter that is all i need to know ! it was delivered promptly and as described
5	you cannot go wrong with opi polishes
5	with just a hint of shimmer to jazz it up a bit love the color and love this brand it has really staying power , much longer than most brands of polish
5	i 've struggled with splotchy skin on my arms and back forever , and this really helps it 's not harsh , smells great , replaces my other body washes , and it leaves my skin really smooth feeling and looking love it i definitely notice the difference when i'm not using it if you are less than pleased with the smoothness of your skin , you should definitely give this a try
4	i am not giving this 5 stars for only one reason it was way too dark for my skin that is not the fault of la roche posay but is entirely the fault of me choosing the wrong color i just wanted to bring to others the fact that the dark beige is really dark i am a senior citizen with silver hair but i was so anxious to try this i did n't pay enough attention i recently fell and bruised my arm , very dark bruise , in fact i figured i would try it on that bruise since it was too dark for my face covered the bruise just fine , still darker than my skin but better than purple the concealer itself seemed a little pricey but i went ahead and ordered the light beige and hope it comes soon the pen is small but easy to work how much is actually inside the pen is anybody 's guess after i try the lighter color , i shall come back and revise this review i feel sure , though , that the other will work fine
5	great item
3	not as nude and natural looking as i thought it would be
4	wife 's review really loved the product as its anti aging effect was very quickly visible i have used it regularly for two weeks at certain specific areas around face and neck , and the smoothness in the skin is very visible it is smooth creamy texture and is a bit fluid like it very well and thus needs to be used in very small quantities however , the price is very very expensive and i am sure that there are cheaper alternatives to get such good quality
5	non irritating lash primer extender that really works !
5	i have frizzy hair and use good hair products , but never thought much about my blow dryer i read the reviews and decided to give this a try love it it made a huge difference with the way my hair turned out i do agree that the buttons get pushed while you are trying to use it , but for the great results , i will get over it so worth it
5	i love it
5	i love essie polishes essie products are very consistent in the quality it goes on smoothly and dries very fast
1	these just really did n't work for me i have diffuse thinning not the worst out there , but quite noticeable sprinkling the fibers just caused them to kind of bunch up and clump , so it was really obvious there was something going on on my scalp if you sweat a little bit or scratch your head , the fibers will really turn into clumps i'm glad this works for other people , but i do n't really want anyone to be able to tell that i'm hiding my thin hair behind some powder
5	this moisturizer works really well for my super sensitive skin i'm allergic to fragrance and two preservatives and this formula contains none of these irritants it feels really soothing on the skin and sinks in quickly it does n't leave a greasy residue and would be suitable for someone with combination skin like mine after several hours , i get a little oily in the t zone but this lotion does n't make the oiliness more pronounced all in all , i'm satisfied with my purchase i only wish it came in a bigger tube however , it is concentrated so just a few dots around my face and on my neck is enough coverage i definitely recommend this product
4	i 've tried the evian and vichy type of this setting spray this by far them i do n't wear much makeup in the summer here in georgia thanks to the heat , humidity and the fact i do n't have to work since i'm a teacher i do apply powder when i go to church this helped set the powder but it made my mascara run a bit i use waterproof great lash
5	a product with fresh expiration date satisfied
5	best blush out there and one small compact lasts forever
5	love it ! curls stay and last ! i bought this on the recommendation of an right price and it works beautifully ! !
5	my 16 yr old niece got this for christmas she tried it out the next day and loved it she has n't made any complaints yet so i assume the product is good as far as packing , it was done well and arrived ahead of schedule \( which is always a plus \)
5	i 've been using this stuff religiously and it has made a tremendous difference in my skin i get compliments all the time
4	i'm a big fan of vincent longo products and this one is definitely a favorite i love the fact that it is buildable so you can choose how much highlight to apply i definitely recommend using a fan brush because it gives the best finish i'm only giving it 4 stars because i think it 's a little too pricey
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	hair products are my absolute favorite , and i have tried a lot this leave in conditioner smells nice , does n't weigh your hair down , and comes in a huge bottle that lasts forever hydrating to my dry ends but does n't make the rest of my hair greasy
3	first off i love the color of this polish in the bottle however , as is noted it is translucent so i bought the essie blanc which is recommended as a first coat it still took about five coats for the polish to look ok not fantastic just ok i am not expecting this manicure to last long as it required so many coats to look acceptable i will have to try it without the white undercoat maybe it will look ok but i doubt it i would not buy this color again
5	excellent loved
4	i have tried lots of face moisturizers such as cetaphil , loreal , oil of olay , cindy crawford this is my favorite it feels wonderful on my skin i like the smell of it it goes on easy and absorbs fast its not greasy i believe it has helped to smooth out my face tone i have 50 year old somewhat dry skin in new england and it is perfect for me the only issue is that is it expensive and its not just a small dab needed
5	good stuff ! when i first got into de shaving i tried all kinds of shave creams , soap etc after the dust settled and my wallet was empty i found the proraso shave soaps i find with a good badger brush and possibly a drop of shave oil this soap is all one needs for the perfect close shave ! i like the green proraso sometimes a bit better than this white and sometimes i prefer this white so i keep both on hand and alternate i find the value of this product is simply incredible with a badger brush i get fantastic , perfect lather and this product last many months before i need to order more i find using one drop of shave secret oil in my mix is preferred but not required to get that perfect shave ! i like the built in cup as i shave in the shower and with this plastic \( \) cup i can whip up a good later in no time
5	boyfriend loved it i love it he smells great ca n't keep my hands off him
5	if you are struggling with acne you have to buy this line i never run out ! i went to school for and i recommend to all my friends
3	this is an okay concealer for minimal imperfections the consistency is smooth , so it applies easily the color tone was a bit different than i had expected viewing it from the tube , it appeared to be the right shade , but that was n't the case i have a medium light to beige skin tone , and found that this medium was a little on the yellow side for my skin tone i was able to remedy the yellowish tone by doing a bit of extra blending and setting with an additional powder and brush i found this to be okay for minimal imperfections or for light details that you 'd want to cover up if it 's a small freckle or beauty mark , then it does wonders , but for a scar or blemish mark , it does n't really offer adequate long lasting coverage like some of my other concealers in order to have consistent coverage , i would have to keep reapplying this throughout the day
5	i have long hair \( almost waist length \) that is foil wrapped \( highlighted \) every 6 weeks and my hair texture is baby fine but lots of it so blow drying without frying it can be a challenge i 've used other tamer type products in the past but they seem geared only towards those with naturally curly , coarse type hair or something and weigh my baby locks down this product gives me shine without weight and the very best thing , especially in winter , is that i'm not left with tons of static cling in my hair after blow drying it also seems to protect my hair from the heat of the blow dryer this has worked for me even in the most humid weather another good thing is this product is so light that after using , i can curl my normally straight hair and it will curl and the curls last just as if i did n't use the product and i cannot say that about any other tamer type product i 've ever used the only downside to this product is that it is somewhat expensive but i 've found that even though i do have lots of hair , a little less than a dime sized amount is plenty to get the results i want so the bottle does last a long time for me just pour a small amount in your hand , rub your palms together and apply to your hair i do my ends first and work my way up to the crown , then blow dry as normal
5	my new favorite cnd shellac polish color excellent coverage with beautiful color in sunlight dark brown with a hint of dark purple and black gorgeous !
3	the clipper , nail file , and tweezers are a nice stainless steel the slanted tweezers work well they grasp the hair and pull it from the root instead of just breaking it the nail file is wonderful one side is coarse and the other side is fine both sides work extremely well to shape and seal nails the nail clipper , on the other hand , is a bit flimsy and hard to open it 's also made of stainless steel , but it 's so thin that its difficult to cut your nails unfortunately , the design is great but it falls short on functionality i find that it slips out of place i have long nails and i bent one of them when the nail clipper slipped out of position i wo n't be using it again i 'll stick with my trim nail clipper i would n't recommend this manicure set , unless you have very thin and fragile nails , especially at the current price of 99
5	i love this product !
5	lovely color and a little shimmery was a pleasant \)
5	i only use mustela on my small children when they are so small , any chemical or questionable ingredient had a huge impact on their overall that 's why i trust mustela with their proven track record of quality and safe ingredients this is a great set for any new mom they products are safe , convenient and effective
4	if i could change anything about mario badescu drying lotion product , it would be the quantity
4	after using crest strips for a while , i decided to try this system it works fine , but went back to the white strips
3	i have very sensitive skin meaningful beauty did burn when i put it on , not horribly but my face definitely felt hot it continued for about thirty minutes i was careful not to get it near my eyes does this work , well my skin felt smoother i did not notice any difference in fine lines but my face was soft and felt hydrated i used this only at night as it caused my face to also become red for about an hour when i applied it under my make up the capsules are easy to open and you only need one this goes on well and you do not need more than the amount in the little capsule this is convenient and helps you with the proper amount of product i will continue to use this at night but will not do so in the morning due to the burning sensation and red skin
5	i am a hot tools fanatic this big barrel is great for loose waves
1	i got this to my liquid makeup , but this just does n't work it cakes up quickly and it does n't set my face at all
5	my stylist recommended this great price you can adjust the heat for your hair type holds curls great just spray a little hair spray and your sure to look and feel your best !
5	use it for myself really like it as daily moisturizer
4	ok , so assuming money is no object , this is a decent product exfoliator works well \( not really for the face , more for the neck , chest , arms and body \) i do love the moisturizer \( body repair \) it 's thick and creamy \( almost reminds me of my mother 's old ponds face cream \) i will say that my skin feels great after a couple of weeks of use did n't really have a crepe problem , but i do have dry skin and some fine wrinkles this duo does the job however , the 4 star rating is for the cost this is really a size , yet it is over 60 in cost you can do better on your own using other products \( i love ahava products as well as olay \) i say shop around a bit or wait for the price to come down a bit
5	it works very well , does n't smell bad , and is n't too greasy i hate when the cream feels like it lays there , like an oil this blends right in and does a fantastic job
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	good !
5	this burberry men 's cologne comes in a 50 ml \( 1 7 oz \) sleek and simple bottle that fits comfortably in the hand the first blast of spray is sharp and bracing reminiscent of a first of a or any kind of blast that makes one stop and think , whoa this will definitely wake you up the scent then becomes subtle , soft and clean almost like background you know its there but it does n't call attention to itself i think professional men would be comfortable with this slightly \( to me \) clean and woodsy scent
5	excellent quality love this line perfect for my mid forties mild rosacea gentle and lovely recommend going to a store that carries jane iredale product to find your color match you can find those on the website then you can order whatever you like with confidence
5	we love the smell of this stuff ! keeps our babies skin soft and never has irritated it !
2	this is an okay eyeliner it goes on smooth enough and lasts as long as others i 've used but , it 's actually slightly more irritating to my eyes than other eyeliners , so i wo n't be using it again i do n't see anything to justify paying 17 for it , either , but that 's the la roche posay brand it 's expensive i also agree that it 's hard to get out of the wrapper , but i think the amazon vine label over the pencil 's wrapper was the problem it kept the pull strip from pulling all the way down
4	this is a just right cream moisturizing but not too heavy fast to absorb with a mild pleasant scent and if it is good for sensitive skin it should be good for all
5	i have really dry hair and have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market paul mitchell makes great products and i have had some success with his products before this is worth the money ! this smells great and really works to smooth and moisturize dry hair i'm really shocked in a great way !
5	i want to bathe in this every day i have super dry skin and this cream is super luxurious and moisturizing the smell is amazing and not overpowering it is clean and a tiny bit floral with a bit of almond it contains two of my favorite ingredients sweet almond oil and indian rose those are just amazing for your skin and the sweet almond oil does an amazing thing when you need extra moisture if you want one splurge , this is the perfect thing i have dry sensitive skin and this really helps to relieve that and it is really helpful on your neck and decolletage areas
5	love this gray ! asphalt is nice and dark , but tends to be very thick cityscape is smooth goes wonderful with metallic additives
3	this polish is watery way more so then the other colors maybe its a fake i do n't know i should have bought in store
4	really meant to order same brand but at 50 spf i can use the lower spf during southern california winter recommended by my dermatologist and was told not to go below 30 spf so i am safe also seems to leave less of the yellow color on my clothing
5	i 'd been wanting to try this londontown polish since reading about it in allure magazine , and i really do love it ! i'm a nail polish junkie , and have been increasingly seeking out brands like butter london that steer away from those nasty chemicals that are in traditional polish i'm also pretty hard on my nails and seem to get chips right away , but this actually lasted two full days on me \( which is pretty impressive for me ! \) before the tips started chipping with just one coat of this color , you still get nice , dense coverage , and two coats gives you even more if you look at the photos i uploaded , the one on the right is with one coat , and the one on the left is with two you can tell that one coat still gives pretty opaque coverage the trolley away color is also really fun it 's a cross between lilac and lavender , and adds a fun and yet neutral pop of color to an outfit i 'll definitely be buying more shades from londontown
2	not as pretty as i had hoped
5	i use to use this for years and years and it was only thing would work on my occasional breakouts now i do n't use it as i do n't breakouts but my 2 teenage sons use it and it works on them as well
5	i have used prescription retinoids since i was in my late twenties they are great except even the most experienced users can over apply and end up with irritated skin i tried this bliss product all this weekend wow ! not only was it soothing and hydrating , but it made my skin radiant \( probably as a result of the retinoid bliss combo \) i like the light but unisex scent , the generous amount in the jar \( i do n't feel the tiniest bit guilty reapplying this throughout the day \) , and the non greasy look \( and , do n't hesitate to use it on your neck and on the back of your hands two very neglected areas \) i think this is a fantastic product for those who use potentially drying products like ahas or retinoids this will deliver a fantastic infusion of moisture ! !
5	this cover stick has excellent ease of application , and i am very happy with the thorough coverage it have on particular areas it is a bit pricey , but there is wonderful coverage here , and if that 's what you are looking for you will absolutely not go wrong i applied it in the middle of the day getting ready to go out to two different occasions so , it lasted from noon the wee hours of the morning when i checked in the mirror as i was getting ready to retire for the evening , i was very happy to see that what was covered so many hours ago was still invisible under very bright bathroom lighting therefore , if it 's results you are looking for , you will probably consider this an excellent purchase ! the are i will return to get this same item again when it is used up
4	i have been using the nuface trinity facial trainer kit with the wrinkle reducer attachment for a few weeks now best results take up to 60 days but i will give my best early impression now since i need to leave a review within 30 days in exchange for testing out the product this kit includes the facial toning device , wrinkle reducer attachment and a tube of primer gel there are a couple of instruction and the charger cable and cradle i am impressed with the quality of the device itself it is very well made and the curved design fits well both in your hand and on the contours of your face bonus points from me for being dual voltage for use overseas and for the charger having retractable for travel or storage i have pretty average combination skin and have had no adverse reaction to using this on a regular basis i was especially concerned about the red light wrinkle attachment but it actually feels very pleasant during treatment just a nice , warm feeling when pressed against your skin it is not necessary to use the primer gel with the wrinkle attachment , which makes it easy for me to stick to a routine of using just before bed i keep the device next to my bed and use it while catching up on or listening to there is a built in timer so you do n't have to watch the clock when using the device with either attachment it 's too early to see what long term improvements there may be but i do like using this device it makes me feel as if i am pampering my face and i like being able to do this in the of my own home at my own convenience to get the best results , you need to make a serious commitment to using this as directed several times as week but once i got comfortable with how the device works , it really has been easy to keep up with my routine i am a cynic when it comes to something like this but my skin certainly feels better than it did before but the real test will be whether or not i see any significant improvement in the next 30 days while this is a quality device that feels luxurious to use , unless it delivers the results it promises , it will not be worth the cost so stay tuned since i will definitely be back to update on my progress
4	thought it would be a little darker , but overall still a good color !
5	i love obagi products , but they can be a bit pricey on most these days
5	this is gorgeous i normally top my liquid foundation with a loose mineral one for extra coverage and because i think powder foundations give the most natural skin like finish typically , pressed powder foundations do n't work as well for me as loose ones , but this one is lovely i have oily skin , so i always use a setting powder i opted to go without the first time i tried this foundation , and while i did get a little shiny by the end of the day , it was not bad at all and when i wear this with a light dusting of powder over top , i stay matte until i take it off
4	i 've be been using this serum in conjunction with is clinical active serum , and i love the combo it is expensive , but worth it i can see the fine lines disappear , but also the over quality \( youthfulness \) of my skins feels and looks a lot better i still use a moisturizer , in this order 1 wash face and pat dry 2 put on is clinical active serum 1 oz , wait a couple minutes to let it absorb 3 put on this c serum , wait a couple minutes to let it absorb 4 use face cream with light coverage 5 use face makeup \( i use a light , natural foundation and powder \) the only reason i marked down by 1 star is the smell of this product it does n't smell like orange , it more like vitamin smell which is n't really very pleasant other than that , i love it !
5	i love this stuff ! no matter how tired i am this stuff makes my face look refreshed and glowing and that 's with no make up ! oh , and i will be turning 59 in a couple of months i will be buying this again
5	so i 've tried probably hundreds of balms over the years and i truly think jack black balms are one of the best on the market they are thin , but so , so emollient and last a long time on the lips i 've got very dry lips and generally need to apply balm many times throughout the day but with these i can go several hours between applications i appreciate the more subdued scents i love smelling berries and candy on my lips sometimes , but other times it 's nice to have a more grown up scent for the price , you ca n't go wrong , this is a wonderful product that could be priced much higher and still be worth it
5	this is one of the best liners i have tried
5	i usually use mineral fusion pressed powder foundation but i had heard some good things about this product i got a deal on it so decided to give it a try ! i'm glad i did ! the tan powder is a perfect color match now that i 've gotten a little bit of sun does a fantastic job of keeping my skin matte , and with the help of a good primer and setting spray , it looks as good at as it did when i applied it at while mineral fusion has a much wider color range , and i 'll continue to use because of that , i'm going to use p r minerals as well !
4	years ago , i used strivectin i think i stopped because it was getting difficult to find and was expensive this product , i like when you first use it , you have to pull the white lid off and then twist the top to the on position so that the product can come out it was extra easy to use on my neck and chest area and those areas feel very smooth and soft after application , put the roller in the off position this firms up the skin quickly i am game to use this on a regular basis
5	love it use it daily
3	honestly , i did n't see any difference when using this makeup it was easy enough to apply and felt smooth going on , but it did n't make my face noticeably more matte or dewy my face is neither super oily or dry , so maybe that is why
4	i know this is a detail , but i so much prefer powders and bronzers in a round cake form like this bliss go for the bronze powder i also like not receiving another small useless brush which is often found in compacts having a wonderful set of cosmetic brushes on hand assures that i can apply cosmetics with tools that are not simply add enclosed to market a product the texture of this bronzer is very sweet with a little to enhance the skin texture when light hits the face as with other bliss cosmetics , i 've experienced no skin sensitivity and find no offensive scent of course , if a light touch is used when applying the bronzer , the color will not be as concentrated or rich as when an additional layer is applied i'm finding that bliss cosmetics tend to have the underlying yellow hue which i have seen in other higher end cosmetics the square plastic case is well designed to protect the product yet it is lightweight due to its plastic construction and shiny mirror like finish this also has an interior mirror which is handy for an application on the go
3	vichy pore purifying clay mask is a light clay mask for combination and oily skin that features bentonite and kaolin clays it claims to skin , soothe skin , eliminate dirt and , mattify skin , leave skin feeling soft and clean , and reduce pore size with regular use vichy also claims that it is safe for sensitive skin aloe vera and allantoin are the soothing ingredients i have very sensitive skin with effectively no barrier ive had bad reactions to clay masks in the past and have found them too drying , but i gave this one a try , because the ingredients seemed mild , and the instructions said to leave the mask on for only 3 5 minutes it should not dry on your skin the clay is fine textured and gray it goes on in a thin layer , so a 2 54 oz \( 75 ml \) jar will last a long time vichy recommends to use it 1 2 times per week , concentrating on the t zone area or wherever your pores tend to clog rinse off with water i started with a small area to make sure i was n't going to react to the mask i ended up using it on my whole face i left the mask on for about 6 minutes , and it was dry in spots it dries quite quickly i can confirm vichys claim that this mask works with sensitive skin i did n't have any problems with it i was a little concerned that my skin would react to the fragrance , which i have seen described as a light scent of mint and woody amber i do n't smell the mint , but i would describe the scent as an amber with woody notes its musky , and i think there are some florals in there it does not seem light when the mask is smeared on my face , in close proximity to my nose i found the scent unpleasant after a while its too strong for a mask , and the musky floral is an odd choice i was most interested in the masks pore clarifying properties it removed about half of blackheads and performed less well on smaller oil deposits that were not oxidized i the results in a 10x magnifying mirror , which is scary but essential to see how skin care products are working and to distinguish between a blackhead and a freckle my nourishing cleansing oil does a better job on the oil deposits a fine grained scrub removes both blackheads and other oil deposits the vichy pore purifying clay mask did leave my skin feeling smoother than it began , but not as smooth or soft as im accustomed to when i do a facial treatment ive used other mud masks that worked better on blackheads and oil but proved too harsh for my skin so there is a trade off if you have sensitive skin and like masks , this one is probably safe there are more effective alternatives , however ingredients aqua water , kaolin , , propanediol , glycerin , caprylic capric triglyceride , ci 77891 , cetearyl alcohol , zea mays starch , ci 77499 , ci 77492 , ci 77491 , allantoin , ceteareth 20 , aloe barbadensis leaf juice powder , lecithin , phenoxyethanol , tocopherol , caprylyl glycol , xanthan gum , parfum
5	this color is so pretty ! ! ! i saw it on pinterest and had to get it ! i is pretty light so i have to put on about 3 coats to get my ideal color , but i usually put on 2 coats of any color anyway just to get good coverage
5	nice light toner to get the last bits of dirt off your face and tone your skin before you put moisturizer and make up on i love the la roche posay line
5	the silver vip is a a clear uv cured polish , with silver glitter flecks cnd created for great layering add on i like having some non shimmery colors that i can chose to make shimmer by adding either silver vip or gold vip silver vip on top of asphalt makes a great metallic and on top of black makes it not so the gold vip looks awesome over rubble ca n't wait to try more effects it will take a while , because a mani cnd shellac lasts sooooo long
5	love this rich color , that 's good to go in one or two coats ! it is a cool toned magenta , but it is hard to see in the picture that there is also a very fine silver glitter very subtle but very beautiful ! i find i can really pull this color off any time of year
3	when i was offered this product through vine , i had never tried a nuxe product before relaxing fragrant water sounded pretty great so , when it arrived , i was anxious to see what it was like it 's nice it came in a pretty , opaque white heavy glass atomizer bottle as is pictured it sprays a light mist of scented fragrance that is actually relaxing it has a sort of musky scent yet is different it 's not sweet or floral i wish i knew better how to describe it but it is pleasant it did n't last a long time for me , maybe a few hours i think that that is pretty standard for this type of water based fragrance the ingredients list that it is mostly alcohol and fragrance it seems a bit expensive for that but , if you like it , i guess it 's worth it i like it but probably not enough to pay the current price of 25 i 'll keep using it and see how i feel over time it is pleasant and relaxing is it addictive \? \? \? \? we 'll see three and a half stars 5 10 17 after having this and using it for awhile , i 've remained loyal to my former preferred fragrances this is nice for an occasional change but i will not be repurchasing it it 's pretty expensive , for what it is , and i'm just not that big of a fan lovely bottle though !
4	true to it 's word this is indeed a 3 step facial conveniently packaged in a little box what you 're getting is a 34 ounce pump bottle of the foaming mask solution , 2x individually sealed glycolic resurfacing pads and 2x packets of vitamin c day cream while the kit is intended to provide 2 complete facials i'm able to squeeze 4 complete treatments out of it as the glycolic pads can be cut in half and still cover the entirety of my face neck and each pack of the c cream can be used for 2 separate applications with the foaming mask a little goes a very long way and i estimate that i could very likely get 8 10 applications out of it like with all bliss products formulation is very high quality , pleasantly scented and i 've experienced no irritation while all the of rejuvenated and glowing skin a very convenient kit perfectly suited for travel or as a sampler set to experiment with quality bliss products
5	love this color , finally a deep dark red ! applies like traditional nail polish and does n't ruin my nails have been using cnd shellac for over two years and do n't use anything else !
5	i have been using this as part of my morning routine and it fits right in the serum is light weight and perfect for wearing under my foundation or alone on days when my skin is feeling especially dry , it also layers nicely with heavier moisturizing creams without making me feel like i'm wearing a thick mask of products nobody wants to feel like their products are caked on the scent , which is something i always have to consider as some can cause me to break out or be too intense for me , is not an issue for me at all it is light enough not to overwhelm and i did n't experience any skin reaction at all with all that said , i get the same benefits and results from the olay products i use i am saying this after using this serum for a few weeks now and seeing no difference in my skin i 'll probably continue using my far less and just as effective olay products and would recommend others consider doing the same unless you simply must spend so much money on a skin serum , olay is excellent
5	got this for my hubby maybe now he will stay out of mine i like the smell does n't smell perfumey highly recommended between haircuts my husband 's hair gets a little too long and i'm sure this is when he 'll use it , to give him some style
5	this is refreshing ! it is a liquid water like cleanser with a pleasant scent with a hint of rose i used a cotton pad to clean my face and it felt clean and soft after using this cleanser and it is so refreshing it wakes you up a bit you just put a little on a cotton ball and it cleans your make up or facial oils i look forward to using it more and back on the effect on my skin so far , am pleased with the product
5	this color is incredible ! great formula that applies beautifully and does n't chip easily ! fast shipping
5	opens with a big vanilla and juicy apricot , then the flowers arrive jasmine , ylang ylang peach blossoms the jasmine is a little sharp at first but calms down to a distinct , lovely flower it 's a full , juicy apricot but the sharpness of the flowers keep it from getting too sweet i would actually like a bit more apricot because this is a really good one not the fake , rotting fruit type underneath all of this is an exotic mix of sandalwood , wood and spice , this is a huge oriental vanilla flower bomb delicious if you like these notes not a standard vanilla it 's not sweet , no patchouli no musky notes very adult fragrance and very well made it 's like standing in a tropical garden with a glass of the most delicious , aged rum in your hand even though it 's supposed to be a female fragrance , i really think a man could wear this one the flowers are there but it 's not girly and the vanilla with spicy sandalwood say , me , i know what i'm doing ! i think men would have women wanting to sniff get closer \) as with most parfum , the sillage is huge it can fill a room so go easy one spray is plenty this lasts and lasts on my skin i still get the vanilla flower scent the next day
3	it looks watered down
5	this two ounce plastic bottle of mario badescu moisturizer has spf15 sunscreen it is a perfect size for your any time i go outside i squeeze a nickel size drop in my palm and coat my face and arms lately i have been terrified about the effects of the sun i saw an article and pictures in the new england journal of medicine , you can google to see the pictures the side of the man 's face that was exposed to the sun during his truck driving looks about 20 years older than the other side of his face that was well shaded in his okay got it sunblock , sunblock , sunblock ! ! ! ! and i love the mario badescu brand , nothing clears up acne better , so in the moisture magnet , i trust that and a hat the moisturizer is creamy , , and works into the skin in seconds very , very light scent , i ca n't really smell it , and i get bothered by scent , so do n't worry about this one light pink in color , goes on totally clear no visible signs of sunblock , no shine , no grease and it makes your skin so unbelievable soft like the whole texture of your skin is improved i really like this product
4	no instructions in english on the tube , so i crossed my fingers that it would n't burn my eyes it says it takes off eye makeup , so i hoped for the best it went on light , not too creamy , and washed off easily and left my face feeling clean and somewhat soft
5	love ! ! ! ! pink with microglitter bought 2 bottles !
5	i loooove essie polishes they wear great , do n't chip , and have dozens and dozens of colors you ca n't find anywhere else this color is vibrant and has the tiniest and i mean tiny amount of sparkle to it it is a great go to color for when you ca n't decide at the salon for all ages ! \) i highly recommend this one , ladies \)
5	great
5	comes nicely packaged ready to be given as a gift without further wrapping everything about it says money , so if the intended purpose is a gift , it will be obvious you spent some i think it 's next to impossible to describe a cologne , but i will say this is very clean with some citrus notes masculine , but not heavy quite a nice scent
4	i trust this brand and while i have n't had the product long enough to give any feedback on long term results , i will definitely be updating my review as time goes on usually with a good eye cream you can feel it working right away , as is the case with this product ten minutes after putting it on i still felt the tightening feeling under and around my eyes while there have been no drastic changes as of yet puffiness was definitely reduced and the reduction of the bags under my eyes from a lack of sleep the other night was definitely noticeable while you can feel it working on your skin there is no residue feeling , which is a huge plus since i do n't like heavy creams on my skin i will update my review later with long term results but so far so good until i see the long term results i ca n't say if it 's worth the money or not , but if first impressions are any indication it very well may be
4	nice color
5	i love this product
4	i'm excited to find a dermablend cosmetic that i can wear without causing skin irritation this toast colored powder covers well it left my complexion with a hint of the appearance of a tan this is a medium coverage build able base powder i apply with a powder brush i then set it with mineral water also , the compact comes with a thin sponge for a more intense application overall i like this product it provides good coverage
5	i have medium yellowish olive skin tone which has been difficult to find a neutral this shade tea and crumpets is beautiful ! i was looking for a color that would match as closely as possible to my natural nail bed color , and i was not having any luck ! finally i went less pink , more neutral tan , and this is so flattering ! contrary to what i thought , it 's lighter than my skin tone , and it actually brightens my fingers i mistakenly thought lighter colors would darken my skin , but this is a splendid exception \( nice word splendid \) it 's definitely a frost , and i find it streaks a little , but i'm not a professional , so that 's fine for me i'm just thrilled to death i finally found a color that is n't goth or weird or screaming for attention i like subtle and refined , and this is it ! it 's so pretty !
5	i am a 28 yo male and i use many jack black products because of their commitment to nature , science , and more importantly men 's skin i use the protein booster skin serum , energizing scrub , double duty lotion , and now this night cream it provides instant hydration without leaving behind an oily residue i used to use zirh rejuvenate as my night cream and that worked well but it is harder and harder to find zirh in stores or online anymore the jack black dry erase ultra calming cream is just what it says it is it provides moisture and calms the skin after even the harsher and cheaper face washes combine this with the protein serum and double duty moisturizer for day use and you have a comprehensive day night regime that provides your skin with the ant drying and ant aging moisture it needs
5	i previously used a drug store spray on heat protectant for flat ironing , i did n't love the product because it was tedious to spray each section as you ironed it was difficult to not spray completed sections and if you accidentally did , that section may look greasy chi silk infusion does a great job of protecting your hair from heat damage if you use the correct amount , it will add shine , not be greasy and help to dry your hair faster than if you left your hair in its natural state chi silk infusion does not have a strong odor , but a light fragrance that disappears as your hair dries all in all , it 's a great product that will become a staple for me
3	i recently purchased this , obviously , in hopes of getting more voluminous hair i have only used it a few times and i do feel that it does what the product description says my problem with this stuff is that a sediment has formed in the bottom of the bottle and it prevents the sprayer from working properly i am able to spray once and then i have to wait several seconds before i can spray again if i can spray at all it has been completely clogged i tried heating the bottom of the bottle with my hair dryer and letting it sit in a bowl of warm water in hopes of up the sediment the hair dryer had no effect and the warm water did work some but not nearly enough i think i will be the manufacturer and will try to update this review afterwards update i emailed matrix and they are willing to me for the purchase of this product
4	love this production , but sometimes it comes out a bit , even with the fiberhold spray definitely would recommend it for anyone with thin thinning hair
5	it 's a beautiful , dark color !
4	i have very sensitive underarms and always use a gentle roll on i have n't used a cream deodorant since the 70s we used a cream in a jar , which we applied with our fingers this tube of vichy is much easier to apply since you just squirt a little to the top of the applicator end and spread it under the arms once applied , it does n't feel sticky and it does n't burn i smell very clean all day ! i do n't sweat much at my age , but odor can be a concern at any age this product really works i would love it more if it were scented , but it 's still nice
5	the combination of scents in this perfume are contemporary , delightful , and of varied aromatherapy first rate
5	love it ! curls stay and last ! i bought this on the recommendation of an right price and it works beautifully ! !
5	i am not the type of guy that would rave about a moisturizer , but this stuff is seriously the s works better than expensive , absorbs immediately and you do n't smell or feel greasy highly recommend
5	one of the best moisturizers for my fragile skin and i really appreciate the spf ! for daily use , it 's perfect ! the price on amazon is the best price found
5	love the scent and the moisturizing oils added for nail health
5	i'm pretty happy about the lumarx facial cleansing brush it is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use the tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use the instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening it has which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the t zone the tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area this is a great feature ! it also comes with 3 brush heads massage , sensitive and normal skin i am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation when i am finished with that minute , my skin just glows and feels so clean ! hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as i do not think they are yet available on amazon or online it also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter this is important to me as i have a small bathroom also , the lumarx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation
5	i'm a long time user of dermablend but this is a new product for me i usually stick to liquid concealers i decided to try this one really because of the name quick fix it 's definitely quicker , very easy application , and the coverage is as good as their liquid concealer i was worried about the fact that the color choices are fewer than with liquid , but i'm happy with the color i got medium , because even though i am fair complected \( red hair , freckles \) , the light colors tend to make me look like reverse eyes because i have so much pink in my skin that it 's actually darker than it appears this was a good call , so unless you are translucent i would seriously consider using medium instead of light for the same reasons
5	exactly as described sure wish i could find opi 's start to finish ca n't find it anywhere
4	real good but art of shaving cream is better proraso is cheaper and is good
2	the polish i received looks nothing like the one shown for sale it looks more similar to essie 's play date this was also the first time i 've purchased nail polish online lesson learned stick to purchasing polish in person
5	gets very hot , works great good buy would recommend !
5	great moisturizer and sunscreen feel pleasant on skin , not greasy , will buy it again ! ! !
5	i love nail polish \( what girl does n't \) and this pretty , girly color stays on fabulously i 'll definitely be ordering more in other colors
5	this palette is small but has nice color assortment the colors are very pigmented , and the shadows are easy to blend and soft and buttery the shimmer is n't too glittery , just a perfect glow
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
2	darker than i expected , goes on smoothly i used it to cover heart surgery scar but it almost seems to call more attention to it pleasant scent
5	love this neon summer collection , and the name says a lot peachy and light , perfect !
5	i was sent a sample of this cleansing lotion from nordstrom and liked it so much that i purchased more it is great for combination skin i have oily skin around my nose and upper cheeks as well as my forehead the rest of my face is dry this is called the i have used this cleanser and it 's gentle , does not clog my pores , and has a nice clean smell it does not suds up so i need to be careful not to use too much i like it a lot
4	i like this serum , a few drops and it smooths evenly over my whole face i have n't noticed a cooling sensation when applying , but it does absorb quickly and leaves my skin soft i have skin that is prone to breaking out , so i pick products carefully that are for sensitive skin this serum did n't cause any break outs while using it , and may have kept the pimples at bay i did n't notice a fragrance in the serum , it smelled faintly of medicine it is a light blue color , but it was n't noticeable after blending in my skin all in all i like how this serum makes my skin feel soft
4	i 've had a hard time finding a true body soap for men that gives a true moisturized finish a lot of men 's products in this category are obnoxiously perfumed \( axe comes to mind \) or the moisturizing effects , while seemingly effective in the shower , seem to disappear once the body is towel dried and dressed this jack black product met all of my expectations and then some by providing a smooth , buttery sheen that really lingers for hours while delivering on all that you 'd expect from a premium priced bath soap this particular concoction a variety of premium oils \( argan , jojoba , olive fruit , ginger root and shea butter \) to provide a really nice finish that leaves you with a nice , healthy glow and good moisturized finish the scent profile is also very pleasing with , and ginger that gives a crisp and refreshing fragrance that subtly lingers afterward and never overpowers a couple of pumps on a proper wash cloth \( for best results i use one of the nylon , scrubby japanese bath towels that is great for exfoliation and the best lather possible nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href salux nylon japanese beauty skin bath wash cloth towel green dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 salux nylon japanese beauty skin bath wash cloth towel green a \) is really all you need to get the job which means you 'll be able to get many months of use out of the standard 12 oz dispenser
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
1	do n't like both the texture \( too thin \) and color \( too orange \) , i'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews elta md lightly tinted for extra sensitive skin is far superior sunscreen
5	love , love this product ! works great put it on at night in the morning !
4	this is a very good pencil liner it is retractable , no need to sharpen i do find the tip gets a bit rounded , so like most other pencil liners , you really are n't going to get the most precise thin line but i tend to smudge my liner anyway the shade of black is nice and dark , although not quite as dark as urban decay if you are familiar with that shade it is closer in color to urban decay zero \( which i prefer , but not everyone does \) i find that this stays on really well i do n't really use it on my waterline , just smudged on my lid , but it stays well and smokes out well with a brush the pencil has a smudger sponge , but i do n't find the smudger all that useful it kind of on the lid , so i prefer to use a brush to smoke it out overall , this is a good liner i have it in 2 other shades as well \( chocolate and bronze \) i like it just as much as my urban decay 24 7 liners but appreciate that i do n't have to sharpen them
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
3	the formula for this body repair treatment is interesting it 's not a drippy lotion in fact , it is almost a solid , like a tub of crisco it goes on very greasy , and stays greasy for quite a while it is very hard to rub in i do n't see any incredible changes in my skin just yet , but will add that this has a very strong fragrance i'm not sure why a company thinks this is a good idea besides causing a reaction on sensitive skin , it would clash with any perfume one might choose to wear overall so far , this is just ok it might have gotten a higher rating if it was unscented and i honestly do n't know if i 'll continue to use this because of the smell it does n't seem worth the price edit i decided to bite the bullet and use this daily at bedtime i'm actually used to the fragrance now it does leave my skin very soft and moisturized when i wake up , but i do n't know if that has anything to do with this product being special , or just because it 's so thick
5	love it
4	this is my first product of this type and i love it ! both the massage and cleaning functions are awesome because it does not absorb your cleanser you only need a drop or 2 to do the job my family has noticed a definite improvement in my skin i love the model as i am 57 and need to be gentle to my skin my fine lines are less noticeable and even the crease between my brows has lessened i marked it down 1 star because it randomly skips a beat or stops and also i sometimes have to turn it back on and then off again to get the light in the base to go out to preserve charge hopefully it lasts well because i love what it does to my skin !
4	i'm impressed by how effective this face cream is after only a few applications i avoid the sun for health reasons but i am still pretty sun kissed in the face , chest and arms because we live in florida after using this cream morning and night for two days , i was able to see a noticeable difference in the darkness of the pigment in all three areas i am pretty fair \( \) , so being able to even out my complexion without any burning , itching or irritation is a bonus
5	the color is nice and stays on a long time unlike other polishes i have tried would definitely buy this again
5	the la roche foaming gel from the tube as a clear liquid i have rubbed it on my skin once a day before showering i find that it does clean my skin with no adverse effects i intend to continue to use it
4	this product , a brand and part of l'or eacute al , is a moisturizing cream that purports to provide nearly two days of hydration for your skin as we get older it is important to keep our skin healthy for a number of reasons we 're not going to look any younger by using this product , but we will look healthier because our skin will be healthier that said , this cream is definitely not greasy , and applies easily it is a definite indulgence at its price range , but quality definitely beats quantity and you get a quality product here allergy free as well speaking of which , i'm going to take off a star due to the lack of definitive info on whether or not the product line is we try not to buy products , especially cosmetics that are tested using animals \( not a good thing \)
5	very beautiful excellent company
5	i am a big fan of using powder to help set liquid makeup previously , i was using the expensive department store brands well , i am happy to say that dermablend works just as well , if not better than those brands why i love this product it makes my skin look flawless my skin looks very smooth and even toned it lasts i apply a dusting of powder first thing in the morning and it lasts all day the color is a perfect match for my skin i highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to have smooth looking skin
3	i rarely find an anti aging product that does n't cause me to breakout this detox lotion has not caused any issues after a week of use i noticed a difference the first night that i used it in the morning my skin looked a little fresher a week later , i have n't seen any more improvement than that it is a nice lotion that has helped a little but nothing to justify the price i looked well rested after my normal 8 hours of sleep but after a 7 hour night of sleep , i looked like a as usual i think the bottle will last a while , you do n't need to use much of this there is no extra benefit if you use a lot to use , you just twist the top and the dispenser pops up when done , turn it back and the dispenser is hidden again it is kind of a neat feature i will keep using to finish the bottle but unless it works a miracle , i ca n't see spending 75 for just a little improvement
5	i ca n't stop using this !
5	this works well for my baby 's sensitive skin it is not as thick as other brands and seems to have more of the protecting ointment as well as the zinc i use this at bedtime since she is in one overnight diaper all night it does a good job of keeping her rash free i like this product and will continue to use it !
5	this set of grooming implements is of the highest quality imaginable made by zwilling , a german company that makes an interesting assortment of tools for personal and household usage my first impression of this set of tools has held true , they are of the finest construction and built to last zwilling ja henckels is a company that 's probably more well known with their kitchen , i have both in my kitchen by this brand and adore my set of i find this grooming set to be top notch in the same way , with stainless steel and elegant construction that sets these tool apart from comparable cheaper brands an entire set of tools this kit nail file , cuticle pusher , nail clipper , pointed tweezers , and facial hair scissors in a high quality leather case all of the tools are easy to use , and i especially love the nail clippers which are a bit unusual looking , but are very sharp and work very well i find that it 's easier to the nail on each side then work towards the center to prevent tearing the fingernail , which does the trick with these clippers the file is also excellent to down and smooth the nails , it looks like a diamond file the rest of the kit is also very quality pointed tweezers \( awesome for pulling out as well as hair particularly ingrown hair \) , cuticle pusher , and scissors with a safety edge to prevent the skin a cute set of basic tools on a key ring is also included for day to day this set should last many years and would make a wonderful gift for both men \( the target for this grooming set \) and women highly recommended !
3	this shampoo is featured to do some nice stuff , but there is just one problem it is irritating it did not irritate my scalp , but my eyelids and neck started to burn seconds after this shampoo made contact with those parts it did not get into my eyes , but i hate to imagine what it would have felt like if that did happen the burning sensation went away several minutes after rinsing it off as far as my hair and scalp are concerned , it did a very good job cleaning , perhaps too good my hair seemed dry but no worse otherwise i do n't know what ingredient caused the burning sensation , maybe the peppermint oil the scent was fine i do not really recommend this product over other more suitable ones
5	this cream is very moisturizing without being greasy it sinks in and keeps skin looking soft and supple it does not break me out like most moisturizers or heavy night creams have in the past the scent is very pleasant and it does n't take a lot to do the job skin is looking much better after only 2 weeks of use ! ! you can also layer this under your makeup if your skin is very dry and it sinks in and does n't affect foundation at all love the results !
5	just starting to use no irritation after several uses i think it will work as expected \( which will be lovely \)
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	a great scent and not overbearing
5	i used this kit yesterday and today my hair is smooth and soft and definitely a lot stronger i used 1 2 ounce of 1 with 3 ounces of water \( you can use less if your hair is short or more if it 's longer \) and applied it to dry hair i left this on for a couple of hours and then applied 2 directly on top and left the mixture on for another couple of hours i then shampooed and applied a hydrating mask for about 45 minutes with heat i then rinsed for a full five minutes and then applied my regular styling products and let my hair air dry overnight this morning my hair is in great shape and it looks and feels very healthy , almost like virgin hair my hair is color treated and i also have highlights and although my colorist uses olaplex , it is also quite damaged from aggressive heat styling in addition , i 've had a small amount of breakage recently so i needed this olaplex treatment because it can stop breakage cold when i combed my hair yesterday after this two step treatment , i had absolutely zero breakage my hair is very smooth and the ends no longer look or but now lay smooth and flat i will continue to use 1 and 2 regularly , which will only improve my hair 's condition i recommend this kit for anyone with damaged hair but if your hair is not damaged , olaplex will not make any difference i do recommend using a hydrating mask afterward because olaplex can sometimes leave hair feeling dry you can also do an intensive protein treatment after olaplex but before the mask this will restore even the most damaged hair to a healthier state following this olaplex stand alone treatment with protein and moisture is recommended on the company 's website you can of course add 1 to color or bleach but you 'll want to bump up the strength of the because olaplex slows processing time , especially for bleach i got this kit from my stylist and i would be leery of ordering it on amazon , where fakes however , read the reviews thoroughly and if possible order it through prime , that way you can return it if it does n't look right the olaplex labels are easily so you need to make sure the bottles are sealed and that there is an instruction manual in the package there should also be a measuring device for the bottle of 1 hope you like it as much as i do
