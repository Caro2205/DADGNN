5	very nice
5	i love the hot tools brand and this one curling iron is great i 'll have to put this one away since i had my hair cut short i 'll save it when my hair is longer
5	this moisturizer is lightweight and blended into my skin very well left it moist and dry at the same time i used it under makeup no problems this lotion did not give me any irritation i have fair skin , clear \( for the most part \) and sensitive i am also mid thirties and female
2	the sprayer is not a very fine mist and it 's too expensive
4	when i ordered this lip gloss lip lacquer , i was mistaken about the color this was not the right shade for me i have an olive complexion and this was way too pink so , i it to her friend , and this review is based on her feedback with a little of my own when asked , the following were her 1 color \? did you like the color , and what skin tones would you recommend for it \? i liked the color , but think that \( shade 04 \) would go best with fair skin tones i would not recommend it for olive or brown complexions i agree , i have an olive to cinnamon complexion , and this was not a good color for me it looked like i dipped my lips in a shade that was between pepto bismol and cotton candy that may be an , but you get my but when my friend put it on \( and she is fair with red hair no doubt \) , it was perfect it merely accentuated her features , and did n't them 2 how long does the color last \? it lasted for several hours , and i was pleased with longevity this product does stain the lips slightly 3 how did it feel when applied \? it has a wonderful , creamy texture it is easy to apply , but a little messy it runs a bit , and it is kind of difficult to correct errors \( because it does stain \) , so be careful when applying 4 did you notice any difficulties while wearing this product \? no , with the exception of it being a little sticky if the wind is blowing , my hair does occasionally get caught in it and will occasionally drag the color across my face 5 does it have an unpleasant taste or smell \? nope and nope 6 what did you think of the packaging \? no complaints the container is basic but attractive \( clear with a black top \) you can see the color better in person than on line 7 would you pay 20 for it \? well , 20 is a little steep i 'd probably pay 10 8 how would you compare the quality of this product to others that you can buy in the mall or the drug store \? i think its higher quality than most drug stores \( lasts longer and nicer packaging \) , but not as nice as the mall stuff \( i e , the stickiness of it and it runs \) overall , we both give the japonesque \( shade 4 \) lip lacquer 4 out of 5 stars
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	i generally dislike wearing any kind of polish on my nails , but my nails are very weak and prone to breaking and chipping i was pretty desperate and more than willing to give this product a chance despite my dislike of polish it goes on easily and dries quickly i found that it does help prevent breaking and chipping , and it only adds a light pink see through coat to your nails , almost a natural color with a bit of gloss i would recommend trying this product if you have nails that break easily my nails are not thin , but they break if you look at them wrong and i found this product to be helpful
5	this really does work and i will be using this for a very long time i bought a stainless steel plate about 2 x 2 a few years ago and have been using that until now this is so much easier to use as it shaped like a bar of soap and is easier to use than that steel plate i made a vegetable soup this weekend and i always put in about 7 cloves of garlic and this took the smell right off my hands it was really nice to be able to use this in between cutting onions , garlic , , and those are pretty stinky and i hate having to have my hands smelling like them for hours after i peel and them up my hands were nice and clean and fresh smelling after getting my soup put together i would buy this in a heartbeat
3	hard to get a shade to match \( and complement \) one 's skin , june 26 , 2017 it is hard to find the shade s that match and complement your skin what is especially tricky is figuring out now the rosy undertones \( or yellow undertones \) affect how , ultimately , a particular shade looks on one 's skin i wound up having to blend too different shades , which i do n't view as a viable path forward the good quality of this make up really is off set by the of the shades
5	this is in the top 4 or 5 of my favorite bronzers for contouring , and bronzing my face it 's the perfect shade , it 's not shimmery , and it does n't look orange or muddy it 's a nice size you get a good amount of product the packaging is nice because it 's not bulky , and you can easily toss it in your makeup bag \( packaging is important to me ! \) i wish they sold this without the packaging , and offered refills , so i could put it in my z palette i feel like the packaging is a waste i just end up tossing it ! i'm all about my products these days
3	i really like the scent this candle gives off it burns well and evenly and seems like it has a nice long life the only caveat i have is that it set off the smoke in my apartment this is the first candle i 've ever owned to do this , so i'm not sure what 's up with that i had burned it before and no problem , but the other day it happened and i was quite surprised i 'll continue to monitor and update the rating if it continues to be a problem a week later this candle seriously smokes while i enjoy the scent , the only place i could use this is outside due to potential smoke problems
4	this is a great smelling body mist the fragrance is not overly powerful , and does n't last long if not for that i 'd give it 5 stars my wife loves it but also has the same complaint it does n't very long it mists nicely and without putting out too much so you are n't drenched in body mist the bottle is nice and easy to hold my wife also likes to spray it on the bed
5	i started using shellac again after a few years , and the product would peel off my nails so i bought new base and top coats problem solved ! the manicure stays for two weeks
1	i got this serum from vichy website am using it for already a month and got 0 difference
2	i used to love super goop but they changed the formula , i think it is now super stinky and the consistency is strange runny and not lotion like its a shame because i have had three of these pumps over the last couple of years but i'm not buying again
5	almost all of the face wash i own has some sort of acid in it i guess that is the it thing since i do home chemical peels i find using my peel along with the face wash with an acid in it is a little too much for my skin for the first day or so since this is a gentle cleanser it works perfectly with my skin for the first few days after the chemical peel the first day i use my finger tips to wash my face , then i use the clarisonic both ways works great for removing makeup thoroughly the bottle is a plastic squeeze bottle and the face wash is a thick liquid gel so it dispenses easily since it 's so thick , you only need a very little bit it also smells very clean
5	i get post partem hair loss when my babies are 3 4 months old this time was worse than last time and i had actual bald spots along with thinning right at the front of my hairline ! this stuff is great you could n't see the bald spots and it seemed to thicken the new baby hairs growing back in i bought the applicator and it worked great i am now at 7 months post partem and i do n't need to use it as much , but i still have about half the container left i will save it for my next baby the only thing i will mention is that these fibers do cling so , make sure to shake your head a bit , maybe finish getting ready and then wipe off your face and clothes if you have to also , i have very dark hair and used the dark brown color , so i ca n't rate the other colors
5	good
3	this color is not as vibrant as expected from online photos please note
4	i love the color of this eye liner but i do n't feel like it lasts very long in the waterline and that 's what i wanted it for
4	when i use l'occitane products i feel like i'm using top quality ingredients , and this almond skin oil is not exception it feels and smells luxurious the oil comes in a glass bottle and sprays onto the skin i wish the bottle came with a pump instead of a spray mechanism , as i think it would be easier to handle maneuvering a glass bottle with oil on your hands can get slippery , quickly , and i'm afraid of dropping this on the bathroom floor once on the skin it sinks in quickly , and has a light almond scent in cold weather do n't count on this as your sole moisturizer , but it works well to form a base protective layer
3	nice fragrance but no lasting power
5	fills in those thin spots nicely great for men or women
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	great summer color new nail polish dries so much better very happy with color it was a risk online i love all things hot pink and this is true to family yipppee
5	perfect color
5	goes on very smoothly and does n't cake or look dry i like the marbled appearance , it allows it to blend much smoother i first used this alone , just to see how well it covers and it did a great job , just looked a little too light , even on my fair skin then i tried it again but this time over the light foundation i wear and found that it worked well to cover uneven spots but with it the cakey look that a lot of people want to avoid
4	this is a really good size tub of body scrub i love the feel of the sugar and oils , but the scent , though pleasant , is a bit strong my only peeve with it is that the oils , while feel great in the shower , tend to leave my skin feeling a bit too oily for my liking , after using it , i ended up using a wash over my skin to take away some of that feeling my skin is not that dry that i need the extra oil , otherwise a great beauty product that did leave my skin soft i probably will only use it maybe once a week
5	my boyfriend loves it ! i also love it ! it totally softens his facial hair and also leaves a very soothing and sexy smell he said it also made his skin softer , too
5	i love all cosmetic products that are cruelty free not tested on animals \( \) and oribe glaze for beautiful color fits the bill i have silver hair and wash it daily although the effects of this conditioner are touted to last one week i generally do n't bother with conditioners but am very pleased with the results of using this on my short hair i imagine that it produce spectacular results on long hair even the box the glaze is packaged in is made from recycled materials and may itself be recycled my hair feels soft and is shiny this is a great product
5	hair looks great !
5	this color is so pretty , even on my skin tone , which is super duper pale be aware though it takes like 5 coats to get a really opaque look
4	this self tanner has a light fruity fragrance that is superior to most the color over the ten hours following application i am very fair and applied this to my legs after exfoliating i washed off after forty five minutes initially , there was little difference but as the color developed there was a noticeable difference i applied with a mitt \( not included \) and it was on a par with other products it does not stain clothing or bedding the end result was acceptable unlike many self tanners , this one contains olive tones instead of the awful orange it was okay on my legs but i would n't use it on my face the greenish tinge is flattering on my skin tone my sister , who has a medium olive complexion , much better and loved the results neither of us experienced any unpleasant side effects if you are looking for a tanner that leaves the orange out , this one is worth a try 3 5 stars
4	compared with jack black 's body building hair gel with grapefruit and ginger which i obtained at the same time this product is the hands down winner , providing a stronger hold that i can throughout the day without being concerned about of my short , fine hair separating and onto my forehead while the pomade does n't smell as good as the hair gel , it nevertheless has a similar , muted fragrance that improves over what other brand pomades have to offer in that department although my favorite hair holding products are those in the layrite line , they do n't have any particularly captivating fragrances like this one does i would definitely get this again
5	i 've been using this product for 14 years great product ! i only found out recently that i can get it cheaper on amazon
4	i love the art of shaving products , the sandalwood is my favorite scent of theirs and it makes shaving less annoying the balm really helps and makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized i will say my absolute are the soothing mint kinds but this is good and will do do n't mind the price , it is a lot
4	the make cosmetics dual phase eye makeup remover is fairly pricey eye makeup remover the size is smaller than i thought it 'd be but it is a nice , gentle formula that works really well there is no harsh chemical smell and does n't even irritate a small dry spot near my eye it 's definitely nicer than drug store brands so , if it 's worth a price tag for you , this is a good product
5	good skin care
5	liquid foundation application is very smooth only a small amount is needed as i applied too much the first time i used it and had to wipe some off i like the sunscreen protection which is so important today
5	i love dermablend get great coverage it goes on smoothly and stays with you all day i have tried many of their products and i have not had any breakouts or irritations you can build your foundation with this if you have a problem area , simply apply small amounts until you become happy with the area i think you will be satisfied with their product and they offer several shades to meet your needs i always set this foundation with the loose translucent setting gives you a very finished look which i just love
5	perfect for fall winter !
5	not much to say , since it is just a face wash i ca n't blame it solely for my face clearing up however , i am using an acne medicine that has over dried my face , and this has been a real life saver ! it does n't dry out my skin more , and leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean i use this as a night time face wash so i first use a makeup wipe \( mostly just for my eye makeup so it does n't get in my eyes \) then i wash my face with this
4	this is my favorite hair mask at the moment my hair stylist had introduced me to moroccan oil \( the actual hair oil \) and so i decided to also give the mask a try and i really like it first of , it smells wonderfully and i could almost use it just for that but more importantly , it seems to be just right for my hair which is short and highlighted and dry it definitely needs moisture but is also easily over cared for , and then usually has no body and needs to be washed too frequently the intense hydrating mask solves these seemingly problems it nourishes my hair and gives it much needed moisture , but on the other hand has none of the negative effects other masks and conditioners tend to have which eventually weigh down my hair i have been using the mask once a week , sometimes even twice a week and am still extremely happy with the results i definitely recommend this product although it really is pricey thankfully it lasts for quite a while as one does n't need much per application
5	i am 41 years ago and have fine , brown hair that is colored blonde despite coloring my hair since the age of 13 , i have never had any problems with breakage i began to notice that my hair was falling out the amount of hair in the shower drain in 2 days was the equivalent of what i saw in a month before ! also , i noticed that i could see more scalp my hair was falling out and breaking i went to the doctor and was diagnosed with while waiting for the tests and the meds , i wanted to do something to stop the breakage and keep what was left of my hair i did not buy this product on amazon \( yet , will buy a refill here shortly \) as i bought it from my hair salon that carries lanza products after washing and drying your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner , you put this on damp hair i have a short bob \( hair comes to the top of my shoulders \) and i use enough to equal about the size of a quarter you rub this into your hair while it 's damp and dry as usual this stuff is amazing within 48 hours of using this , my hair breakage was reduced by 60 within 1 week of using this , my hair breakage was reduced by 90 it has almost no smell to it it 's not like any other oil that you have tried this is not greasy at all my hair dresser actually had me test it on my hands first , to demonstrate that it 's not greasy it absorbed into my skin within 5 minutes with no greasy feeling at all my hair is shiny , not weighed down and strong my breakage had almost disappeared as a result of using this product it was not the meds i did n't even start them for 4 weeks although it is only advertised as a product for your hair , i rub the residue on my elbows after i apply it my chronically dry elbows are no more ! note i did use this in combination with the lanza strength shampoo and conditioner these are also great products , but through process of , i determined that this is the key to reduced breakage this product works great ! and , this is a great price on amazon they sell this for twice this price in the salon i will be buying my refill from here going forward and , in this version , you are getting twice the size with a pump \( as opposed to a screw off top \) which is great be sure to check the pricing on the 3 4 oz in order to ensure that you are purchasing this at a fair price
5	the hardest part of using the wow shampoo was getting it out of the tube nothing would come out no matter how hard i squeezed of course , i finally realized that it had with a seal inside the cap with that problem solved , the wow emerged as a clear liquid , which i rubbed into my hair i have been using the wow without a conditioner , although it would be interesting to try the wow conditioner too the wow leaves my hair smooth and shiny it may take a while for me to determine how well the color will last while using wow , but so far , so good
5	i am very particular about the lotion i use i have a low tolerance for greasy lotion this lotion is not at all it smells amazing \( ! \) and it dries without any greasiness the scent is not overpowering but has a nice flowery smell despite the higher end price , it 's worth it a little goes a long way so it will last a couple months at least with daily use
5	it was a gift to my girlfriend and she loves it she wears it all the time she loves the color and it stays on for a while
5	i am loving the la roche product line it is a bit pricey though i want to re order this , but i 'll have to save up this is such a nice lotion i put it on my cleansed clean face last night and woke up with the softest , most refreshed skin that i 've been able to achieve in a while i have some dry patches that are really hard to find a good lotion that wo n't irritate my sensitive skin this however , absorbs into my skin beautifully without a greasy or heavy feeling do n't get me wrong , the product is thick , but it absorbs very nice , without a sticky feel there is n't an odor to it i really love it it has helped my dry areas literally overnight with continued use , i can only imagine how nice my skin will look and feel highly recommend !
4	i'm 40 years old with very sensitive skin that is oily in hot months and dry flaky in cold months this moisturizer was perfect for my skin during winter because it 's rich and creamy without feeling heavy my skin felt moisturized and healthy without out any allergic reactions or breakouts i must admit that i had hoped this product would soften the lines on my forehead but it did n't however , i would still recommend this product to people with dry skin because it truly helped my skin to look supple and feel wonderful during winter when my skin would normally be dry and flaky
3	a bit pricey but it 's good for refreshing your hair when it 's a little oily therefore you get a bit of volume to otherwise limp hair between washings i'm not a big fan of the smell because it 's a bit strong for my liking , but it does n't leave any residue or flakes which is a plus
5	love this color so far it 's been over a week and no chips
3	i used this cream twice daily as directed and it does leave your skin silky soft with a smoother appearance just do n't expect a breast lift from its use ! it is a pink cream that absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind i however could n't stand the smell , felt it was too strong , specially when it 's so close to your nose
2	excited to try it based on reviews , but find it to be a poor cleanser little baby acne since starting using this , very dry skin , and my face looks dirty right after shower i will just stick to a dove for men soap bar as it is far superior for cleaning the face and making it look nice and clean way overpriced for what you get , but everyone is different what does n't work for me might work for you side note i find jack black products to be extremely overpriced when they all seem to be mediocre products
5	great clean
4	i had great results i took close up before and after pictures and was shocked at the difference with a little more than a week of using it im an almost 60 year old new england woman with generally well kept skin thats outdoors daily and i have average wrinkles for my age i used a tiny dab as instructed and applied it to outer edges of my eyes , outside edge of my forehead , and around my nose lip area mostly once a day sometimes twice a day as instructed , i left it on by itself before applying anything else my experience , which i have not seen this reported anywhere else , is that my skin flaked a bit on the first few applications it slightly stung at first be careful and do n't get it too close to your eyes i was skeptical , so i read all the reviews here and googled it to see what other sources said the dermatology review has a good explanation of what this product is about it includes user reviews there too and its a mixed bag , some love this and have amazing results , others nothing i also read this on the consumer health website similar information , saying results can appear faster for some they also add that the company , does appear to be a very reputable company who provides good customer care yes , its pricey at this rate the tube will last a few months
5	this is a great light almost nude color i received this polish very quickly great fall color love essie polish
5	i love euphoria but it is a little heavy so i only wear it during the colder months or for date night the new endless euphoria is much lighter a sweet floral that 's perfect for spring or summer i really like this new scent but it might be a little too sweet for some your best bet is to smell a sample before making up your mind
4	have had persistent skin issues for a while now with irritated patches and on sides of face so picked up this cream actually it is something between a cream and a lotion to calm my face and make it more comfortable this is why this works for me o no redness or reaction upon application o aloe vera gel listed as second ingredient \( main ingredient \) o jojoba oil o avocado oil and o shea butter also many organic ingredients included as well ginger root , rice bran extract and green tea if there is a fragrance , this nose fails to detect it must note , however , being very dry do n't find this adequate as a moisturizer , however also , labeling suggests using this as a night cream , but hydration offered is not on a par with night creams which are usually heavier and more oily to amp up , mixed it with some olive oil say 4 5 drops , and that really did the trick definitely think this works to calm your face , which is a great for all those guys with post shave irritation
5	while i am not a fan of some of dermablend 's other products \( their foundation in a tube products \) , the cover crme line excels it applies easily , and a small application covers very well you do n't really notice it on your face , and it does n't get cakey like anything else , you need to determine the best shade for you it looks like dermablend has over 20 shades , and the ones i have used tend to match the sample color on the website fairly close keep in mind your tones on your display monitor will heavily influence that dermablend does have a nice color selector tool on their website the broad spectrum spf 30 properties are , of course , great for protecting your skin like most dermablend products , the cover crme line is pricey , but it is a very nice cream foundation it wears exceptionally well , stays put , and also cleans up pretty easy with water , soap , and wipes even though dermablend recommends using a setting powder , i find it holds up very well for hours without it
3	this eau de toilette comes packaged and has a very appealing woodsy , manly scent when first sprayed , but quickly dissipates into a sweet smelling after scent that smells nothing like it did straight from the bottle quite frankly the scent is way too powdery sweet with rather old tones once it settles on my husband , and does not live up to his expectations , nor mine there are a lot better scents out there in this price range
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	creamy and smooth , this cleanser does a great job removing makeup i do n't wear a lot , but it removes every i have n't used it long enough to notice any long term skin benefits , so i ca n't say much about that this does seem to be far more expensive than some very similar products that are creamy and remove makeup without drying your skin i have n't experienced any break outs or irritation , which is a plus it is creamy during use , rinses completely and leaves my skin feeling soft without an oily residue if you are budget conscious you will likely want to keep looking , but this is nice
5	having thin weak nails my whole life \( and i'm no spring \) this is the only thing that works on my nails it is lovely and i have tried several colors this one being one of the first the iced cappuccino has a lovely full blended look and is a very attractive neutral shade in my opinion i have tried the pinks \( light and dark ones \) and the reds \( which are currently my ! \) and this is a tried and true when in doubt color for sure it is most appropriate for those who need subtle color on their nails for work or simply prefer a neutral shade i used to be that woman try this and it will make you a believer my nails are harder and stronger i am not kind to my nails and computer work and paper dry them out not to mention the arid area of my state does n't help ! \( yes texas has some arid parts ! \) i have moved furniture , done yard work , cleaned , washed and so forth with not a care in the world on the nails be sure you use a professional and get one who has bottle shaker it will help keep your polish looking great for two weeks at least !
5	holy crap this stuff is amazing ! i had a blemish forming so i tried a dab of this on top instead of my usual go to solution for blemishes i did a small dab , just enough to cover the area overnight the zit which was starting to form completely shrunk ! the next night a second dab did the trick to shrink it the rest of the way and it was gone by the third day completely i highly recommend this for someone who is looking for something to act quickly
5	i love this shea butter you need very little and it is very moisturizing without being greasy as long as you do n't use too much i know refined shea butter is supposed to be inferior to raw shea butter , but i'm not expecting an anti aging miracle , i just want a solid moisturizer this can feel grainy but once it warms up that disappears
3	this is a lightly sweet , floral fragrance it 's rated as an eau de parfum , which should be less concentrated than perfume , but stronger than eau de toilette however , my wife feels that it is a much weaker scent than some of the typical eau de toilette fragrances she uses with 6 sprays onto her clothing , it was barely noticeable \( smelling the clothes skin directly \) 3 hours later even though its supposed to be more concentrated , it did not seem to last very long or have a strong scent to begin with i do n't like a fragrance that is overpowering , but of course you want to notice it i do like the scent itself but my wife would not choose this as a summer fragrance \( as it is advertised \) , but thought it was ok for evening wear in the semi tropical climate where we live
4	the fragrance is pleasing and not overpowering the glass holder is very pretty and looks nice placed anywhere however , i personally could never pay that much for a candle i occasionally buy candles from bath and body works for half the price and i am just as happy with theirs this candle says that its made from , black , and other fruits , but to me , the smell is not fruity but more floral , which was unexpected but it still smells great
2	i have sensitive skin and a sensitive nose i was not able to use this product because the smell irritates my sinuses i was not expecting this because other reviewers had written that the scent was light and pleasant since my skin is sensitive , i tested this product on the skin of my arm , planning to leave it on overnight to watch for any irritation unfortunately , fumes rose into my nose immediately and i felt a headache coming so i rinsed my arm off then i went to bed , but had trouble going to sleep because i could still smell it and my sinuses felt very irritated this seemed odd because the smell seemed flowery , like roses , and should have been pleasant i do n't know why it bothered me so strongly but i would not dare put this on my face ! on the plus side , the formula is paraben free and many people seem to like it however , it also contains a list of chemicals , some of them questionable here 's the list from the manufacturer 's site aqua water glycerin alcohol denat prunus kernel oil apricot kernel oil isononyl isononanoate polysorbate 20 niacinamide dimethicone propanediol isopropyl lauroyl peg 20 methyl glucose ammonium polyacryldimethyltauramide ammonium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate bht c13 14 isoparaffin ci red 33 ci yellow 6 triethanolamine caffeine sodium hyaluronate phenoxyethanol adenosine tocopheryl acetate disodium edta salicylic acid caprylyl glycol laureth 7 xanthan gum polyacrylamide methyl methacrylate chloride copolymer parfum fragrance 10 bht is , a controversial ingredient it 's generally derived from petroleum the says hazardous in case of skin contact \( irritant \) , of \( irritant \) that applies to using it full strength , which is not the case in this formula other questionable ingredients include denatured alcohol and polyacrylamide i hope this is helpful to somebody
5	i love everything about this toner it feels smells great , i ca n't put my finger on what the smell is but it 's a clean natural scent a little goes a long way it definitely tones i love the entire pca line have found that used in conjunction with their other products , the benefits are greater
5	was exactly the color i was looking for perfect smooth application
5	this is the perfect medium brown color for fall very polished look , and a great change from the normal bright colors
4	if you 're looking for a nice moisturizer with sun screen that does n't have much of that scent , this is a good one not too sure about the , but the first time i tried it , i was amazed at how quickly it was absorbed and that it has n't felt greasy at all , nor has my skin felt dry while wearing it it provides decent coverage on that front , and a little does go a long way spf 15 is n't the strongest sun protection out there , but it can add up if you 're using other make up that provides additional protection
5	very happy with this product ! i have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin in just a week i love all the pevonia products !
5	this product is def in the current rotation i can feel the lift and i love it maybe it 's the caffeine but this product takes care of the puffiness for sure
5	dead sea essentials foot cream is wonderful ! ! ! i had rough , dry feet to the point i was embarrassed now after using this cream for a couple of weeks , my feet are soft and smooth i look good in my i will keep an extra tube on hand cause i do n't want my feet to look that bad again i love this cream
4	i took this because i am tired all the time and i need all the refreshing that i can get when i got it i closed my eyes and sprayed my neck and face it felt good and it has a mild citrus scent to it i guessed that it had water in it and that that is the first ingredient some of the ingredients are not familiar to me but the ones that are besides the water are licorice , a form of chamomile , cranberry fruit extract , garlic bulb extract soy and wheat protein and root extract if you are allergic to soy or wheat , you may not want to try it you are not supposed to spray it in your eyes but if you do accidentally , wash them out with water i do not like the price of it that is my only negative if i was still working , i would pop it into my purse and use it when i feel
5	i do n't wear a lot of makeup or tend to spend money on it , so my usual concealer is an inexpensive store brand i was always happy with it , but i much prefer the japonesque concealer now that i 've tried it the concealer is very smooth and creamy and comes in a cute little case being a natural redhead , my skin is quite fair but the 02 shade works well for me i had to purchase a small brush to use with the concealer , but the brush makes the application easy and effective i 've used it for small spots as well as to even my skin tones over larger areas , and it works well for both i do n't use foundation , but after applying the concealer i use powder and the finished effect is very even and holds up well over the course of the day
5	wow i never really had a product like this i think my skin actually looks better i never cared very much about my skin but one of my new years was to start taking care of my skin i got a clarisonic and some products really none of them remove makeup as gently and effectively as this product this is a great product and i'm actually going to buy some for my best friend , who is into makeup big time and i think she would benefit from this
5	i really find a good cleanser which is not to drying and not too greasy my skin is definitely gotten way drier as i 've gotten older and this is perfect for me pleasant and effective in every way great value for the price
3	i was excited to receive this product , since it is in the luxury beauty section of amazon well , my experience with this cream has been lackluster for the price point i was hoping for some real , measurable results i prefer to wear my workhorse moisturizers at night , since that is the optimal time for these products to work , but this has a spf 30 if you would prefer to wear it during the day instead the cream is thick , with barely a fragrance , and it soaks into the skin pretty quickly i also noticed that when worn under makeup , it gave my skin , especially the eye area , a sheen that looked as if i were wearing highlighter so that was a nice added touch as for performance , i really did n't notice a difference in my skin during or after wearing this i was putting this on nearly 40 skin , but maybe it would have more of an effect on mature skin as far as presentation goes , the container is fancy looking , and it comes with a little black spatula this product might be better suited to someone 50
4	the problem with hair color is that it leaves your hair looking flat and dull this color wow shampoo works very well to make your hair get back some of the shine it goes on easily and lathers very well it has a faint smell that is somewhat generic but pleasant it left my hair looking clean with a light sheen the only real downside to this product is its price i have purchased fekkai products which offer similar cleaning and shine yet are much cheaper than this this product is very good but the high price is hard to justify
4	i always use a serum before my moisturizing cream , but this is kind of like a serum and cream in one not quite a cream and not quite a gel , this drench quench is somewhere in between , but has a lot of the benefits of both i'm in my fifties so i like super hydration and this provides it my skin feels moisturized all day the smell is neutral , almost a light ocean fragrance , and very subtle , almost unnoticeable ultimately , i'm really frugal so the for me is always the price and though this is n't the cheapest product out there , it 's a substantial sized jar and it only takes a very small amount to cover my entire face and neck so it will last a long time and i do n't need a serum with it , so that saves , too all and all , after trying this as a sample , i would definitely buy it for my daily routine
4	love this color ! it 's so pretty and coraly goes with every skin tone
4	i was a bit nervous ordering this online its so hard to tell how a makeup color will look on you i am happy to say that this product looks very nice it gives a sheer tint and just a hint of color , which is exactly what i want my makeup to do while it glided on nicely to my cheeks , i did n't like the way it felt on my lips , so i will only use it as a blusher going forward the container is a bit small , so i do n't think it will last very long it is meant to be clicked together with other jouer products , which is kind of a neat idea i have light blond hair and very pale skin , and this shade was a nice fit for me
5	it is useful as it described
5	i bought this full size tube of avene rich hydrating cream after falling in love with a small sample tube that came in a subscription box at the time i received the sample , i was battling an unusual case of dry flaky skin that was embarrassing within a few days of regular use , my skin looked like new soft and clear the tiny sample lasted a long time , so i did n't hesitate to buy the full size tube even at this price i use this every morning and night after cleansing my face my skin stays soft , even with the dry winter skin and drying indoor heat my makeup glides on smoothly this is my go to moisturizer year round now another reviewer mentioned being concerned her product may be counterfeit i only buy products like this when it says sold by amazon and not a third party so i make sure i get authentic , fresh products every time
5	dermablend professional quick fix full coverage concealer brown \( \) is darker than a most popular medium beige , but it has an interesting application for concealing neutralizing makeup not by hiding blemishes and discoloration in order to achieve an almost perfectly uniform appearance , which is extremely rare and thus uncommon , but by greatly reducing their intensity to make them appearing like a natural variation of color typical to us additionally intensifying with aging it is especially useful to cover more reddish blemishes and discoloration , so the resulting hue , which is a product of making brown slightly more reddish , becomes a typical natural in other words , of 2 methods \( 1 \) to choose a color matching the complexion to cover entirely the discolorations , or \( 2 \) to choose the brown color and to cover the discolorations with a thinner layer showing slightly trough , the second is much cheaper , as using much less creme , and does not produce artificial , mask like effect , but requires more artist like skills and also use of setting powder on the top to finish and protect the result
1	i was so excited to see essie nail polish on amazon i thought i was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple i ca n't return it so i wasted 9 on this color that i will never wear i want my money back i always rave about essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos are n't accurate i guess i have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color
5	when i first put this on , i actually got a hint of fruitiness that i thought was a little strange \( not unpleasant , but strange \) however , after having had it on for most of the day , i am really liking it \( it did lose a bit of intensity so you may want to reapply through the day \) the product page describes this as solar oriental and that 's actually a really good description this has the sandalwood and woody notes i love in fragrances but this just has the feel of a daytime fragrance \( i am really not noticing the salt at all , although maybe that was part of my initial impression and those notes have worn off \? at any rate , i'm happy with what has stayed around after a few hours \) i do n't really notice the peppery qualities , either , but that may be my body chemistry at work the bottle design is attractive but a little obnoxious you have to twist the top pretty hard to get it off but i like the fragrance quite a lot please note that this item is flammable and can only be shipped via ground shipping methods , so it will take a longer time also , please note that it is probably not able to be returned so if you are unsure if you like this , i would suggest trying to find a sample first as of the time of this writing , amazon is the seller however , if a third party seller does add a listing and you plan to buy from them , check seller feedback before purchasing a seller with good feedback is more likely to send you a genuine item \( sadly , large bottles of designer perfumes are often so only purchase from sources \)
5	this is one of the better makeups i have found , it really covers up all the blemishes and spots and i am very happy with how smooth my skin looks it is a big difference when i wear this i have not had any reactions and it stays put for most of the day
3	highlight of this product is the pump on the bottle makes it easy to dispense in the shower are the price and the size of the bottle upon dispensing baxter of california daily protein shampoo i was pleasantly surprised at the fresh and minty fragrance that came out of it but was quickly brought back to reality when the shampoo gave my hair a stripped feeling basically gummy overall i would n't spend the money ,
3	i generally love l'occitane products , but these soap bars are not the best soap bars on the market they do n't lather much , they leave the face feeling taut , and unfortunately especially with lavender , which is l'occitane 's premier scent , not much scent is while you wash
3	this primer has no color i was expecting a slight nude color it came out clear to whitish it made my skin feel incredibly soft so , why the three stars \? it did nothing else for my face except make it itch ! now mind you , i have extremely sensitive skin extremely it may be just fine for someone else but , this is my review and it made my eyes itch so badly that they are swollen now ! i have eczema , though like i said it may be fine for someone else i did not feel as though this product did anything in the way of priming my skin it made it feel soft did nothing for the small and fine wrinkles did nothing for the open pores why would i want to use it \? i did not wear it alone i put makeup over it as i do with all my facial primers this one is a definite do n't buy
3	with a career in television news , i have pretty much tried every mascara out there the vincent longo volume plus mascara turned out to be ok a good basic , everyday mascara the mascara wand itself is thinner than my usual brand \( l'oreal voluminous \) so i was skeptical about the application coverage but once i tried it , i was impressed this went on very easily without any clumps or smears i liked the way it looked if you prefer a more natural look but if you are looking for more dramatic volume , you will be disappointed factoring in the price , i gave this three stars since you can find something similar in your local drug store for much less
4	my wife loves it and i like it she likes it largely because juicy couture is fresh and hip right now i like the lightness of the scents , and the more fruity notes the perfume al little goes a long way and it seems to last for most of the day
2	i bought this bronzer because in the package it did n't look the least bit orange however , upon application it was most definitely orange packaging can be deceptive ! this is disappointing because every bronzer i 've tried thus far , from high end to low end , has ended up orange , if not immediately then after a few hours of wear i guess it is that i do n't like the look of bronzer , i prefer just blush what a waste of cash ! i wanted something that would my cheekbones and give me a nude look but it 's as orange as can be and makes me look way too made up now i have a somewhat expensive makeup item that i ca n't do a thing with i bought it on vacation in san and ca n't return it anywhere what a shame ! i 'll find someone to give it to i simply have no use for yet another bronzer that 's as orange as a pumpkin ! i definitely do n't recommend this product
5	love this color i get lots of compliments on it
5	i use a lot of zoya nail polish and have recently become with yellow polish this i a color that i use a lot it 's like bottle of sunshine excellent , smooth formula 2 coats on this one perfection long wearing , chip free perfect another zoya winner !
4	i was initially irritated because the product offered no instruction on how to open the package be warned that you ca n't just take the bottle out of the box and expect it to work you will need to screw down the applicator so it will punch open a hole once that was accomplished i tried a small amount on my skin i do n't have lots of dark spots on my face , but i do have some on my hands that i would like to eliminate or at least fade fortunately , no skin reactions , but also no miracles yet the changes are said to happen over a longer period of time i will update as i continue to use i am supposed to use this twice a day not sure i'm going to do that because i really do n't like the scent yuck way too overpowering for a skin cream i 'd prefer this product have no scent or go with something much more subtle
3	as reported by my wife this cream really has a rich texture as it states , and does moisturize skin very well the algae extract in this cream is supposed to help immediately tighten skin there was no uncomfortable tightness , but neither were there any signs of desired tightening mainly i chose this cream because it said it is for sun damaged skin we live in a hot sunny place , and neck skin usually shows early signs of aging , so i was hoping for resulting skin texture improvement the package says it is allergy tested , but my neck got pretty red and irritated however it must be the niacin in this cream that causes this reaction , and is not really considered as an allergic reaction this cream is very similar to strivectinlabs extreme cream which i tried before this cream i had a severe reaction with strivectinlabs extreme cream and could not use it at all this nia24 cream created a milder reaction , and i was hoping to continue using it and that my skin would adjust , as the packaging suggests it suggests using this product for 7 10 days and that pro niacin may cause slight warmth and blushing on application , but for me after 2 weeks skin my skin is still reacting and staying red i apply it only in the evening but my neck is still reddish in the morning nevertheless , the skin texture seems to be improved i do n't normally have sensitive skin toward cosmetics , but consider your skin sensitivity if choosing this product if you can live with some redness , you will see some improvements for sure this gave better results than strivectin for a smoother , softer skin
5	it has cult status for a reason this stuff is incredible when im getting my regular period breakout \( a couple on the chin , a few near the hairline \) i bust this out as my last step before bed \( after moisturizer too \) and wow the next morning i always get results redness is gone and usually so is the offending zit i have wildly sensitive , oily skin , but this works wonders for me
5	awesome color !
2	i do like most la roche posay products however i am not fond of this it has a texture of creamy it has a nice , faint smell to it however it does not lather up i feel it does not cleanse my face very well i feel like it just moves around the makeup and it does not get off my primer on my eyes i have to use 3 pumps of this to put on my entire face to cleanse but it does n't leave my face feeling refresh and clean i will not purchase this product again because of these things
5	i do n't see any difference but they do feel nice and cooling while they are on and for a little while afterwards
4	this is a spray toner , not a lotion it is fabulous at reducing pores if you use it with a cotton pad rather than just spraying it on your skin for too long , i was just spraying it on my skin and yes , it had some effect , however , when i started using a pad , i saw a huge difference in the reduction in the size of my pores i am a fan of pevonia products as they are i use many of their products who knows why they call this a lotion maybe because it also helps soften our skin \? i also wish they would have left it in a clear bottle so we can tell when we are running low i mentioned this to pevonia to no avail
5	i did n't expect this product to be so awesome under eye concealers often make me look weird , even if they are the right color and match my skin they can be cakey and hard to apply evenly enter the wonderful scott vincent borba brush that comes with this creamy concealer the brush is amazing and the cone shape enables you to really get in the corner of your eye and smooth the concealer in a way that looks natural it is great for uneven pigmentation also and the brush gives a light touch the concealer itself is a great consistency , goes on well , blends into skin and makes me look so much more awake i love this product and use it every day even before i run
5	yes this is another color i bought very sexy and sultry and again flawless has its own sharpener also , forgot to mention , very handy good for any eye color any race will bring the real you forward and outside of yourself
5	love this color
5	i 've heard my dermatologist talk about this brand before \( she recommended it for sensitive skin \) but i was hesitant to try it and waste the money in case it did n't work for me so i am glad i was able to get the chance to review it i hope my review of this product will help you in making the right choice for yourself after breaking out while using many other sunscreens , i use this with great results i'm a busy mom of two little ones and needed something that worked well with a little tint this sunscreen which contains titanium dioxide \( 8 \) and zinc oxide \( 3 8 \) provides a bit of tint and color to my face i have olive skin and it 's the perfect match for me you 're supposed to put it on about 15 min before going out in the sun and reapply every two hours tizo is the only sunscreen that did n't cause little allergic reaction zits to pop up i'm so happy to have found it , and the tint just adds a little color to your face i love this stuff and it works so well
4	the first perfume i ever loved was des , and the lily of the valley scent still makes me feel about 11 years old , in a good way , not the mean girl middle school way this cream promotes itself as ultra moisturizing hand therapy \( also repeated in french on the reverse intense pour and of course it looks better in french \) if ultra moisturizing makes you wonder about greasiness , have no fear it is non greasy and quickly absorbed after a few minutes , the scent has largely dissipated , leaving you with softened hands my hands are in pretty good shape already since i try to avoid using them , so i do n't know if this cream would therapy for cracked or dried hands i also do n't know how the scent compares to that of the other 16 hand creams in the crabtree evelyn line , but i'm probably going to give some of them a try travel sizes tend to be expensive , and for about twice as much money you can get four times the amount of product that 's not bad for a premium brand the travel size is convenient my tube is setting next to my keyboard and the distinctive green color means that it 's easy to find all the other stuff that is sitting next to my keyboard i may become addicted
4	nice rich moisturizer for bedtime blends well into skin
3	different color , nice product
3	the color is a bit darker than what i expected and i feel like it is a fake essie bottle , because it is different from what i bought in cvs
3	i usually love mario badescu products but this one is n't as i expected first off , i hate the top there 's no easy way to use it you have to unscrew and remove the top and squeeze the bottle too much comes out i 'd prefer a flip top secondly , i hate the scent it 's overpowering i usually prefer something natural like an essential oil or no fragrance at all otherwise , it 's a nice face wash the ingredients are ok , though there are some questionable things in it it made my face feel clean and was n't drying i 'll continue to use it but it 's not a standout i would return for
4	this product is made by guthy renker , a company that you 'll encounter among the many infomercial beauty products this product came to me through amazon 's vine program , not through any type of subscription program so i'm commenting only on the product , not the company 's subscription practices \( for what it 's worth , i have to their products over the years , and found that they basically were legit perhaps people do n't read the fine print when they purchase the product or do n't cancel it through the proper speaking only for myself , i 've never had a problem with guthy renker \) as for the price , almost 70 , i think that 's a little high but everything beauty related seems high these days the exfoliator primarily seems to work through acrylates copolymer \( little bits of acrylic acid and acid building blocks \) it seems gentle enough for most skin areas , though you always want to be gentle with the delicate neck and chest skin area as a weekly , i tend to exfoliate with a loofah after swimming , so i do n't think the exfoliator is that useful for me for my neck and chest , i tend to use lactic acid or glycolic acid occasionally , followed by an emollient cream however you exfoliate , it is important if you want the skin to be able to receive moisturizing of any type the cream itself is very rich a little goes a long way the main ingredients are water \( aqua \) , butyrospermum parkii \( shea \) butter , theobroma cacao \( cocoa \) seed butter , \( coconut \) oil , olea europaea \( olive \) fruit oil , i pretty much have all those items in my cosmetics drawer \( or kitchen \) i usually keep a jar of shea butter by the , so i can massage some into my legs while watching tv in the kitchen , i 'll slather a bit of cocoa butter on my hands and arms we grew up with my mother putting olive oil and heat packs on our hair , so i'm accustomed to using olive oil as an emollient works great on skin , too so , overall , if you like things packed in nice little packages and being told exactly what to do , you might appreciate this kit otherwise , i think you can do just as well with good quality shea butter , cocoa butter , and olive oil and maybe some jojoba oil , too the main thing is not laying it on so heavily that your clothes end up more moisturized than your skin and to add after hydration , when the skin is plumped up
4	this is fragrant , but i love the fragrance it smells lightly of lemons and i think white flowers it 's a very feminine , energizing scent to me i noticed hours after application that i could still faintly smell the fragrance on my skin i think what i like best is it does n't smell like a banana or coconut or tropical drink it goes on as a white lotion with a pump top dispenser that is very easy to use it absorbs in and feels very silky it does contain dimethicone some may not like that it 's not my favorite ingredient but it 's ok to me in this often sunscreen will feel greasy to me , but this feels silky it has 3 sunscreen active ingredients for solid 30 spf protection , but it contains jojoba seed oil and vitamin e to keep skin in good shape while tanning a bit i love the fragrance effective sun protection that will allow tanning to happen safely i love that it feels silky at first but then as it goes away , it does n't attract dirt or dust like some sunscreens do i like the pump which gives out a perfect amount to minimize waste , and locks easy so it does n't leak out when traveling why not a 5 \? it 's expensive to only be 4 ounces , and i ca n't hardly read the bottle it 's got tiny gold print on brown
5	nice mix of products
5	5 stars i am hopeful will return with results
4	i like the color
4	let 's start with the appearance of this fragrance the box is pretty enough , and the bottle is gorgeous it 's 4 1 2 inches tall , with an icy , jewel like quality the eau de toilette inside is very faintly tinted violet there 's a tiny satin bow tied around its neck a really bottle , in my opinion , and one that would look beautiful on anyone 's vanity now on to the scent i saw some reviewers describing it as a grandma scent i do n't know what anyone else 's grandma smells like , but i got a completely different impression i would describe it as very young , very fresh , very early summer the scent makes me think of the month of may in a beach town with a sea breeze and faintly the air the top note is sharp citrusy once the fragrance has dried and settled , what 's left is sweet not cloying , but it 's lightly floral , ever so slightly powdery , spicy , somewhat aquatic its name , fresh , suits it perfectly this is a very sweet and , fragrance so much so that i feel it 's too young for me since rochas is a parisian house , i 'll use the french terms rochas fraiche is a scent for an , and i'm a woman age basically , i'm too mature for this bubbly concoction thinking of a 20th anniversary gift for your beloved wife \? skip this and get a , classic say , almost anything by chanel buying a first real perfume for a teenage girl or college \? someone full of , ready to take on the world but not ready to be too seductive \? this is perfect
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	i love this idea because i can use so many product if it is good , i will buy full size i think it will save my money
5	this is an awesome face wash my skin does n't feel dried out after i shower when using this product i read other reviews saying products from nivea are just as good at half the price have you read the ingredients in both \? not even close jack black is a premium wash and not some target walmart brand also , a little goes a long way i do n't need more than about a pea size amount as it lathers up richly a bottle lasts unless you 're over doing it highly recommended
3	nice color , takes 3 coats
5	bought this for my dad because he has oily , acne skin he loves it ! it smells nice and revives the skin while getting rid of the oil just do n't get it in your eyes cause u will be sorry !
5	hampton sun lives up to the claims on the can this mist is easy to apply \( i even got my back \) , produces beautiful non orangey color , and smells less like tanning stuff than other self tanners i 've tried so nice to be able to get a safe but natural looking tan ! i recommend this tanner !
4	i like using a tonic on my face instead of water because here in north east we have very hard water and it really dries out my face vichy essence water is a little heavier than your normal tonic , it 's not light you do n't spray it on your face you have to pour it out of the bottle its perfumed heavily , almost when i put it on my face i always need twice as much as a normal tonic because it seems to either disappear between my fingers on my phone or go and soak up immediately into my skin it 's just very odd the way it goes on my face also and i'm being maybe too honest here it does n't seem to maybe it 's my type of skin this essence water does not seem to like to work with \?
5	i have purchased mario badescu before i like that it works well with sensitive skin this one is almost gel like and it gets absorbed quickly and deeply very hydrating thanks !
4	with three teenage girls in the house , acne supplies are a must , and the reasons i ordered la roche posay effaclar 3 step system there are times when breakouts are worse than others are , as well as more crucial to be eliminated on special occasions such as school picture day my daughters are not fond of having a three step system for me , ten days seems like a rather long time to clear up acne however , if it is when on a permanent daily basis in keeping acne away , that is something to consider product description effaclar dermatological acne system treats blemish prone skin with a three step targeted system the first step skin of excess oil and tightens the pores , the second step gently exfoliates away dead , dull cells that can get trapped in pores and cause acne , and the third step treats and reduces acne in three days while minimizing irritation in just 10 days , la roche posay effaclar dermatological acne system reduces acne by 60 percent leaving a clear , healthy complexion medicated gel cleanser 3 4oz clarifying solution 3 4oz acne treatment 0 7oz brand story recommended by more than 25 , 000 dermatologists worldwide , la roche posay offers unique skincare developed with dermatologists for every skin type to complement treatments and promote good skincare practices at home every day
5	this is the best ever ! ! ! i have been searching for an awesome lip balm and i have found it ! it 's nourishing and has a light lemony scent my lips have improved tremendously since i started using this the name lives up to the product your lips literally drink it up i bought the buff color and it 's a nice neutral shade , highly recommend price was reasonable and as always super fast shipping
5	really works ! if you 've tried everything for clear skin , are allergic or sensitive , try it !
5	love this nail polish i have worn it more times than not already and it is my go to color of the summer
5	this product is really helping my cuticles and stopping dryness on the sides of my finger highly recommend it
1	this color is sheer 2 coats provides barely any coverage , more like it tints your nails lime green like they are stained i tried it on and ended up covering it with another color to complete my manicure really bad color , wish i never bought , will never wear
4	i love bliss products , but am often unwilling to spend the money this is a really nice gift set , and a better value for bliss i'm not sure i quite understand what the love does , needs to be used in conjunction with diet and exercise , well if i wanted to diet and exercise , i would n't be looking for a product to help with that area so i dropped it a star for that odd product kind of feels like a in the package everything else is great though
3	smells so good omg did n't expect that ! it is very light so great for summer super small hence the missing stars
4	i was surprised at the size of the tub this is a huge container unlike most creams on the market it has 10 oz in here this is good because it costs approx 100 it is a thick cream but not much is needed a small amount will melt on the skin unfortunately , this is not an overnight miracle so whether or not it actually will improve my \( very \) crepe y neck remains to be seen i have taken several photos and will compare them in a week , 2 weeks and a month i will also update the review how long it lasts somebody said the cream is greasy i do n't agree with that if a small amount is used i'm using it on my neck which is very dry perhaps the reviewers who report too much shine do n't have dry skin like me i do n't use this on the face since i have rosecea and very sensitive skin i only use it on the throat update october 9 , 2016 i 've stopped using it because it made my rosecea worse and i gave it to my mom who seems to like it she is 94 and convinced she has too many wrinkles she does n't but she likes it a lot and it seems to soften her skin good large size \( 10 oz \) ok aroma i did n't mind it thick cream which goes on smoothly and spreads well only a very small amount is needed contains natural ingredients not so good the only negative so far has been the name not very inviting ! who wants to admit you have crepe y skin \? not sure what else i would have called it but not that i realize that folks think it 's too expensive but my goodness , it 's 10 ounces ! ! look at the bottles at the department store counters and see how little is in them i do n't think this is overpriced but it might just be too expensive for many in spite of how much is in there
3	i love 99 of mario badescu 's products and while this was definitely very hydrating and gentle on my sensitive skin it felt a bit too heavy for daily or even regular overnight use that said , if you have a very dry eye area , this is an excellent product and great value given the quantity you receive
4	the vincent longo olive oil fix tip makeup remover wands do a very nice job in helping to clean up and fix makeup the olive oil itself works well the wands are a bit clunky this was a nice product to try out i do n't know that \( at the price \) i would go out and get another set hopefully that will come down a bit it is a nice size , boxed , for travel it definitely works , it 's pricey , but if that 's not an issue for the customer , then it is worth it
3	this lotion has only a very light medicinal fragrance and is easily absorbed by the skin the ingredients include arbutin , another name for hydroquinone , which reduces melanin production , plus alpha hydroxy acids to remove dead skin cells and give skin a fresh appearance it slightly improves the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles with regular use , but is not noticeably effective in reducing age spots or other areas of increased pigmentation a chemical peel can irritate the skin , especially with exposure to solar radiation , but this formula is fairly mild and contains skin conditioners , plus i have not spent much time in the mild winter sun , so i have had no problems using it i am surprised that this product is sold by amazon , because the obagi medical products website states that \( g \) obagi products are available only through physicians , medical spas , and other skin care professionals and obagi systems and products are physician dispensed and should be used only under the guidance of your skin care physician obviously , neither statement is true directions are to apply to affected area twice daily or as directed by a physician the small plastic bottle has a secure cap and holds 2 oz or 57 g comparison shopping with similar products would be advised to find the best value for the common ingredients of arbutin and mild alpha hydroxy acids ingredients water , arbutin , cetyl alcohol , glycerin , sodium lauryl sulfate , stearyl alcohol , tocopheryl acetate , ascorbic acid , , sodium , bht , lactic acid , disodium edta , butylparaben , methylparaben , propylparaben
4	my wife loves this gel like product this product feels light to the skin and non greasy and absorbs almost immediately after a couple of weeks of consistent use , my wife that this is such as super awesome product for her skin as she says that her fine lines are not visible anymore only complain is that the container pump side falls apart quite easily
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i use a lot of zoya nail polish and have recently become with yellow polish this i a color that i use a lot it 's like bottle of sunshine excellent , smooth formula 2 coats on this one perfection long wearing , chip free perfect another zoya winner !
5	i have been wearing this shade for years it 's terrific !
5	so far i really like this face exfoliator its made of silicone so its easy to clean with soap and water and you do n't have to worry about bacteria growing when not in use the charging port is completely sealed inside so you do n't have to worry about damage when washing or using in the shower when in use it you with pulses when to switch places and also when its time to start using the back side of the exfoliator for the anti aging routine so you cam complete the whole routine provided in their booklet without having to watch a clock it also turn itself off to prevent from over doing it with the exfoliation it takes the guess work out of exfoliating
5	really helps keep my nails looking and feeling great
1	product did not do as left hair limp and stiff
5	it seems as though this product is supposed to be for men , but i love it even though it sounds like something one would use to clean , this is far from what i found as a woman however i would caution that with one may want to use care around sensitive areas , but if you 're looking for the most refreshing , energizing , and calming shower experience of your life , get some ! someone called it morning coffee for the body i agree a sense of well being and i can do this comes over you almost instantly the fragrance is subtle and i would think generally pleasing , not medicinal at all , and leaves only a fresh clean smell after what was somewhat surprising was pain relief as i gently rubbed two sore arms can it get better \? yes , their lip balm is the best i 've ever tried at any price , and it 's spf 25 too ! and i just ordered the soothing balm i am so happy i discovered this , and am now a convert as always , amazon got it to me quickly and i 'll be back for more would make a wonderful gift for the person who has everything ! if they do n't have this they 're missing something great here 's an idea , get some for your significant other , and use it yourself a win win
5	the spray toner works very well for me i have very oily and sensitive skin , and the toner helps tame oiliness i have not experience any irritation from the use of the toner , too it has nice spraying pattern , not too wide to spray entire room , thankfully i was afraid it will spray too wide , but it did not happen it cools the skin and dries clean in a few minutes there are only three ingredients water , salt and zinc
5	i just used this polish for my manicure everyone loved it at the salon i am getting so many compliments ! this shade just might work all year long there is a beautiful shimmer to it as well a perfect mauve brown shade !
4	another product for men that i decided to try out i'm always looking for good hair stuff because my hair gets out of control in the summer with all the humidity this is a little bit but i find that if i just use the smallest amount on the ends of my hair , it is n't sticky and keeps my hair from getting frizzy and wild a little goes a long way so the price is pretty good i would recommend this , just do n't it
4	very pleasant smell , ck has done a good job with this scent ! i like floral fruity scents for my wife and this one hits the spot
2	i ordered this thinking it was going to be a good match to my complexion i have warmer skin with yellow tones and i have used honey beige true match foundation , which matches really well this honey beige is really dark and more peachy than honey it did not match well with my complexion at all it was also rather thin and did not cover very well i could n't really use it to see how long it lasted because my face looked horrendous with on \( as it was too dark \) so i cant comment on its staying power a plus was that it was fragrance free , as promised
2	i'm almost 60 years old , so i should n't have to worry about acne anymore unfortunately , a few hours after using this oil , my entire face in acne i tried it a few more times , just to make sure it was n't a fluke it was n't each time , i got more acne than the time before oh , this oil made my skin feel soft without an oily feeling , but i'm too old to have my face covered in acne i wo n't be using this anymore
3	this styling cream is okay but it caused my hair to flake which is n't okay
5	this is the best active sport sunscreen no sunscreen smell , stays put , give you the coverage you need and best of all no breakouts !
5	i read that rose oil is good for skin and i suffer from hives so though to add this to my daily rose oil routine because the oil itself is so expensive what i 've been doing is spraying this as a base to cover a larger area and saving the essential oil for specifically spots it seems to be working also smells nice and feels refreshing the price is very low for something that contains real rose oil i also spritz it on my hair in between washings
5	love the naked line of polish
5	i know its for men but i used it for my underarms and legs the cream is luxurious and rich gave me a very close shave which i like worth every penny
4	this was my first use of julep makeup i will say that i was happy to see that the color does apply lighter on the skin than it looked in the box \( i thought it was going to be dark \) i was a little disappointed to see that this compact comes with a mirror \( nice to have when you are away from your vanity \) but does n't come with a brush luckily , i have several makeup brushes that i keep when i apply at home which i used i will have to purchase a smaller brush to keep with me if i expect to take this in my purse when i go out this goes on smoothly , light and has a nice finish on my skin
5	love this color
2	i'm a huge essie fan and loved this color in the salon bought on amazon and it was goopy and not the quality i 've learned to expect something was off
5	i just received this cream and the first thing that struck me is the nice and elegant packaging it looks good just sitting on the bathroom counter , of course that is not what counts but the rest did n't disappoint either the cream is pink and very light , goes on smooth and leaves a wonderful floral scent that is just the right amount , not too subtle and not too overwhelming my skin felt really soft and it is great that the jar is big because you 'll want to put tho scream all over this cream is also non greasy so it absorbs well and you do n't have to worry about having to let it soak in before getting dress it is amazing after you shower , your skin will feel fabulous well , i have nothing negative to say about this cream , i recommend it and hope you indulge your skin and senses with it
4	toner is great for your skin its something i never really got into till someone purchased it as a gift for me , but it helps keep my pores small and my skin looking tighter and smooth is a generous amount , it will usually last me 3 4 months only using it in the mornings after showers when a breakout occurs the witch hazel in the toner helps them heal much faster i would recommend everyone use toner , once you try it , the difference is remarkable
3	i'm not really sure how i should rate this it smells weird , it feels like it 's doing nothing for me , and i ca n't it out how do i get my cleanser out of it \? just keep soaking it \? i hang it to dry like the instructions say and it gets super hard which takes a while to and moisten i just think the sponge is odd and weird i'm going to use it for at least a month to see if i notice anything different on my face i guess we will see i do n't feel any different after a week or so
4	so when this arrived i thought oh no ! there is no way this will match my skin because the bottle was much lighter and more pink however the product inside does n't look anything like the color of the bottle so you really need to sample this before buying i was super lucky in that this actually did match my skin i have been using it for about a month now and i really like it i normally wear a lancome liquid foundation and i have found that this one is a bit thicker and seems to stay on a bit longer my only other qualm with this makeup is that the way the bottle is designed a tiny squeeze and you have enough foundation for 3 days i wish they would rethink the bottle a bit i do like that it 's a squeeze bottle , however i wish the opening were a bit smaller so that i could get the exact amount i want out of it i would purchase this again
4	firstly , i am a loyal mario user other than clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel , mario products are the only thing that i put on my face this is a good day night cream for people with combination skin or for the drier winter months since my first pregnancy , my skin went from being more on the oily side to more on the dry side \( weird \) this works well , does n't break me out , and does n't have a very strong smell i alternate using this and the glycolic renewal complex and the chamomile night cream
5	love this series ! dries fast you ca n't tell that you have anything on your nails hides any yellow ! love it !
5	no scent \( yes ! \) goes on smoothly , though it does require some rubbing in to get rid of the white from the zinc but , since the zinc is what my doctor recommends , i'm glad it 's there i like it ! pleasant to use
4	although i prefer to use sunscreen only when im going to be , working in the yard or visiting a theme park , ive been using this for about a week for both moisturizing and sun blocking purposes all in all , it works well for both of those needs like many sunscreen lotions , theres a in this case , likely due to the sun blocking chemicals necessary to attain a given spf level once applied , the scent fades quickly the lotion is on the thick side , more like a skin cream
4	this is a very high end set of grooming equipment that would be suitable for a gift it comes beautifully packaged in a sturdy attractive box and a leather case the stainless steel tools are as beautiful as such things can possibly be the clippers are unique because they lay flat \( nice ! \) and have to be properly to cut these clippers are sharp and will work well for a gentleman 's fingernails they are probably too for his toenails , though , unless he is especially pampered which maybe he is if he 's buying , or being given , a set of ultra expensive nail clippers the scissors are especially well engineered they are comfortable and cut smoothly the file is a nice weight i doubt that these items work ten times better than a drugstore set that costs a of the price , but they are handsome and i expect them to last a very long time
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
3	i have not been impressed with drug store so i had high hopes for this salon glaze from oribe unfortunately , this one also disappointed me it 's a thin lotion consistency intended to add a glaze sheen to hair it does not add any conditioning to my hair with long , color treated hair , i am careful about what i use as part of my morning routine the oribe glaze adds an extra step without making any significant difference in how my hair looks it 's ok and i will use on occasion for special events it did add a slight sheen to my hair but not enough to justify the cost
5	a reorder for a friend that uses for a home business always pleased with it
5	strivectin multi action restorative cream i have been using this cream for about five weeks and am pleased with the results my skin feels softer and smoother i feel as i continue to use it , i will enjoy even more positive results i would give it 5 stars
5	i love the smell , it leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft !
5	love this stuff ! really deep cleans my face and it 's gentle for me cause my skin is sensitive a must buy !
3	this rub on tanning mousse works pretty well it is easy to use i would get one of the gloves as they help the application process out alot just rub into the are needing the tan and it works tan is a little darker than i thought but it works well will just pick a lighter color
5	this is a perfect powder goes on smooth and evenly compact has a mirror and under the powder is a separate compartment for the applicator i only needed a tiny amount and it provided the coverage i desired lovely product
5	love the color is just got it few days ago and it looks amazing
5	this is a fantastic hair dryer for a great price i have short , straight , thick hair in a reverse bob cut this blow dryer does not cause frizz and is powerful i love it i also use a flat iron after of course , amazon shipped this in two days
5	this shaving cream is so much better than foam and i find it hard to use anything else now that i 've used this it smells great , leaves my skin smooth and does n't leave a film behind it gives a close shave and i highly recommend it for a thicker hair
5	item exactly as described great quality fast ship
5	cnd is the best ! polish for sure ! i really like the fedora color , it has a maroon hue , but is very dark and almost borders a black color but with a look very flattering winter look
5	i have been using this for a few years , since having a facial person use it this eliminates dryness after washing face and leaves my skin feeling dewy i love the smell of bioelements , as well very clean
5	i'm not much of a bronzer user i 've tried several over the years with mixed results i 've never used the gold standard guerlain terra , because 50 is more than i'm willing to spend on something i 'll only use occasionally i have tried physicians formula , sephora sun disk and bliss spa since butter london is a fairly new cosmetics brand that 's been popping up in a lot of the better ladies , i was eager to give this one a try first off , the compact is much larger than i expected it measures about 4 5 inches long and 2 5 inches wide , so you get a lot of product for the money i did not try the contour shade , but used a combination of the bronzer and highlighter \( which is a warm frosty gold \) over my forehead , along my cheekbones , nose bridge and chin frankly , i'm amazed at what a lovely , natural looking glow it gave me not dirty looking , nor orange y in the least it really mimics the look of a light tan i was really my inner with this stuff the glow pen , a small tube that contains a golden liquid with a sponge applicator , looked more like a pale frosted yellow gold eyeshadow than anything i would use on my face , but at my age , that sort of tends toward the ridiculous i imagine a touch of that on the cheekbones or brow bone of a younger woman would look very glamorous this is , by far , the best bronzer i 've ever tried
5	nice color for summer essie polish lasts a good week and a half without chipping would recommend essie polish great deal
5	i really love this lotion ! it 's light and absorbs quickly , but does a great job moisturizing , and while i often get unscented products because i find the regular versions have odors that are too strong for my taste , this has a light , gardenia like fragrance that i adore i'm definitely going to try other products from this company
5	i can remove everything on my face with one cotton round a bit of this water the little cotton round is by the end at first i did n't use a cotton round i would put some of this in my hands and massage it onto my face i thought it would be a waste to put it on something that the something would absorb all the product rather , the waste was splashing this on my face it says you do n't have to wash it off your skin , and sometimes i do n't sometimes i just splash my face once or twice after with some warm water it 's a nice fast way to remove foundation , brow product , eye shadow mascara great when i'm tired before bed !
3	this moisturizing tint is not bad but there is no way it is worth 38 there is some moisturization and some tinting you get out of it but the results are nowhere near being impressive i do n't see any difference between this product and the alternative you can by at any pharmacy for 8 and for 38 , you can buy from a really respectable , fashionable brand if you have money to burn , go ahead but i would n't pay any if my own money for this product because i do n't see the point
5	as a super pale woman , i have a myriad of light colored foundations most are too yellow or too pink or turn orange on my skin after a couple of hours \( even with primer \) the best selection i 've found so far or pale skin is kat von d , but that foundation is heavy coverage that looks a bit too much for my daytime look i decided to try dermablend liquid camo in linen it is an almost perfect foundation for someone as pale as me it is almost exactly my skin tone , just a wee bit darker than still , it is closer than most any other foundations on the market it 's fine for every day , especially when i put a lighter powder dusting when dressing up , i 'll mix a bit of the kat von d with it and it 's perfect it does n't get cakey with my oily skin and lasts all day it 's buildable so you can get a heavier coverage when you want it goes on very smoothly and does n't feel heavy or greasy on my skin i absolutely love it and will be getting more when this tube runs out
5	i do n't know why essie stopped selling this in drugstores , but i absolutely love this color seller was prompt great great wedding nail color
5	great eye cream ! keeps eyes moisturized throughout the day and night !
5	love this pencil goes on like silk and stays put ! a must in my makeup arsenal
5	love this polish this is my second bottle and it is perfect it arrived very fast and has been worn several times on my fingers and toes
5	every great product has a wow moment the pixelated eye shadows surprised me by the beautiful sparkly results and easy soft application of the eye shadow there 's a bit of sparkle in the shadows , and it really works the colors are also great for my eyes blue on very pale white skin no freckles , but i get easily i buy lancome , so already know to invest in a good brand , but this was hands above my usual go to shadows one note it does not come with a brush it 's not a concern at all if you already own a good one but a good brush on it 's own will set you back 25 30 i also wear contacts during the day , and i was not bothered by the eye shadows or the sparkly pieces
5	outstanding product i am middle age and experienced significant sun damage as a young woman because i like the outdoors and did n't know how important sun protection for skin was at that time this product has made a significant difference in the health and appearance of my skin i was having great difficulties with sun spots , peeling , etc and generally my skin was aging quickly i 've seen a reversal in the appearance of those symptoms and i 've had people comment on how good my skin is looking these days this is n't a vanity thing for me , it 's a health and concern in any case , i strongly recommend this product !
5	very nice color !
5	i switch between this and the million dollar tanning mousse i love both
5	a new favorite awesome for sensitive skin i rotate mario badescu seaweed cleanser and lotion with mario badescu chamomile cleanser and lotion daily \( seaweed in the a m and chamomile in the p m \) and use mario badescu chamomile night cream this approach is so soothing for my middle aged skin that is prone to redness \( the redness has reduced dramatically \)
5	i get lots of compliments when i wear this shade very elegant for a night out , and i liked using it as a base , and applying a lighter brighter pink to my tips for a reverse french ombre effect
5	this review is for the strivectin multi action restorative cream , 1 7 oz this cream targets the 12 signs of aging fine lines , wrinkles , density , firmness , sagging , texture , dehydration , dullness , discoloration , clarity , and enlarged pores let 's face it all of us will deal with these issues at some point this cream offers protection against these effects the product says it is formulated with the pro 12 youth complex , resulting in a effect of protection this complex is built on nia 114 i had some trouble finding out just what nia 114 the strivectin website touts more benefits but finally explains nia 114 is a name for niacin vitamin b3 the magic is in how that niacin is delivered niacin works by stimulating repair of dna , enhancing energy and skin cell turnover , promoting the release of \( a natural repair hormone \) and stimulating a that decreases hyperpigmentation so does it work \? it does a great job of moisturizing , diminishing fine lines and wrinkles \( via a plumping mechanism \) , decreasing dullness and in my case , decreasing of pores i had no negative reactions to the product , such as redness , itching , peeling , etc i have had these reactions from retinol derived products sadly , almost all beauty products their capabilities and play on our to watching our bodies age but this products does a fairly good job of meeting at least some of its stated claims i would recommend it as well as other complimentary products in this line
3	vs cotz or \( similar silicone based , tinted , physical spf products \) , this one never sets and feels sticky all day
1	very disappointed it may be 7 free but it 's rated a 6 on ewg ugh ! i was going to go back to essie \( rated a 5 with ewg skin deep \) but will try zoya \( 5 free \) because of all the good things i read about it it was 1 of only 2 out of the 12 nail polishes tested that were really free of the toxic chemicals they claimed
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
4	this has a very red undertone and it transfers but i can still make it work , its ok
5	i was skeptical about this because it 's in powder form did n't expect sufficient coverage the name of the product is wow that is exactly what i said with the first brush stroke i was really surprised takes a while to get used to , but i think it works great not sure how long it will last , though nice brush and big mirror , too
3	i really n't decide how many stars to give this toilette spray , and between two and three i decided on three i know the scent of a perfume is very subjective , but i asked several people to try this on , and tell me what they thought , and the consensus was that it smells , not very good , and that they not buy this after smelling it that is pretty much my opinion , too it 's a nice bottle , very pretty , but i just did not like the scent
5	nice quick drying top coat
5	a cream color very pretty magenta purple pink not super bright just right would recommend for others to purchase for nice summer or all seasons color
5	works perfect for waterproof mascara i put some on my fingers and gently rub the mascara on my eyelashes with my fingers first to break it up since all waterproof is hard to remove i do n't want to tug once most of it 's off then i can just wipe the rest away it 's better than more expensive brands that i 've used but then all products in this line that i 've tried have been excellent !
5	i am partial to pink so of course i had to have this one i did a spin off of the french manicure with this as the base and hot pop pink as the tips and it was awesome ! must have for spring !
2	was not impressed but would probably be a good fit for someone with more sensitive skin i needed more than this
5	great color ! 3 coats makes it a r e a l l y dark almost black purple though i am partial to dark colors
4	a bit darker than i expected , but still beautiful ! i only recently discovered this line and have purchased the eye pencils after reading the reviews i recommend them too !
5	i 've tried a lot of facial creams , and this has to be one of my favorite the overall experience is luxurious and enjoyable , and it works fairly well although , there 's no such thing as a miracle skin cream the packaging is minimal and attractive the jar feels substantial , and the lid is n't fragile or difficult to open i 've had facial cream lids crack or break on me in the past , and there is no issue with that here i also dropped the jar on the sink by accident at one point , and it did n't chip or break the cream itself smells quite strong , a chemically floral smell if that was intentional , i think they could have it back a bit however , the scent dissipates after a few minutes and becomes unnoticeable the texture is fantastic that 's probably my favorite thing about this cream it 's almost like dipping your finger in butter in fact i was initially concerned that it would be greasy since it was so thick and luxurious it is not ! it vanishes into the skin within seconds and leaves my face nice and moisturized and ready for make up the other positive for me is that it works well on sensitive skin i often have the experience of burning or stinging when i moisturize , even with fairly nice product this does not hurt my skin in any way , even the thinner skin around my eyes in terms of the reduction of lines , i think they have something here i'm not sure it 's a lasting effect , but my skin soaks the moisture up so well that i 've actually noticed that the lines between my eyebrows decrease , and take longer to show this may just be that i'm hydrated , but hyaluronic acid is getting positive feedback from clinical trials , so i'm hopeful i think the only difficulty here is the price , which is fairly steep however , because of the wonderful spread and consistency of the cream , i doubt that it will need to be replenished that often maybe every few months
4	skin feels like new
5	liking this a lot have tried 2 other shampoos once from costco \( ca n't find it anymore \) , this one and one other on amazon i like this one the best suds up well i have long , straightened \( from very curly \) and it needs moisture this one is not drying i do still need a conditioner afterwards the davines cream jar conditioner is so so
3	i ordered one color and they sent me a different one luckily i liked the color they sent me but it just was n't the one i ordered it came on time thought
5	wow ! this is such a great find i have been searching for a concealer like this for years i have dark circles and veins under my eyes that are very hard to cover i usually have to use a ton of concealer to get the coverage needed the color is just perfect for dark circles and the consistency is n't thick at all it leaves a nice matte finish and does n't crease into fine lines i absolutely love this pen and will be buying more in the future i took and before and after photo and the after photo looks , except it 's not ! brilliant !
5	this is a nice moisturizer it 's really thick in the jar , but does n't feel thick on your skin it smells really nice , like honeysuckle , and i think the jar will last for a long time i 've been using it for five nights , and i notice that my skin feels softer and more supple i have n't noticed a difference in the mirror yet , but that may be because i 've only used it five nights it 's a 24 hour cream , so you only have to put it on at night and it keeps your skin moisturized until you put it on again the next night i do expect to see a difference in my face and neck if i keep using it , which i will do i'm very happy with this , because my skin feels so much softer and well hydrated
2	i'm in my early 30 's and have a receding hairline you ever sleep with hairspray on your hair and to wake up next morning with hair \? that 's exactly how i would describe the texture when you use this on your hair i purchased color black with the pump sprayer , pick comb , and their hairspray i accidently sprayed the toppik powder onto my scalp and noticed the toppik color was more like dark purple it takes a while to perfect the use of the pump to get the right amount of toppik sprayed only onto the hair no matter how perfect your results come out , up real close you can notice something different and i'm sure under the direct sunlight it 's probably 10x more noticeable toppik claims that people ca n't even notice 2 inches away , that 's this is definitely a better product than the scalp concealer toppik hairspray is like any other strong hold hairspray , absolutely nothing advanced or special about it the comb is a piece of crap , made out of cheap paper plastic not even worth a quarter ! go to a dollar store and find yourself a better comb toppik comes off easily so avoid moisture even your sweat , wind , and any objects elements disrupting the do the money and the time you have to spend to get a half decent look in my honest opinion is not worth it i rather deal with a wearing a hat then worrying about an embarrassing toppik malfunction maybe if you 're in your 60 's and not as concerned about the natural look then more power to you , but i still think people are over paying for a product that does n't promise what they claim i'm currently trying a product called nuhair i'm taking the vitamin and using their hair serum i'm only on the second month and hoping to see some results within the next few months there are no cheap quick fixes that lasts forever so i'm going to commit to this nuhair program for 5 6 months and hope for the best figure hair transplant takes up to 6 months anyways so might as well give the natural method a 6 month commitment if the natural way fails then rogaine is a possibility and then hair transplant bottom line , my girlfriend thinks i wasted my money on this product \( toppik \) and i'm going to have to agree with her on this hope you guys learn from my mistake if you guys know of any good hair transplant doctors in the bay area ca let me know good luck
3	i'm not a scent wearing person but i was into giving this a try i really liked the smell it had a nice non overpowering slightly citrus scent that did n't overpower anyone near me nor make me sneeze profusely as some cologne does however , the smell faded away in about an hour , which was disappointing supposedly the scent lingered for a while after that , but it was n't noticeable to me i do n't know if it 's watered down or it just fades away quickly , but it did n't last as long as i 'd like it was nice smelling , however , but i do n't want to myself in it so it lasts more than a few hours
3	i ca n't say i notice any difference when i use this i 've used it once in the morning for a couple of weeks and i'm still not sure what it does
5	this lipstick has become my new favorite go to ! ! ! the lucky color is a hint lighter than my own lip color but it 's absolutely perfect in color for me \( fair with blue eyes and blonde hair \) as i tend to favor the pinker neutrals in lipstick color the formula , for me , is excellent it 's minty and almost lip balm chapstick in feel and texture it goes on buttery smooth and lasts through lots of water drinking and chewing , which surprised me given how buttery it was i ca n't attest to the mood boosting but having a chapstick like lipstick in my life finally does make me a happy so maybe it does ! ha ! overall it 's a great lipstick ! wonderful formula , staying power , feeling and color !
4	good can be used on lids too , got at derm dr then found here
5	excellent cover cream that is easy to apply and works great it blends in with your skin and looks very natural
5	i regularly wear dermablend foundation and concealer , so i was excited to try out their quick fix body foundation i tried it on my face as a normal foundation stick and also to cover some surgical scars for testing purposes i do not have tattoos so i ca n't comment on coverage of them i tested the makeup with three different blending methods my finger , a beauty blender , and a foundation brush the foundation brush provided the thickest single coat coverage , but i preferred the slightly smoother look of the blender \( though it required more product \) it was easy to apply with all three of the methods pros creamy , full coverage makeup without feeling caked on or thick coverage is very buildable just let it sit for a few minutes between coats and blend ! facial acne , undereye circles , and surgical scars completely disappeared using this product long , long , long lasting ! if applied correctly \( with setting powder \) , you will not need to touch up at all it also held out during a particularly nasty rainy day though it is long lasting , i did n't have to scrub hard to get it off at the end of the day it was easily removed with makeup removing cloths did n't clog my pores full coverage foundation this acne prone girl , so it 's always exciting when a product is actually about its status cons i had none !
5	another great product from la roche posay i 've been using la roche products for awhile , mostly the sunscreens , and i have n't hit a dud once this is a great brand of skin care i'm absolutely horrible about washing my face before i go to bed , so i'm always looking for products that are quick and easy this is one of the better ones i 've tried it 's got the texture of toner , but feels better this got off all my make up , and did not sting my eyes or leave my skin feeling irritated , as most toners do and even thought i did n't rinse it off , my skin actually felt clean
5	i was searching for a very rich purple not too dark but a rich bold purple i definitely found it with this color luv it ! ! !
5	this is the best it was first recommended by my dermatologist , and i use with the clarisonic my skin has been clear ever since well worth the money ! it 's the one product i'm loyal to ! !
3	not quite as bright aqua as expected and shown but still a great color !
5	i love love love the way this smells and use it every single day my skin is softer and smooth i will definitely recommend
5	so happy i purchased this ! smells so good ! its the real thing
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i have been using this product for many years although it is expensive , it is the only toothpaste i use
2	over the years i 've used all kinds of shaving creams and foams and recently tried out baxter of california super close shave formula years ago i switched from using gillette products including foaming shave gels to a razor system including a badger hair brush and a shaving cream called proraso i 've been happily using proraso for years but the only to that product is that it is expensive after using baxter 's super close shave formula for a week my conclusion is that this product is simply not for me the single biggest issue here is that this cream does not form a nice , rich lather for my shaves or much of any lather at all even using my baxter branded badger hair brush this cream does not form any kind of lather in order to get a decent shave i ended up having to use a tremendous amount of the shave cream with proraso a small , dime sized dollop will lather up into a thick lather so while this may be marketed as a premium product , after using this cream i'm left to conclude that that 's exactly what it is marketing instead of substance additionally this cream has a rather unpleasant medicated odor not recommended
2	the color itself is great the polish is clumpy so much glitter that its almost pasty i 've decided to but a nail polish thinner to see if that helps and if it does i will update but at this point i ca n't use it for the money i expected higher quality
3	i ordered pixie dust its an ok polish but for what i have gotten with zoya before i was a bit disappointed the polish is very see through , think top coat with glitter in it it would take several coats before you could n't see through it im also not a fan of how it dries like sandpaper on your nails you need a top coat with this unless you want your nails to snag every fuzz or hair it is pretty but i wanted something that went on smooth with some sparkle so i could have a silver glitter accent nail this was n't it \(
5	really nice amount of moisture without being greasy my boyfriend loves it
3	after a month or so of use in this household im still not positioned to offer an informed and confident opinion on the effectiveness of this product well , i am however the other member of the household who was also using it holds a view of course , shes also been convinced other magical have shown some benefits even though it doesnt appear to me she was so enamored with most of them that she was willing to continue to pay the i am not with a face that could be mistaken for a well worn , dog so my expectations of this supposed skin strengthening complex were modest to start with i do like how quickly it is absorbed , the relatively small amount required to treat target areas and the absence of any annoying fragrance at the same time , on those rare occasions where i do find something smile worthy , the early of a crows feet trail are still there and getting more discernible all the time if you 're interested in the other persons opinion , she needs to get her own reviewing account
4	a very pretty color , although maybe a little too metallic for me i take this to my manicurist for her to use on my nails
5	the perfect every day color goes with everything i use this as my in between color when my nails are short but i want color and strength
4	love essie but i am not thrilled about this color but too each his own
5	this goes on light and lasts me all day i work an 8 12 hour shifts and have n't had any problems so far !
3	skyn iceland under eye illuminator , this seems to brighten up the eye area after using it for awhile i have noticed that under my eyes do not seem as puffy i like the metal applicator makes it really cool when you put it on you do not need to use much at all just a tiny dab works fine i have not noticed that it helped dark circles i had from not enough sleep one week overall it is ok and does seem to firm the area up after longer term use
5	feels great , smells great , reduced after she issues \( itchy , redness , ingrown hairs \)
5	love this stuff ! ! ! i alternate between this facial spray and my evian spray wish i started using these sooner !
4	my first concern when trying any new product is whether or not it will make me break out i am happy to report that it has not this is a very light lotion , but it does n't take much to cover my face it moisturizers well but i do use another lotion on top at night i think my skin looks brighter but it is too soon to tell how well this will work as to fading spots and evening out skin tone , it takes several weeks to make a noticeable change this can be worn under makeup also , when you first take the top off , use a pin to poke a hole in the tube and squeeze lightly or too much will come out at once
5	after almost a week of use \( and knowledge that i am with my five star reviews \) i have nothing but good things to say about this and firming cream its thicker , firm bodied and one can literally feel it working and the best thing about it \( in my opinion \) is it stays on all day it also seems to create a great barrier between the skin and makeup , therefore im no longer using primer and my makeup both applies in a more even manner and last longer i received a small sample size \( think beauty counter sample \) and plan on purchasing a full size i was surprised to discover i prefer it to my long standing used hope in jar \( also , no breakouts , at least for me \)
5	it 's not as bright as the picture it 's like a neon grass green in reality and i ca n't get enough of it ! it 's such a unique color a must buy for the polish obsessed !
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	this body lotion is great and i'm pretty ecstatic to discover it now it is so light and not too sweet scent is incredibly clean i love the way my skin feels after i put it on something is just so good about it i love another certain lotion with oatmeal it 's actually my favorite around the house and made by aveeno i feel this one made with wheat is very similar in the way it feels the difference is price , with aveeno you get a lot more for a lot less
4	my daughter is prone to pretty decent breakouts and is constantly fighting with her complexion juice beauty clearing serum seems to work pretty quickly and has cleared up her skin in a week or so , after some blemishes were brought to the surface in a little less than a week of use , she is seeing some great results my other daughter who only has infrequent acne has had good results on blemishes with this product they also use benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with this product one product brings the acne to the surface from under the skin and the other it in a pretty powerful combo the only downside to this product is that it leaves my daughter 's \( the one more prone to breakouts \) skin feeling like the serum is kind of greasy or stays on her skin this has ingredients to help skin from becoming too dry which is a of a lot of acne creams all in all , this is an effective treatment for bad break outs and to clear up minor blemishes quickly it does n't dry skin out but can leave a film i think my younger daughter is quite happy though her skin feels a little greasy she still likes the fact that this works pretty quickly over time , i think her face will be clear from using this product good stuff for blemishes and break outs
5	good
3	whatever it 's supposed to calm , it does n't because i still am just as off whenever faux news comes on even makes my skin turn bright red this makes zero difference why is that \? because it does n't cure skin conditions anymore than it can fix on the tv it 's just a cream in a tube nonsense about herbs that 's mostly blah blah feel good nonsense you have eczema \? dermatitis \? rosacea \? good heavens , get to a dermatologist no matter how good a tube of over the counter smell good is it wo n't fix a medical condition it 'll just fix your wallet out of money but it does smell nice and it actually does moisturize nicely but i'm still mad at the news
5	another great product from oribe , i am very happy they offer this in a travel size before deciding if i should purchase the full size this masque definitely rates a 5 star for smoother more manageable hair i found after leaving this in for half an hr my hair was shiny and my frizz was dramatically reduced i also went longer in between coloring my hair than very impressive stuff
3	i prefer the clarisonic the clarisonic is a sonic cleansing brush , which is supposed to send out sonic vibrations to clean your pores more deeply the brush is too soft and the bristles are too long whereas the clarisonic has a stiffer and shorter brush the bristles on the lumarx are way too soft to really do much and because of their length will sometimes the suds the clarisonic comes with its own cleanser which i really like and really helped my skin to feel clean and glowy a little goes a long way also lumarx doesnt include any cleansers in the package the lumarx is smaller than the clarisonic which makes it easier to move between the nose and top lip and around the bridge of the nose between the eyes the lumarx stands upright and the light turns off when charged , which i liked the clarisonic lays flat , which i do n't like , and the light doesnt go off unless you it from the charger although i like a few of the features better than the clarisonic , i feel the clarisonic is a deep facial cleanser whereas the lumarx is more of a superficial one
3	there is no evidence to me that this product is an improvement over many others that are similarly priced or less
4	this is a pretty good setting powder it comes in a generous sized compact , and includes a puff to apply i do n't use the application puff , as i find my existing makeup wears off on it i use a large , fluffy powder brush instead the color i have is translucent , but i find that it is more white than truly translucent when i brush it on it leaves a definite white cast on my face , and i'm pretty pale the directions for this powder say to use it for baking basically , put quite a bit on , leave it for a few minutes , and then brush off i really want my powder to be able to perform for regular wear too i like a thin layer brushed on top to finish the look for this reason , while this is nice enough powder , i would not go out of my way to repurchase , as i would look for something with less white cast
5	i had been using the proraso menthol shaving cream for years and love it but switched over to jack black beard lube for a change and did n't like it \( and it it twice as much as the proraso \) when i saw the proraso sandalwood option i thought i would try it , so back to the proraso line the sandalwood is the same as the menthol product in terms of generating lather i use it with a panasonic wet shaver and man , the lather it creates is voluminous as long as there is some water applied via the shaver head the lather never dries or dissipates it can lead to a mess but if you want plenty of lather this is the way to go i do n't agree with other reviewers who say the scent is too strong or bothersome both the menthol and the sandalwood imo are pleasant and definitely not overpowering a great product , highly recommended
5	i'm usually not a huge fan of pink polish , but this one is really pretty very pale , chalky pink the spring line seems pretty thin , but i got good coverage with 2 coats also tried with a layer of as a final coat before top coat and was very pretty
5	i love the color only needs 2 coats
5	beautiful lavender colour
4	lovely , fruity scent the description says sweet orange and cedar wood but i would say the orange is definitely stronger it only takes a single spray to give you that lovely scent i like using it on my damp hair the scent will linger for quite some time after my hair dries it also makes a good body spray
3	let me begin by telling you that i am a long time lancme user stand alone , the nuface anti aging infusion serum trio are difficult to fully evaluate they are meant to use with the nuface trinity facial trainer \( 300 \) , which i do n't own and they did n't send , so my review will be on the serum only the three small bottles of serum bottles arrive to you neatly packaged i have attached some pictures for your review for each application , you use approximately 4 drops i used the drops alone , to test the basics fragrance was n't an issue and after using for a week , i experienced no breakouts the smoother was actually neat your skin looks and feels hydrated at the price point , i ca n't get excited over it though perhaps with the facial trainer , the serum would give more miraculous results \?
5	my face is way too sensitive it loves to make my life miserable with its acne parties most cleansers \( esp foaming \) dry me out and lead to more acne this smells so fresh and is fairly gentle \( for me \) cleans my oily skin well , mildly chemically exfoliating once in a while i 'll just leave it on my face for 20 min before rinsing for the first time in years my skin is clear and glowing thanks to this product as well as others from mb i like the toners , rose oil , rose spray do n't like the mb stuff specifically formulated for acne \( not just mb i think all acne products are too aggravating \) would rather use essentials oils for that \( lavender oil kicks my cystic hormonal pimples ! \)
3	i'm not sure how to do this review because i only received 3 products in hair on the go package , and only 1 is one of the items in the picture that 's why i gave it 3 stars i do n't know if this was a mistake in shipping or they did not link me to the correct product when i click to do the review the above package with 4 items is what shows up i would give these products more stars because all three of the products that i did receive do a good job on my hair however , i do n't want anyone to have a problem with products i have not reviewed i did some research on amazon and found out i received the phyto mix and match hair trio , so that is what i am reviewing my hair has been really dry lately these products make my hair more manageable and less fly away , especially the that is pictured with the set on this i switch off between the 3 products , so i use a hair mask twice a week two of the products have the look and consistency of soft bubble gum the pump container has a thinner consistency like conditioner all spread easily into my hair i leave on my hair while im taking a shower and then rinse out im going to be buying more of the trio once i run out its cheaper to get a phyto set than to buy a full container of one item so i recommend doing that , if you want to determine which product will do the best on your hair i give the trio i received 5 stars
3	this is a lighter lotion , but it seems to do the trick pretty well does n't clog your back up and all that i'm not crazy about the smell though , it smells like sunblock i'm assuming that 's the shea butter , but its not my favorite lotion smell
5	pretty color almost like a grey and cream color i will buy this again as my go to neutral color
5	love these hot roller i wanted some for traveling and these will do the job the whole thing is nice and compact while the hot rollers are nice and get hot quick i love the fact that it comes with both butterfly and metal clips i love the metal clips and they fit inside the rollers which again is perfect for traveling i use protective gloves to use hot rollers and that really helps since they do get pretty hot i love , love these very glad i purchased them
4	what options do we have when going bald \? this a good product it does not attaches to the hair as they promise but it really helps to cover bald spots
1	it 's a jelly formula which means it takes 6 coats or so to be opaque i'm super disappointed ! ! ! ! i was so excited only to be extremely let down awful formula , do not buy even over white it just looked ugly and messy
4	i have not seen any signs of healthier hair since i started taking these vitamins and using the phyto scalp treatment and shampoo i'm sure the vitamins are good for you , but the claims to grow hair are somewhat
2	maybe missing something \? \? i thought i would splurge and get a great dryer for shiny hair and faster drying its not any better than my old clogged up cheapie dryer and it doesnt get very hot what am i missing \? \?
1	i 've used lots of glycolic pads , even stronger than these , and yet these are the only ones that burn my skin i could tolerate it if they worked
4	this is my fourth bottle it seems to make the skin smoother , softens wrinkles
3	i like it ok but will go back to my pressed powder
4	i love mario badescu 's product they never brake me out with a rash or brake me out considering i have very sensitive dry skin i like this very much but i'm a little older and wanting a bitter stronger of a product so i'm moving on to the honey , but this would be great for anyone under 40
5	this is an excellent variety pack of brush heads i had always thought that the sensitive skin brush was soft trying the cashmere made me realize i was dead wrong this set is perfect if you have multiple clarisonic users in one house as it has something for everyone also good if you use a different head for different body parts
5	this is a great light almost nude color i received this polish very quickly great fall color love essie polish
4	shaving cream and razor blades seem to be a subjective experience the proraso is good quality for the price , squeezes out of the tube in a nice thick bead , and lathers up well with the brush by the time i got to the end of the shave , the cream in the last areas had dried up somewhat , and did n't provide the same amount of glide the metallic tube , like old school toothpaste , got rather up in shipping , and i had a similar italian brand in my travel kit recently plastic tubes ship and fly better
4	some of my nails peel , some do n't in the past 3 years , i wore impress nails which i loved i 've been using do it yourself led \( light \) nail polish which i also love the problem is , i tend to pull the impress nails off pick at the led polish instead of removing it properly both these bad habits made my peeling nails worse i 've been having trouble strengthening them again through the years , i 've used a few different nail i have a couple favorite brands that when used according to directions they protect harden my nails enough that my nails grow out again their \( my nails \) nature is to peel , so eventually they 'll begin peeling no matter how healthy they are i also found a filler polish which helps even out the ridges caused by peeling layers i 've been testing julep take a oxygen nail treatment for about two weeks now it seems to act as a filler a nail hardener it is a milky pink color which when applied looks more sheer it seems to hide imperfections pretty good my peeled layers look much nicer smoother it also hardens my nail \( i test this by trying to bend my nails that have peeled are thinner on the edges \) i 've been applying two coats , then wait a few days and apply another i 've found that i do n't like the looks of the polish when i use 4 or more coats for me to have the polish look presentable , i should remove the polish on about day 5 start over this polish does seem to chip easier than some polishes according to instructions , it works best if used alone so i have n't applied additional color on top of it it is a sheer pink which looks milky pink but when applied it is sheer surprisingly helps hide smooth my peeled layers the polish becomes more opaque when 4 or more coats have been applied however , i do n't like the looks of the polish if i use more than 3 coats the container looks like it would easily tip over , but its weight helps keep it upright even at that i am more cautious when using it , especially when i remove excess polish from the brush i'm now at the two week mark of using this polish continually , as instructed , and it seems to be working i like the way it helps hide cover fill in the layers caused by my peeling nails it does n't completely hide them , but definitely improves their appearance
3	years ago my cologne of choice was a calvin klein creation called ck one that scent was light clean and citrusy , the type that i still prefer though my current go to choices have been issey and by and \( mentioned to a of personal preference \) those both qualify for the suggested correct strength of a scent also , of being barely detectable until someone has into your personal space i was anxious to see what the people at klein had released with this new reveal love the container which has clean lines and suggests something simple but elegant inside the first spray revealed a scent that had strong overtones , at least to my nose , of vanilla beans and a hint of almonds both very pleasant it takes a few minutes for any scent to mix with your individual body chemistry and skin oils and any initial alcohol to evaporate before it settles down to it 's real character allowing that time left still very strong scent of vanilla and perhaps talcum powder , but very , very sweet almost overpoweringly so in fact it caused me to react by repeated sneezing something i 've never experienced with any product before you want a scent to linger so it lasts throughout your day , but this scent was so strong i found myself with a headache and actually needed to wash it off ! imagining , perhaps , something else in the environment had caused the reaction , i applied it again the next day , but the reaction was the same the scent was so overpowering that i felt the need to apologize to anyone near me , and hoped i was n't giving off the impression of those people we all know who seem to take a bath in their perfume or cologne \( my elderly third grade teacher comes to mind , though was after my parents explained that elderly folks sometimes have their sense of smell diminished so put on amounts of a scent until they can detect it ! \) to be clear , i like the scent and tones , but if the volume could be back considerably i even tried spraying it on my fingers to just then dab a bit on my neck , but it still has boom box volume sorry calvin , you still have all my and blue jean dollars , but until the scent is toned down in another , i ca n't use reveal i suggest , as with any scent , a person test it at your department store of choice or at a duty free shop between flights to see if the scent and powerful strength is to your liking as with all things , scent and strength are relative to our individual taste and perception but the screaming volume and cotton candy sweetness that lingers unfortunately make it unusable for me
2	2 coats and a topcoat and still it chipped thought at this price it would be better quality polish but no !
4	i got this for my wife to try out , and she said it is an excellent foundation easy to use , covers well , and lasts long it covers up blemishes and light discoloration the only issue is that getting a skin color match the coloring is strong , so you have to make sure it will match your tone
4	i am not a fan of cilantro in food but i had a coupon for 30 off \( local retailer \) so i purchased this with the peppermint shampoo and a few other products this is a very nice , light conditioner that actually seems to disappear into the hair before i rinse it out i really think this has a nice fragrance but it 's not really too representative of cilantro i notice the smell occasionally during the day , have not seen any product buildup and would definitely recommend this to people who like quality product \( product w 's \) if you do n't normally spend money on \( non drugstore \) product , i 'd say that there are better products out there to try when splurging
3	great nailpolish but i thought it was going to be more lavender its more gray than anything but still a pretty shade
5	i have used this drying lotion before and i really like it if i catch a blemish early , it dries it up overnight also , it i used it on mosquito bites and it took care of them i have really sensitive skin and cannot use a lot of products , however , have not had a problem with mario badescu drying lotion i , also , bought a bottle for a friend
5	yes , it is expensive , and no , it does n't give you huge voluminous lashes but i was n't looking for a mascara that would give me big lashes , i was looking for a mascara that did n't smear all over and did n't crumble into my eyes get stuck on my contact lenses i have tried numerous brands clinique , revlon , loreal , , paula 's choice all have either melted smeared or by the end of the day i do have really oily lids , which is part of the problem once blinc dries , it stays put it does n't crumble it does n't smear it does n't flake off into my lenses causing me to run out of meetings so i can wash chunks of mascara out of my eyes sure , it is n't an amazing mascara in terms of producing volume or length , bit it does help darken and define i wo n't use anything else now the only downside is if you get any water on the mascara before it dries , it out and creates a massive mess make sure your lashes are super dry when you apply
5	i love this shade cannot be without it
4	fast shipping , product just as described
2	i 've been pleased with dermablend products all in all , but for some reason i found this one looks un natural it gave my skin a mask like look it just did n't suit me at all i'm not sure if it 's just a reaction with my own skin chemistry or if other people also find this product looking very artificial after application again , i am usually satisfied with dermablend makeup , this was my one exception
5	saw this nail polish color on pinterest and i searched the stores trying to find it and then i saw it on here and i was a little skeptical buying nail polish online but it came brand new and the color is a dead match !
4	i 've got very dry skin , this helps a lot
5	excellent non greasy hydration light weight , lightly fragranced , heavy for minimizing dryness reminiscent of skin lotion my nurse aunt regularly used i enjoyed using it as a kid and love this ahava as an aging adult , especially on my hands after frequent washing especially as it gets cold here in colorado
5	salicylic face wash works very well for me and i had heard wonderful things about obagi chemical peels so i was excited to try this i was a little nervous it would be drying , but it 's not it does a pretty good job of cleaning makeup off my face i 've only had trace amounts of makeup left after washing you only need to use a little bit so this bottle is going to last a really long time if you like the feel and smell of menthol you will love this
3	the obagi360 hydrafactor broad spectrum is a nice combination moisturizer sunscreen offering spf 30 protection this is my first time using a obagi360 product , at the current time of writing this review , it is priced higher than i normally pay for purchasing facial sunscreen moisturizers both separately it is a thick cream that comes in a plastic container with a pump top i use a lip saver moisturizer \( brand starts with an a \) it offers spf protection has similar ingredients as this product does i like that this does not have a smell to it it 's very faint , and not at all like a typical sunscreen scent the reason i rated it 3 stars is for 2 reasons 1 \) i received it in early february , it has a 4 17 expiration date so , if you purchase , it 's something you should be aware of typically , items i 've bought online will give me a little longer to use them , so while i'm sure this could probably be used for a period of time after the expiration , it 's worth noting the expiration for the one you receive may be longer \? i 'd recommend opening it right away after ordering to check the date 2 \) the cost current price at time i'm writing this review is 56 , which has to be the most costly moisturizer and or sunscreen i 've ever owned it 's nice however that 's not a cost i 'd be willing to pay for future purchases an extended expiration , a lower cost would have given this a 5 star rating from me hope you found this helpful happy shopping ! \)
5	one of the most frustrating aspects of purchasing makeup online is to figure out the best color for yourself in mac i wear pressed powder so i took a chance with this dermablend color when i opened the jar i was so disappointed because it looked way too dark and red for my color i decided to try it on my skin anyway it turned out that this is the perfect color for me around my chin area i have dark marks and this dermablend did an excellent job covering it up \( see photos \) it took just the tiniest little bit to great complete coverage after applying with the included spatula , i blended with my finger tip and then set it with a little loose powder with the little that i used and with the size of this jar , i can see this stuff lasting at least a year i am super pleased with this makeup and super happy i picked the right color the first time around the photos i 've included with the makeup are before i put a setting powder it 's just the dermablend blended with my fingertip one of the pictures has a shadow from my phone , but i think you can still see the difference
4	overall not bad but stings my skin a bit
5	i put this on my face before i go out is good for winter and summer thank you ,
1	i just used this product for couple days and right now area around eyes swelling , burning and red , some ingredient in the that cream i am allergic too and i been used before other companies but never have like this allergic reaction ever
5	im beauty product skin care skeptic ive fallen for so many false promises over the years , that its with mixed feelings that i confess the elemis pro collagen skin care system works ! ive tried it out several times by using it on only one side of my face , and i really can see the improvement in my case , the deep wrinkles are a bit less obvious and deep so it seems that those of you will smaller \( younger \) wrinkles will see even more improvement i use it both on days when i go makeup free and on those days that wear foundation and it works both ways i like it i do n't think that it erases wrinkles they 're still there but for several hours they 're less obvious i just wish that it were a less expensive option because i doubt that i can walk away
5	cnd is one of the best brand of gel shellac that i have used it will cure using an led light or a uv light i have used both i have tried some of the less expensive brands , but they have caused nail damage , especially the ones that claim not to need a base coat as long as i soak off the cnd gel thoroughly with pure acetone , there have been no issues do not scrape off let the acetone do the work make sure all layers are removed if your nail looks shiny , the base coat has not been completely removed then soak longer when applying the gel , be sure to apply one coat of the base , 2 coats of shellac , one top coat , and cure according to the directions between each coat be sure to seal the edges of each coat or you may get water between the coats and your nail , which may result in a nail fungus if applied properly , it will last 2 weeks i would not advise keeping it on longer than this due to the breakdown of the shellac , and nail exposure to water love this brand well worth the money
2	i am using the same review as i did for the conditioner because i am not sure which product contributed to the end result i heard so much about this product that i wanted to try it it did n't work well for my hair type , which is naturally soft and hard to style it left my hair soft but really too soft i found it was difficult to style no matter how many styling products i used i ended up giving it away after a few uses it might work for someone who is looking to wear their hair in a straight style or someone that has course hair
4	i have n't used eyeliner in awhile just out of pure laziness , but when i saw this i figured it 's time to revisit jillian dempsey is known as being a really great makeup artist , so i was curious what she could do creating her own line i loved that one end was eyeliner and the other was a smudger i got the rich brown and it worked perfectly for me it is indeed a rich brown warm and it was easy to smudge and manipulate which i appreciated no tugging and smooth application i 'd try this in black as well really nice eyeliner
4	the toner over the last 6 weeks has made my skin brighter and more clear the only thing i do n't care for is the smell it smells of licorice
5	i have been using smooth \( unscented \) as a hand and foot lotion for the ten years i 've been in and out of i tried the hydro salve hand cream and was very pleasantly surprised at how well it compares first , it is unscented ! that is so important when changes in chemo often means changes in senses of smell taste next , it is quite thick and it absorbs and hydrates very well
5	love this product i am just starting to switch to the image line of facial products so far i am enjoying all of them and a nice price point
4	i 've been wearing calvin klein 's obsession for many years i usually wear obsession but have tried eternity and euphoria and liked those as well i 've only used the obsession body lotion , which i received in a gift set , so i was curious to see if i would like the eternity now lotion as much the lotion goes on smoothly and gives a light scent that lasts a surprising amount of time i can see wearing this to work without irritating coworkers with an overwhelming scent if you are using this because of dry skin , you might need to use something specifically for dry skin this is more to make your skin feel silky and smooth while giving off a pleasant scent for instance , the bottom of my feet are very rough , this is not something i would expect to fix that the biggest drawback is the price \( currently 43 00 \) i did n't like it anywhere near enough to pay so much over a less expensive scented body lotion
5	this is my first time using a setting product i really like how this works it seems to make my face look , not greasy and does seem to keep my face looking better throughout the day just do n't spray too much , i noticed that if i used too much product my face started looking pasty this small bottle has lasted a very long time , and i will definitely purchase more
4	this does what is says it will do for the most part i applied it and noticed when i started putting polish over it that it was n't fully dry yet not sure how long you have to wait but it 's longer than most base coats it almost has a more glue like texture so just wait a lot longer than you expect i think since i applied too soon , some bits of the base coat did n't stay put so there were a few spots where peeling it off was harder but i bet if i gave it more time , it would work perfectly also , if you are a bit rough on your nails \( washing dishes , swimming , anything with your hands really \) , the polish might start to peel off on its own ! that 's generally not a big deal since i'm usually over glitter polish after a few days but just a warning on that one mine did start to come off of a few of my nails before i was ready to remove it
4	essie is by far my favorite nail polish ! i needed a good green color while yes , i do like this color , it is not as thick as i would like
5	vichy 's micellar oil reminds me of a product i used to adore , 's oil cleanser unlike that cleanser , this is a one part only not requiring any mixing of 2 products the cleansing power of micellar oil is superb , it attracts oily grime and makeup and gives my pores a lovely deep cleansing i was concerned that my skin would feel too clean , but that 's not the case at all yet my skin is every bit as clean as it would be with a lathering cleanser only my face does n't feel tight and dry i got the best results with 2 cleanses with this oil i get super dirty at work , and one cleanse just is n't enough ! this product is awesome for removing eye makeup as well it takes a bit of getting used to using a product like this if you 've been using lathering cleanser those who use creamy cleansers will adapt much easier if the skin still feels oily after using , you have n't rinsed enough ! try it in the shower , and you 'll see the difference i also recommend using a cleansing brush with this product \( either manual or battery operated like a clairsonic \) , this really helps clean pores in the t zone where blackheads can accumulate vichy offers several different versions of this product for all different types of skin types oily , combination , and this one for normal to dry this version is intended for dry skin , and should n't be used by younger oilier complexions i plan to continue using the vichy micellar oil from now on , i 've been converted ! i'm looking forward to using this as the weather changes to winter , and my skin gets extremely parched by indoor heat highly recommended !
5	beautiful light blue color ! !
5	love this soap ! ! i used to buy it at the mall , but now i'm and do n't go any longer the scent is captivating and the lather is luxurious i do n't even need lotion afterward , unlike other soaps and gels i 've used , that leave my skin feeling dried out \( even 's \) and my bathroom smells like an expensive spa now
5	beautiful color for the summer !
5	i like the dark sparkly midnight blue color !
5	this is a pretty candle with a lovely fragrance it is perfect for making a warm cozy and the mood of a room
2	smells pine and synthetic house of burberry has this accord that gives me a headache of i smell too long ill save for christmas time and try on a cold day evening
5	this jimmy choo parfum spray smells amazing ! very feminine and light !
5	love these cute bunny glosses ! the color pay off is nice and the tubes are super cute ! i also love the way they smell !
5	this is a great product to cover blemishes , under eye circles , redness , age spots , etc if you get sun like i do it is a great product to prevent burning it is pretty much impervious to the sun i love it
1	this is a genuine piece of junk the instructions are impossible to follow looking up the web site and trying to understand the usage is a task , my recycle bin accepted this with open arms
3	this curling iron comes with a high price tag but it does n't allow me to change the temperature of the heat without this feature , it 's easy to burn your hair if you 're not careful accordingly , the manufacturer included gloves with the iron to prevent you from hurting yourself but i 'd rather have a temperature control instead
5	i 've used a variety of grooming products , and all work well and smell great this is no exception my beard quickly took in the oil , and it immediately felt great smelled great too before even asking my wife for an opinion , she about how much softer if was
3	i'm disappointed with this curling iron after all the amazing reviews my hair is waist long and baby fine , and i had hoped that i could create that wand look with this and the high heat would keep the curl longer , but instead , i can only do the old school clamp and curl way , and it does n't last long at all , even with hair spray i'm going to keep trying because maybe i'm just not used to it yet , but overall i am not wowed like every other reviewer
4	always looking for the perfect grey this is grayish with a purple undertone great everyday color that wears like iron
5	the baxter of california hard water pomade works quite well it 's easy to apply evenly and holds well i 've only been using this for a few days , but i love it so far it gives a natural looking finish , but holds the hair pretty well given the cold weather we 've been having this winter , i 've been wearing winter hats on a daily basis , and it 's easy to get everything out and looking good again so , this pomade seems pretty resilient it goes on easy and cleans off easily as well overall , this seems like a very good product
5	we ca n't go wrong with ellie can we \? i love this and so will you
4	its a good thing all brushes fit on the smart clarisonic , i thought this was the kind with the chip not it works anyway , i 'll be more careful next time when ordering ! ! !
5	nice vibrant color ! a beautfully deep blue i love the quality of essie and how long it lasts worth ever penny ! !
2	looks yellow on my nails i do love other zoya except this
4	depending what you want out of this product if you are really concerned about aluminum in anti , this is for you if not really that big on going no aluminum , maybe not i am a heavy sweat er and this works okay for me around the house , but if i go outside and really sweat , it 's not so good , i sweat heavily and this does n't cover it up it 's sort of old style as it goes on damp and you wait for it to dry before you put on clothes for an alternative to antiperspirant , it 's not too bad , but i would n't use it for work or anything
4	all of the jouer products that i have tried have offered a soft , natural finish most days , this suits my personal style i really enjoyed this petal blossom color it natural and fresh the formula did not irritate my sensitive skin also , i very much love this streamlined packaging , and how it with other jouer colors to create personalized this compact contains a lot of product , in tight package , with a quality mirror , with no wasted space there is no brush , which i do n't mind at all i'm going to use my own brushes , and the brushes that come free with product are rarely worth having , so the no brush is the smart packaging choice , i think i did deduct one star because , while i like the product , the pigment intensity is a bit wanting i do feel they could be more highly pigmented
5	amazing color , get a lot of compliments because of it !
5	i ordered the micro straightening styling iron because i have a natural wave curl to my hair which of course i dislike i really need something that will straighten and calm down the frizzies when humid \( which is all the time here in the midwest \) the straightening iron wand worked beautifully and gave my hair a wonderful shine while straightening all the natural flips waves i have n't tried using the curling iron part yet , but i'm confident it will perform wonderfully too
5	love this rock royalty color ! authentic cnd
5	great product ! ! ! covers thinning area very well !
5	nothing works better on rough heals put a small amount it on heals , cover with socks , wear overnight if you do for a few nights in a row , heals will be soft you have to be careful not to get it on tender parts of foot it will irritate and burn any area the does not have calluses i 've never used it on elbows so ca n't speak to that
5	i love this product ! there is a very , very light fragrance and the product is smooth with no grit the directions advise to leave on for 10 minutes and i would agree t with that timing after application it slowly starts to tingle , and it rinses off easily after my face felt soft and looked brighter love that ! i have not used the product enough times to see a reduction in pigmentation , but will report back update some of my dark spots are lighter , my skin is more even toned than before using this product
5	vichy puret eacute thermale 3 in 1 micellar water is formulated to cleanse , remove makeup and calm skin irritation in one easy step that just requires pouring it on a cotton pad or cotton ball and wiping the eye area and face no rinsing is required i like that this product contains no soap , colorants , oil or alcohol , but i do wish it was free of chemical fragrance too \( though at least the scent is light \) this is the best micellar water i 've tried for removing my face makeup \( though it 's not great for my eyes \) i do n't wear heavy makeup but do wear mascara , concealer , foundation and powdered bronzer , contour makeup and or blush my cotton pad is covered with makeup after wiping my face , and i 've used my clarisonic after and do n't see residual makeup on the brush i still usually prefer to also use my regular cleanser , but this micellar water does the trick when i'm tired at night as i just wipe my face it and let it air dry while i brush my teeth \( and just follow with my serum and cream \) my skin is dry and sensitive , and it feels clean and comfortable even without rinsing and does n't feel dry or irritated from the micellar water it does feel just a bit tacky without rinsing , but that feeling goes away as soon as i apply my regular serum and cream i like this micellar water for my face , but it does n't work well very for removing my lancme mascara \( which is not waterproof \) it stings my eyes and gently wiping does n't get rid of enough of my mascara i get much better results using lancme eye makeup remover and it has never irritated my eyes so i use the vichy micellar water for my face makeup and the lancme for my eye makeup i think the vichy micellar water is a good product , but i'm taking one star off because it 's not good for removing my mascara 4 stars 8 31 2017 my and work days have been really long lately , and the weather has been so hot i come home beat and one of the first things i do is wipe my face with this vichy micellar water while it 's not perfect , i 've grown to love its convenience and how it 's refreshing and removes so much makeup and grime without drying my skin out , i'm upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars
5	mom likes it
4	this seems to do a good job strengthening nails but i did n't love it as a top coat it was n't bad but was n't any better than another cheap top coat would be , as far as i can tell i 'll probably mostly use it under polish to keep my nails from breaking i also was n't impressed by the matte part was hoping it would be more matte but it was basically just less shiney than most top coats and wore off somewhat quickly
1	no different than most good exfoliating cleansers
5	i picked this up for someone to try out that has oil , acne prone skin , and i have to say that the results have been impressive unlike a lot of products advertised much in the same way , this works out well as something that does not irritate or end up drying out the skin what is more it seems to keep the amount of breakouts to a minimum , which is an amazing thing really , i have no idea how many products have promised the same result but with no impact , so this has been pretty impressive
5	the key here is blending even if you get your absolute closest color match , you will still need to seriously blend this since it is for a small concentrated area so apply this sparingly \( you can even use a small brush instead of applying from the tube \) once you have the area properly concealed , grab your beauty blender and feather out those edges blend , blend , blend if you need to add a bit more , use a brush to touch up just those areas and blend again do use a powder to set this not only will it help prevent color transfer , but it will provide a more natural appearance \( but , do be careful this will still transfer to clothing if one is n't very careful \) to the best of my knowledge , this is one of the best products you can buy to conceal blemishes , tattoos , bruises , etc it 's not absolutely perfect , but in the right hands \( patient hands \) , it can definitely conceal whatever you need concealed give it a try ! highly recommended !
2	this product is so thick it feels more like a body lotion than a facial moisturizer it is odorless , except for a slightly off odor , like it 's old the bottle is dated 2012 , but there is no expiration date the list of ingredients include shea butter and mango butter that probably explains the thickness of the product this 1 7 ounce pump style container will not last long as it 's simply not a large amount of product it 's called hydrate but i do n't see how all these heavy butters and gums can hydrate my face it feels like a lotion one should put on their skin when out in the sun , but not something to use as a facial moisturizer so i do n't like the consistency , and really do not care for the odd odor i do n't like it
5	love it !
5	people in the u k have made this the number one moisturizing cream in the country , and i can see why i purchased a try me trio if products , and am so very pleased with all of them the scent of all of the products i have tried is fresh and clean if this scent was made into a day parfume it would sell out marine creams are all the rage , and this gel to cream formulation , helps to moisturize my skin antiaging ingredients help improve the look of my skin while helping to reduce lines i never miss a day without a moisturizer and this one is light enough to apply under my makeup or to wear just by itself this is top of the line and top quality this is both light and non greasy the pro collagen marine cream is formulated with marine algae , padina pavonica , , and ginkgo biloba i use this every morning i apply a pea size amount into my hands , and gently smooth over my face and neck my face feels much smoother and softer i have not noticed any difference in my wrinkles or lines this product is expensive , but well worth the money only a very small amount is needed highly recommended prisrob 02 09 17
5	great color ! i love it too bad it 's discontinued
5	i have been using this product for almost two years and my skin has never been better and 99 acne free
4	i have been using sunless tanning products for many years to keep my legs from looking pale and to even out the color my skin tends toward a pasty color which looks awful i like the natural looking tan that i got with xen tan the lotion was thick , creamy , and easy to apply it had no unpleasant chemical odor like i 've come to expect with self tanners instead , it had a pleasant vanilla scent the lotion has a dark tint which provided an instant tan , however the complete tanning process takes a few hours longer the resulting color looked great my legs were tan , not orange i used the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href xen tan deluxe tanning mitt dp b002uoctsu ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 xen tan deluxe tanning mitt a nbsp and applied using a circular motion it is not necessary to use the mitt , but it did a nice job keeping my hands clean and was easy to rinse out i washed off the tanner after about three hours and the color was perfect and lasted almost a week i 've tried many products over the years with varying levels of success and find that xen tan makes some of the best
3	i am used to paying premium prices for premium cosmetics and perfume , if it is worth the cost while i like the look and feel of this product , i feel it is priced well above what it delivers for the amount you receive it made my skin feel smooth and look more uniform , but i would spend my money on porefessional rather than buy this product putting half on one side of my face and half of the vl on the other , porefessional has better qualities and can be worn solo for a more even skin tone without a full face of foundation under bb cream and foundation they were tied as a base layer there are a lot of great primers out there and i think it is vital that a gal go to the department store or sephora and try them on in person before purchasing online every formula is different and testing many makes a big difference in finding the perfect one for your skin i used to work a cosmetics counter in college and i can recommend updating your whole routine every few years because your skin changes as you age and what worked great for you at 27 may not be the best any more at 33 tip to create a flattering finish on your face after applying all your cosmetics , spray a fine mist of water on your face you can buy a can of aerosol evian , or you can get a travel sized bottle for hairspray and fill it from your or other filtered water this makes your face look more youthful by putting a microscopic dew layer on the surface that is present in young skin , in the light your skin and face will look fresher and more natural
5	this is a great moisturizer with spf for years i bought it directly from my dermatologist 's office and grossly until i found it here
4	so , at first i was really not a fan of this peel i imagined it smelling sooo delicious and well , it does n't at all it 's kind of an icky color and it has a drippy consistency i did n't love the way it felt on my face and i actually wish it would have tingled more but i have to give it 4 stars because i honestly feel like it has been working my skin is pretty prone to breakouts and i swear that after using this a couple times a week for a few weeks , they are much less noticeable not only that , but my skin feels smoother and looks a bit brighter at the end of the day , i do n't care too much what a product smells like or feels like so long as it effectively works ! i will continue to use this and will update if i notice any changes
5	i'm sooooo glad i bought this led light from cnd it works very well on my cnd shellac polish would purchase over again
3	first of all , would never spend this kind of money on a cleanser have very dry and skin that ranges from very good to reactive have been a soap and water girl for years not crazy about the scent very sweet in the way that can give me a headache the main issue is i could not get the pump to open in the course of trying to unlock , the pump broke so now i have a full bottle of cleanser that i will have to pour out carefully being its more a liquid than gel
5	i 've suffered from acne since i was a teen hard to believe i'm middle aged and still have it multiple decades later i have tried everything over the years , both prescription and otc , except for accutane i first tried this system after seeing it in a drugstore \( cvs \) i was having a major breakout and was desperate , and i noticed this had glycolic acid in it , which was a little different than the usual benzoyl peroxide salicylic acid offerings step 1 , the cleanser this is fine , just a regular salicylic acid cleanser i find it a tiny bit drying in the winter for my older skin , but my teen daughter loves it i think i like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href neutrogena oil free acne wash 9 1 fluid ounce pack of 3 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 neutrogena oil free acne wash , 9 1 fluid ounce \( pack of 3 \) a nbsp better step 2 , the toner ah , this is so nice ! in my younger , extremely oily days , i needed an extra strength astringent , but have found most too harsh now i really had n't been able to use any toner at all until i discovered this it makes the skin smooth and seems a bit moisturizing , without being greasy step 3 , the treatment an amazing discovery ! this is the only product ever in my whole life to completely eliminate blackheads i was n't even expecting that within days every one was gone i attribute that to the glycolic acid now did this system alone give me clear , beautiful skin \? sadly , no while it certainly controlled it , i was still getting the occasional painful , cystic pimples completely , i decided to a low lifestyle \( \) about 8 months ago no sugar , no junk food , only eating things found in nature within a week my face was clear ! i have not had a single pimple since then \( but i do continue to use these products ! \) i'm putting this out there because they always say acne is not related to diet , but in my case it certainly was i wish i had known this years ago ! hopefully this info will help someone else \) overall , i love this system because it 's not harsh , and it 's effective
5	this is a great product and offers good coverage with great shine i like this product on my acrylic nails and i am able to go longer between fills
5	i like this color is not that yellow hurt your eyes have very little glitter i use this in combination with opi pastel set look very nice i let here a picture to have better idea about this
5	this is a gorgeous color almost a neutral that will complement many outfits goes on two or three coats i use a base and top coat i have yet to find a nail polish that completely delivers on longevity , but this one opi shade is better than most top coat each day and repair and remove polish on any nail that looks off
5	10 styles caramel i am fair complected and this worked wonderfully for daytime wear , quicker , fits easily in a small purse , and less mess then liquid concealer i ca n't see going back
4	the ritual of ayurveda body mist is a lovely body and linen mist that smells of roses the frangrance starts off strong but the frangrance does become softer in tone i was at first put off by the frangrance but as i used it over the month i began to see that it does last for an hour or more on the skin the spicy rose aroma is uplifting in the morning after a shower or on the pillows before bed the 1 6 oz bottle had lasted well over a month with generous use if you like a spicy rose scent this will be a delightful scent i have used it in the mountains and hiking and it really does enhance with nature
1	i love most of jack black 's products but i feel like this one is a miss for me they call it a lather but it hardly lathers at all for the price , i want superior protection which i feel it did not provide so it looks like i'm going back to gels
5	the scent is amazing with just the right combination of eucalyptus and something else that i ca n't quite place showering with this after a tough workout is like going to it lathers up really well i would not say that the scent is masculine it is very gender neutral i have not used it for my hair and probably wo n't because i am very particular about it , but it cannot be beat for body wash
5	thus far , i am thoroughly impressed with the vincent longo cosmetic lines i did \( obviously \) give it five stars because i truly like it a great deal \( and will likely repurchase \) , however , in the interest of full disclosure , i feel i must also state that this is not a holy grail product for me i will also state what i perceive to be it 's and flaws with the listing first of all , i do n't think it met the claim of being truly skin like , but i also do n't know of any other product that does \( and find that to be a difficult aim for a powder finish foundation \) while applying it does come close to being skin like , but if you go the tiniest bit heavy the results are too for my taste also , i wish the listing would display the shades in \( or \) order of pigment i would like to try the shade just one shade darker than this one , but the images \( and color names , with are un \) make that difficult to discern things that make this different one \( and this may impact your color choice \) unlike other formulas which seem to dry darker \( if there is a color shift \) , this one , if anything , dries a smidgen lighter in addition , i found the application results an interesting experiment i tried applying this with a \( a beautyblender \) , with my fingertips , and with a foundation brush \( note no applicator is included \) brush treatment was by far the best result likely because it also created the result coverage develops as it dries it is very easy to use too much of this product \( a very little goes a long way , hence , i find it a good overall value \) while applying , it looks more than the finish , and that 's makes it easy to be a bit too heavy handed , and create a too powdery look for this reason , i recommend a sheer use it brightens and evens skin coverage can be considered buildable , but too much is a completely different look my skin tends to be sensitive , but it has done well with this product please note that this is designed to work with the water base primer by vl i recommend this product , but i also recommend that amazon the listing to allow some of the color choices
4	i have light skin with some imperfections as i age , i find that my skin tone is uneven , and i have capillaries that are visible as well as some dark spots on my face i was n't quite sure how this product would work for me it comes with a spatula , but instead i moistened my fingertips and applied it as i would my normal foundation i was quite surprised and impressed by the coverage as i blended it since it comes hardened in the jar it was not as easy to apply as a liquid is , but warming it with the fingers seemed to help the spread i dotted it and blended on my brown spots and it did n't seem to cake but looked fairly natural i was very pleased with the outcome so why only 4 stars well , the truth is that the hard product in the jar is n't that easy to use i did n't use the scoop and just my fingers in the jar it would be easy to overdo this it is essential to get the right color for your skin and there is a handy chart on the website to use i was thinking that a sponge might help with application , but i find that those just waste a lot of product i also use a powder to set it it is definitely thicker than my usual make up and it 's important to apply to avoid the caked on look overall , i do like the foundation and i will keep using it no reaction nor increase in blemishes noted
5	water hydro beauty products are suddenly popular , in part thanks to people who follow korean beauty trends it does n't take too long these to be picked up by other companies bliss is known for their spa and beauty products , good products but sometimes a little pricey one thing i 've noticed about their fabulous drench and quench cream is wow , it 's almost like a it 's a pale blue and very creamy , very airy , easy to pick up with your fingertips and rub into your face neck you 're supposed to rub it for about thirty seconds , so yes , it is like a min spa treatment , and in that time it does feel moist on your skin while it 's absorbed there 's no oiliness left behind , just the feeling that your face is nice and moisturized at the end of this \( i 've tried other products and i have to say , this is one of the best in that it absorbs easily without feeling greasy \) my face does appear better hydrated and more 'dewy' while using this product
5	excellent product for protecting the skin , even without makeup i have a tendency to oily skin , but this does not add a greasy feel to it i am a travel , and in the heat of summer i do n't like to wear foundation when i am working outside , so this is all i will use on those hot summer days no sunburn on the face is good
5	love it
5	grapefruit bath shower wash i like this shower gel it smells good \( of course that is an opinion \) , citrus clean , lathers really well feels gentle on my skin the scent is fairly unisex not flowery or heavy musky manly it is a really pleasant experience to use is it worth the extra expense \? maybe but i'm not sure i would pay the current cost for another bottle \( 25 \) the ingredients are not that unusual for a shower gel on the other hand , the scent is really quite good not cheap smelling it does leave my skin feeling soft very lightly scented or if you just want to treat yourself someone else i do like having splurge bath products for days i want to pamper myself if you have room in your budget , it 's a good product
5	it 's actually the color for my wedding so i'm a bit biased , but this looks amazing and essie is a fantastic brand
1	very disappointing
5	i honestly love these colors perfect shade of brown for my green eyes and the coconut for under brows have n't mixed them yet are easy to apply with my little brush and i do n't have fallout on my cheekbones after application this stuff is creamy ! have n't had any collection in my creases by the end of day and at night i wear even heavier without creases , so far i thought this is rather expensive maybe i'm just cheap , sorry !
4	like most metallic shimmer colors , this chips easier than a cream \( but i am hard on polish any time \) the color is very unusual , it is almost a cool gold , not quite tan , undertone with a warm \( not cool \) silver metallic flash in the light it goes on streaky , so needs two or three coats , although the streaks do n't show when it 's flashing silver , just when the base color shows it is not gray the base color is more prominent with just one coat
4	not since we were \( yes , i'm old \) have i had a bar of soap in the house which was this pricey but , if price is of no to you , this would be a lovely soap to have for yourself or guests first , it 's very attractive the bar is basically a creamy white , with the green stripe you see the green having a hint of translucence the overall effect one of having been poured made by hand the odor is delightful to me is was and for a man it might have been too strong a scent to carry from the shower , but i found that most of the scent is washed away so no one should object to using this bar man , woman , child so a very nice guest soap it 's perhaps too harsh for babies , but for grimy from in the summer sun it should get them clean and possibly refreshed enough for dinner
5	i love the price on this and the quality of this brand polish is great stays on and is very true to color i deep blood red !
5	in the past i have used dhc cleansing oil , but i felt like i really needed to change things up , like if i use the same cleanser for too long my poor face dries out it might be in my head , but i do like change things up i like oil based cleaners , i have large pores , combination , super sensitive skin the oil based cleansers make my face feel pumped up and dewy , without over drying my face and oddly without clogging my pores a little bit goes a long way i like to rub the oil cleanser on first , then after i have worked the cleanser for awhile i like to add the water and create a little bit of lather and rinse off i do n't like over perfumey cleansers , this has little to no scent it can clean your waterproof eye makeup off my skin did not have that painful dry feeling i almost forgot to put my nighttime moisturizer on this is really great stuff i like oil cleansers they are good for your face , the older your skin gets the more moisture it needs i would use this again
5	i feel like with the samples of juicy couture i 've been given to try one is too faint one is too strong this one has a very powerful , almost masculine , aftershave presence when first applied it does dry down to a lovely floral herb cloud that lasts a very long time , but there 's definitely a learning curve to how much to apply less is certainly more ! when you get it right , hollywood royal is a wonderful fragrance the kind you 'll get compliments on !
5	i 've been using this for a couple of weeks now , and i really like it ! it is more like a lotion than a serum , and it goes on smoothly i use about a dime sized amount for my face and neck it also has a nice smell to it , which is more than i can say for some products i 've tried after using this product for a couple of weeks , i can see a noticeable difference in two problem areas i am starting to get crow 's feet around my eyes , and i have wrinkles on my neck from weight loss both areas are starting to disappear this gives me hope that with continued use , they will completely disappear i highly recommend this product based upon my own results
3	as far as pencil liners go , the jillian dempsey eyeliner is not bad i think i 've just determined i'm more of a liquid liner girl as pencil does n't show up on me as well i do n't like a crazy dark , thick line , but i want it to be pronounced my current favorite is stila 's stay all day waterproof liquid eyeliner this pencil definitely goes on a lot better than a lot of drugstore pencils i 've found \( it 's also pricier \) , but it 's still a little muted and more smudgy than i like my eyelids are probably a bit oilier than most , but i found this pretty difficult to get on the top of my lid i have been wearing it for when i want less of a dramatic look and i have to say that it definitely comes off my eyes a lot easier in the evening than my favorite liquid liner !
5	it does an excellent job of improving completion and temporarily shrinking pores to slow oil production
5	i like this even better than the sensitive skin brush very gentle and really cleans pores well causes no problems with my either
5	good
5	this is the perfect pink and i really love it order and i do n't think you will be disappointed at all
2	i wanted to love this , because my skin needs extra moisture once i 've applied my make up and throughout the day however , if you have sensitive skin , this will more than likely irritate your skin i rarely break out anymore but something in the ingredients clogged my pores caused me to have a horrible acne breakout all over my face
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
2	i loved the color but this entire color line by essie chips very fast even with a great top coat fortunately it dries fast but i found myself having to redo my nails almost every day with all of the colors that i bought from this line making me shy away from essie for a while
4	love this color i could n't find it anywhere in the stores it was sold out you need a top coat for sure !
1	the first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly wo n't let me return and i'm very disappointed i wo n't be buying polish off amazon again i usually love essie
5	if you like cotton candy pnk ! this is for you my favorite pink essie nail polish of all time !
5	love this product ! very effective
1	this did n't work for me i could n't get the ink to come out i twisted and twisted and nothing i can say the brush is soft and about the size of a eyebrow pencil i must 've received a faulty one so i ca n't rate it as high as others
5	i have combination acne prone skin and this covers evenly and naturally the built in sunscreen is great , but i use one under as well if you are oily , use jane iredale absence primer under for hours of control i used without a primer for years , but it looks even better with one this is not the same as the loose minerals , completely different color and finish the product will not settle into pores and barely transfers once set if you use a brush as suggested on the ji site , the coverage will be lighter but much will float into the air i like the flocked sponge as i get a bit more coverage and no loss
4	all of the items in this set are finely , and precisely made maybe a little too precisely , as they 're full of metal edges that feel a little but once you get used to it \( and learn how to hold the \) it 's fine every tool works quite well their operation \( other than the file \) can be a little counter intuitive , but there are instructions even if most guys wo n't bother to look \) like another reviewer , i found the paper insert with the woman on it weird and tacky , but just like the instructions , the man i tested this kit on did n't even notice it the carrying pouch is nice other than the ridiculous price , i think this set is great i do n't see that it 's worth over a hundred dollars but maybe when it goes on sale , it 'll be a good deal
4	i really like the way this hand cream makes my skin feel soft and supple it is a thick , white hand cream it takes some time to work it into the skin and does have a greasy look initially once it gets absorbed into the skin , it leaves a sheen look but without the greasy feel i love how it leaves my dry and slightly cracked hands feeling soft and smooth one thing i do n't like is that the cream is scented and it lingers after use it 's sort of a flowery scent with a hint of menthol it is n't an smell but it lingers for hours after application for that reason , i 'd use it at night before going to bed and the smell mostly goes away by the next morning other than that , it is an excellent hand cream that does what is advertised for
5	this is the best shampoo ever ! there is a reason why it 's pricey , but it 's definitely worth the money it does n't leave my scalp flakey or dry , and is super gentle on my hair overall it 's sulfate free and great for if you 've had a blowout
5	beautiful light blue color ! !
5	great product !
5	bought as a gift for my husband after he completely ran out of all cologne \( even the old spice standby ! \) delivery was speedy and the package arrived well packed with the contents protected he \( and i \) love the scent and who does n't feel better when you know you smell gooood !
3	the green smells better too esp the one in the tube it 's still pretty good shave soap tho long lasting
3	i love men 's fragrances and wear eternity for men a lot \( even though i'm a woman \) this spray has a nice woodsy aroma that reminds me of the now discontinued men 's shower gel from bath and body i like this fragrance but the aroma lasts only about half a day i would have expected it to last longer since men 's products tend to have staying power the black misty bottle with the black bow is super attractive
5	butter london rocks even if they do not have a thinner ! this makes one 's bl nail polish last even longer !
4	the jar of this cream is huge ! there is no doubt that this will last a while , which might explain the high price tag you do n't need much of the cream as too much of the cream makes the scent overwhelming the overwhelming scent was a bit much for me as i do n't usually wear strong smelling lotions or creams the scent lasted the entire day and made my skin feel smooth
5	i use this cream on my almost 3 year face because he has eczema spots and needs a daily lotion to keep them soft and not itchy some lotions burn his spots , but this one is gentle and effective
2	this came already used if it was n't opened and used , it would be a great product !
5	i really like this cream and i will definitely purchase again ! ! !
5	cuts styling time down ! i have really fine , somewhat frizzy , hair and have used a flat iron for years , this however is so much easier to use and works nearly as well as my flat iron and takes so much less time and energy to use the flat iron would take at least a good 20 minutes to use and would inevitably the ends of my hair , even with protective spray this works in about 5 8 minutes and is way easier on my hair , takes away all the frizz and except just just a little flip on the ends of my hair leaves it straight and smooth i love it and see using it all the time !
5	i took this eye cream to the beach , and was really happy with how it performed it 's rich , but was absorbed quickly i used it at night only , because i'm tired of day creams my eye makeup after using a pump or two around my eyes at night , i noticed that the skin around my eyes looked thicker in the morning , my makeup went on smoother , and i did n't need as much concealer win ! yes , i received this for free , but i will buy more it 's good stuff !
5	mario badesco 's drying lotion is a remarkable product that not only works on overnight healing of skin eruptions but also is an excellent production for immediate relief of the thing of bug bites it seems like this small bottle lasts forever also
5	the product is excellent its hard to see the color online the bottle colors are deceiving as well this came out to be a sort of dull grey color on my nail i did n't like it , but i did n't hate it but as i said , the product itself is excellent
5	i'm going to keep this short and sweet this is the best blush i have ever purchased i normally use nars , urban decay , too faced , mac , tarte , etc , but this blush beats them all plus , it is cheaper ! ! ! ! ! and long lasting \? ! ! ! ! okay , that 's it , i'm buying more
5	this is the best eye cream i found it absorbs into the skin easily without feeling greasy the only thing i do n't like is they make this silly container with a false bottom so the container looks like it has more cream it in that there is
5	the scent is light , clean wonderful this is a thick white creamy moisturizer , i just use a very small amount at a time im a older women , my face is oily i use bioderma lightly on my face , not under my eyes i notice my face looks more youthful and smoother maybe plumper ! im not a smoker but have some fine lines above my lip after using this , those fine lines do not show up ! im thrilled right now im not thinking about botox ! lol i use a small amount on my chest , toes , and hands they feel softer , and look younger i love this so far 5 star
2	nice color but a little too light for me it has sparkles in it too , which i did not know u might like and u might not
5	another gorgeous color from opi beautiful dark green teal !
1	the bust cream is particularly absurd i bought it for my wife the bust cream is a silicone like , clear cream , with a slight scent that dries clear there 's a big difference between a slightly tight feel on your skin and actually firming breasts you need several pumps \( each pump is not much cream \) to have enough to cover your breasts the stretch mark cream is a thin , white cream with a stronger scent there 's nothing remotely medical about these cosmetic lotions i really like the mustela brand for their stelatopia unscented moisturizing lotion , and we 've used a ton of their milky bath oil when bathing our child , but these lotions are being marketed with scientific nonsense the firming agents are a joke , with trace quantities of avocado that have no medical action it 's a shame when a brand builds trust with one product , just to it with false claims on another
3	with a fragrance more reminiscent of a lime flavored green than the iconic drink , this mojito inspired lip balm applies easily the slant tip applicator is easy to use but i would describe it as a gloss rather than a balm it does make the lips feel soft and smooth but it is a bit sticky and shiny it does not last which frequent application although baxter of california produces skin care products for men , i think this one misses its mark i know few men who would wear a lip product this glossy the need for constant reapplication makes it impractical additionally i did not see an spf which would render it for outdoor activities while it does contain some healthy natural ingredients \( aloe , macadamia nut , coconut , jojoba and grape seed oils , \) , it also contains retinyl palmitate , a potential while the container design is appropriately spare , its print and its packaging are almost impossible to read this is an acceptable gloss but wanting as a balm i was n't crazy about the lime scent and i think most men would be put off by its shininess
4	it 's a nice every day wear fragrance that wo n't leave your co workers for breath this fragrance is so light that within a few seconds of spraying it , i could hardly tell i was wearing any i spritzed again on my wrist , and again , only a few \( 2 3 \) seconds later i could hardly tell it was there it has a very sweet fragrance that me a tad of summer scent , but this is more flowery than the bottle is very cool looking the bottom half is real glass \( as you would expect \) with an acrylic top that matches i am not familiar with josie natori at all never heard of the label before seems pretty good
5	pretty color , kind of a dusty rose shipped quickly , received in 2 days
5	my husband has never bought any product to help with the after shaving woes he tried this product after a recent shave and declared it a miracle worker this after shave helped soothe his irritated skin and did so without any burning feeling he said his skin felt refreshed and on the road to feeling normal again the product was non greasy and alcohol free which sounds like a great combo to me we also both loved that it is fragrance free i just might be stealing a bit of this product if i ever need it
5	excelente
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	pretty and sparkly ! arrived on time too
5	terrific product i have used this brand for the last 10 years prompt delivery
3	this shower wash has a really nice fragrance the grapefruit gives it a nice , fresh scent the gel lathers up nicely and rinses cleanly i did find the pump to be frustrating to use it only dispenses a very small amount \( just a drop \) every time you press down on it it down smoothly but is very slow to go back up all the way it takes a while to dispense enough and thats really frustrating if im in a hurry and im not sure why this wash is so darn expensive yeah , sure it smells nice , but there is nothing special about it i think that 25 for a 10 ounce bottle of shower gel is way too much the only reason i got it is because i was able to get a review sample for free otherwise , i would never spend that much for a shower gel
3	if you like tanning products , then this is a good one if not , xen tan wo n't make you change your mind pros easy to use good tan \( although not perfectly even \) cons a bit blotchy a bit greasy stains white cloth the first day
5	love this neon summer collection , and the name says a lot peachy and light , perfect !
5	this cnd shellac is very durable and stays on without chipping until my nails grow out and i have to remove it myself
5	soothing , cool , eye gel love the brand , wish they produced this product in a jar type container with a greater oz supply
1	the first coat was too thin and watery !
5	i got the gift set , not the tote i ca n't tell what is in the tote but i saw two people said something in the tote gave their baby a rash we all used all the products in the newborn arrival gift set and had no problems whatsoever \( my husband and i always test anything we use on our kids that way we know if it stings the eyes or leaves residue or anything \) all the products worked great and did n't irritate us there was a tingle to the body gel in the eyes , so do n't use the body gel as shampoo i like that this set is an easy all in one solution and great as a baby shower gift the products do not have perfumes , just clean scents the gift box comes with 5 baby products 1 foaming shampoo for newborns come out in a nice puff of foam that is easier to spread on baby 's head so i'm not her head back trying to rub the shampoo in leaves hair clean and easy to comb 2 gentle cleansing gel not a fan of gel in general since foam is so much easier to spread , but this worked well has a pleasant clean smell and no residue feeling 3 no rinse cleansing water i have not had a need to use this product on the baby but it is for when you have to give the baby a bath without water available this disappeared in my hands kind of the way gel hand cleanser does , it kind of evaporates away i can see how this would be useful for diaper changes away from a bathroom when baby wipes just do n't seem like enough 4 hydra body lotion pleasing mild smell , makes my baby 's skin soft does n't feel tacky or oily and once rubbed in feels nice and smooth 5 diaper rash cream does n't seem to work as well as the ill named cream that i ca n't type because the content filter may block it this was n't as thick still worked fine but not as quickly as the other stuff overall , the products are nice , high quality , the packaging is attractive \( albeit annoying to open \) , and the fact that they are all natural and organic is fantastic because no new mom can fault you for your selection
5	this oribe shampoo is my new favorite , i have many of the shampoos and conditioners and this seems to work the best for my hair for the first time ever i did n't have to use conditioner with this i always have to reduce tangles and frizz but with this i was able to brush through my hair with no struggle the only other product i used was the oribe shine cream and the two together go hand and hand the results were enough to impress me to buy more when i run low , my hair was smooth and had a great shine i was more impressed when i woke up this morning and my hair was not frizzy and still looked great to run to the store without washing it , a first in long long time i like this the best of the other oribe shampoos and will continue with this you do n't need a whole lot to get the sudsy action going just a very small amount , that said this will last a while and definitely worth the price i paid but since oribe tends to go up and down in price i still will pay whatever because this works so well for my hair this is the real oribe i have read reviews with their products that some reviewers were the product they purchased to be authentic i purchased through seller hair and have made many purchases through them and i highly recommend them to everyone looking for a five star seller
5	this beard oil is fantastic tames my beard and gives it an attractive luster i have coarse , dry hair , so i use it on scalp hair as well this is the single best hair oil i 've ever used , and i 've used many over the years i often find the scent of other oils unappealing \( medicinal \) or overtly feminine this proraso oil is distinctly , yet subtly masculine highly recommended
2	if you have fine , medium length hair forget it the spray smells very good but it does not add any volume to my hair
5	as usual essie has another hit ! great color for a mani pedi for summer looks great on most skin tones shipped quickly too
5	great color ! when used with my led light polish last for 2 weeks no chips
5	i 've found this to be a delightful fragrance that is not overpowering , yet lingers long after i 've applied it it has a nice balance of spice , citrus , and floral so that it does n't really fit into any of those categories it seems made for summertime with its clean , fresh scent while advertised as youthful this is not a sweet or simple fragrance it 's nicely layered it comes packaged in a clear bottle with a white design on the glass , a white cap , and a burberry tag this would make a lovely gift
3	my granddaughter found this product to be too strong she said it had a very heavy scent that smelled too much of musk and not enough of the described salts in fact she thought it was a scent for a male when she first smelled it her opinion is that it rates about 3 stars but that 's the opinion of a 19 year old college girl so bear that in mind i also thought it was very strong but i kinda liked the scent and found it to be a bit to say the least so if the opinion of an old guy counts i think it 's sexy ! !
5	i absolutely love dermablend makeup line they have truly come up with a foundation and concealer that blends amazingly there is never that caked on layered look i like that i can build on top of it and have that flawless blend that i have always sought after with my makeup but have not been able to obtain until now this particular stick matched amazingly with my own skin tones and blended in just as well it is so easy to apply you just open by twisting the top and you squeeze some out on a finger or a sponge and apply like you would any other makeup so i got one that did match my skin tones and the coverage is amazing , the concealer sticks along with the smooth camo foundation covers all my blemishes and skin irritants flawlessly that really helps boost a girls self esteem when she can look in the mirror and her cystic acne is being well covered , dermablend is created by certified dermatologist which is great because they know how to keep irritants out of the makeup they are creating , my skin does n't breakout like it does with supermarket makeup when i use the dermablend , i could n't ask for a better makeup line to have fallen in love with
5	i have been using the original strivectin neck cream for years it is one of my do n't want to live without , skin care products i was aware they came out with the serum so i was excited to get a chance to try it i love the roller application , the serum absorbs more quickly , and im not wasting product i will just wash off my hands it is just as effective as the original neck cream both the serum and the cream are not miracle workers if you already have a sagging neck it will not make that go away it will make your skin appear smoother and firmer though , not so it excels at diminishing the fine lines and tree rings that develop with age i am a value oriented shopper , and i do n't take lightly the investment i make in the strivectin products i use they are very effective and concentrated , so i do n't need to use much a tube or jar of product will last me about 6 months i consider them a very good value
4	i ordered the color candid very light but easy to blend as a fair skinned , blue eyed blonde i needed a subtle color however next time i would choose a more pigmented option
5	best conditioner i have found conditions well and leaves hair manageable without weighing it down pleasant smelling
4	this bronzer has a silky feel and is pigmented , as i 've come to expect from the lorac brand the powder is finely milled and does not feel dry to the touch the color is not too orange , but is quite light compared to other bronzers in my collection also , while the bronzer is supposed to be matte , there is a slight sheen to it i 'd call it more of a satin look rather than a true matte personally i prefer the slight sheen because it looks more natural than a true matte i have a medium skin tone and i am currently tan i am wearing makeup forever mat velvet foundation in 53 \( perfect match \) at the moment the bronzer does n't really show up on my skin very well i can use it to slightly warm up my face , but it is not usable as a contour i have attached a picture of the bronzer swatched on the underside of my arm in comparison with two other bronzers in my collection left too faced chocolate soleil \( matte \) middle lorac baked bronzer in matte tan right mac refined golden bronzer \( has some glitter particles \) as you can see , the bronzer is lighter than both of those also you can pick up the slight sheen i did n't photograph it , but it is also significantly lighter than too faced sun bunny bronzer i will update this when i have a chance to compare to a few other popular bronzers i really ca n't comment on lasting power it does n't really show up on my skin , beyond a slight warming effect that said , i got compliments on my nice tan when i wore it , so while i ca n't use it for contouring , the subtle effect is noticeable to others \) the packaging is very bulky the top is see through and it slides to the side to allow access to the bronzer underneath , there is a compartment with a brush the brush is flat and good quality it is really good for applying the powder for contouring purposes i think you would still want a fluffy brush to blend if you are fair , but i think the brush is good for application in fact , i am taking it out of the compact to use with bronzers that are better suited to my skin tone for contouring there is a nice mirror at the bottom , although i do n't love having to constantly flip between the bottom and the top to apply the bronzer while also using the mirror the packaging is also really bulky because of the brush compartment , it is very thick , so it is n't great for travel also , i do n't really love how both the top and brush compartment slide out i prefer more traditional compacts with the mirror inside the compact
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	great product ! recently back to a safety razor and had tried several different brands including the taylor of old bond street and jack black however , this product has provided the best results for me by far furthermore , i use the accompanying pre shave cream and together they are definitely my favorite these products are tried and tried for many generations no gimmicks just high quality product in simple packaging bravo !
4	this serum has a nice subtle scent and a little bit can cover the entire area it rubs on smooth and soaks into the skin well without leaving it looking shiny or greasy i have very sensitive skin and this serum did not seem to bother me at all it did little for the darker spots on my skin , however , i did notice it improving the lines i have around my eyes and mouth it made them not quite as deep and defined overall , pretty good for lines , not so much for dark spots
5	i am a face cream connoisseur and make my own , so i'm always looking for good ideas that i can incorporate into my own recipes i love this cream , but have n't figured out how to duplicate just yet it has a wonderful fresh , natural fragrance that i adore ! there is also a green apple eye cream nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href juice beauty green apple nutrient eye cream 0 5 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 juice beauty green apple nutrient eye cream , 0 5 fl oz a , but i prefer juice beauty 's stem cellular eye treatment nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href juice beauty stem cellular repair eye treatment 0 5 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 juice beauty stem cellular repair eye treatment , 0 5 fl oz a nbsp as it is more gentle on my eyes and is excellent to use with the green apple age defy moisturizer ! container yes , it 's in glass , which is fabulous ! you can save it after use \( just run it through the dishwasher \) i 'll use it for some of my homemade creams ingredients wonderful , healthy , and safe i use the ewg 's cosmetic database to look up all my cosmetics and the juice beauty products come up in the totally safe category you can find their web site by just ewg 's cosmetic database , then enter your cosmetic you want to know about this face cream has the fruit juices apple grape lemon i has all the moisturizers i put in my homemade recipe aloe vera shea butter jojoba primrose borage all of these are great for aging skin and moisturizing any age skin too there 's also lots of other plant extracts my gripe okay , my gripe is , i ca n't read the little tiny print on the box ! not enough to mark it down by any stars this is a stellar 5 star product !
5	i was looking for a polish like this for a long time i used to use this other polish called aluminum that was discontinued this does n't chip fast and i only polish my toes , i'm a and wash my hands quite often , so i ca n't tell you how long it would last on you hands this polish usually last about 2 weeks with maybe a little touching up but not much
5	my husband has been using these religiously ever since we got them and the volume and texture of his hair seems to be greatly improved he works them into his scalp and then just allows them to improve his hair texture his hair is just a tad thin but this seems to really be working to improve his hair 's texture as well as the feel of his hair
5	this set comes with 3 different products , a hydrating radiance booster , a cleanser , and a recovery balm the cleanser works really well for makeup removal and leaves a clean feel to your face and pores whereas the radiance booster gives a glow especially when used on the upper cheek bones and under the eyes , i have used this product for a few weeks now and i can see a huge improvement in my skin tone and texture as well that the lightness that comes across my makeup when applied and my skin feels well balanced after using the recovery balm it is a heavily scented product but i love the flowery scent that comes with it and the clean feeling that it leaves after use
3	pretty color but did n't cover well
5	this is a very pretty color it does n't match the bottle 100 but it 's close enough for me it 's a very bright , shimmery teal blue very stunning especially in the sun light application is very smooth and two coats covers perfectly it 's the perfect color for summer !
5	the eye dropper dispenser makes you feel like your applying some kind of magical potion or industrial compound it 's a kind of application tool i do like that the liquid is a little viscous so it stays where you put it and you can rub it in it 's the consistency of thick syrup it has a nice subtly citrusy scent that is pleasant light as for the effectiveness it seems ok definitely seems to reduce redness and inflammation , but not sure that it ultimately heals blemishes in much faster time but i will definitely keep using it as it lasts and i approve of the effort to make it organic
1	burns ! ! ! i do n't know if my skin is too sensitive for this , but i could n't use it it made my skin sting as soon as i applied it on my face very disappointed as it is n't cheap
5	this is one of the best shimmer lotions out there i highly recommend this brand the shimmer is very subtle but attractive , and the scent is not overpowering now let me share with you why i buy this shimmer lotion if you rub the shimmer lotion on bare legs it makes you look like you are wearing very expensive this is a fantastic evening look makes your legs look sleek and sexy plus it hydrates the scent is subtle so it does n't compete with your perfume i buy this brand over and over again
5	the last time i bought from dermablend was about 20 years ago back then they were known as the makeup that would cover anything i had a deep scar on my face from a dog attack and the dermablend would totally cover it as time and surgery went on , the scar is not at all noticeable now , so i do n't need the heavy duty spackle of , but i was interested in this new \( to me \) lighter foundation the product goes on easily and is not at all thick and greasy coverage is super , pores disappear 30 spf sunblock sleek looking tube and package it lasts all day , you do n't need the powder unless you are going to sweat this off or have really oily skin the only problem i have is finding the right color i wish the company would have one place at amazon where you could see all the shades , not just the four in your tone range i thought i was in the lighter tone family , but after using the bisque , i could actually go two or three tones darker and with more pink , less yellow i know the full range of colors are offered , it is just super hard for me to match them up the other thing , the names make zero sense to me i mean what is bisque \? is that like a lobster soup \? what is sienna \? camel \? \? i think numbers would be better , maybe ranging from yellow 1 to pink 1 to cocoa 1 or some naming scheme where we all have the same of the product
5	beautiful color
5	just put this color on my hands and feet luv it ! ! ! i would recommend this color to all my friends
5	i love this polish essie has so many beautiful colors it is easy to apply and stays on without chipping removes easily to try a different color or use the same color
5	best moisturizer i have ever used skin looks softer and smoother and younger and brighter \)
5	beautifully packaged and would make a wonderful gift for any new mother i have all the large sizes of the individual items included in this set and have used mustela products for both my toddler \( since my toddler was a newborn \) and current newborn the items are all useful but a few stand out namely the foaming shampoo which is great for cradle cap and is easily rinsed out this is important as in the early newborn days you usually want to get the hair washing part over and done with as soon as possible \( for me at least , both my babies were very impatient with their hair wash and would start to cry if i took too long washing the shampoo out ! \) the no rinse cleaning water \( micellar water \) is also perfect i like and use micellar water products for myself as they are so gentle and i love this product so much i use it for the horrid milk gunk that somehow appears in my newborns 's neck folds every single day even though i use a and also for diaper 2 after cleaning thoroughly using wet wipes , i use this as a final touch to freshen up the area i also use a baby micellar water product from bioderma but i prefer this from mustela the smell of mustela products can be quite strong for some people and initially i was not used to the smell and did not really like it , however now that i have used them for such a long time and the fact that they really work well and are effective for my children makes me a big fan
5	gorgeous perfect coral color
5	another great jane iredale product looks subtle , lasts all day
4	i 've used many products from the la roche posay line and have had good results being in my 50 's , i do n't have many wrinkles , but i still get acne thanks to an oily complexion this has salicylic acid , which works well for me the glycolic acid is n't something i use often because of warnings of using it and being in the sun i found that this toner made my skin feel clean and soft it was a little drying , so i 'll use it a few times a week quality brand recommended
5	i use twice a day and it 's just right for me goes on nice under my bb cream too i would recommend this product i have dry skin and i'm 50
5	works great on dry skin amazing for eczema follow up with almond velvet cream or body cream if possible use in the shower for all day moisture must love the scent of almond and like the feeling of oil this will cleanse still but leave the body soft and not greasy this company is plant based so you have no chemicals and they provide many to this company also fair which is a plus ! i highly recommend this
4	i actually see small changes in my skin , which is surprising , since i see myself everyday and do n't spend a lot of time looking in the mirror i do n't like how this product is packaged though there 's a disk you press and some cream is released , but you ca n't see how full the jar is if you loved this item , you would n't know when to purchase a new one until you finished using it i prefer using either tubes , or open jars otherwise , i was happy with this product
5	great color !
5	the smell of this cologne is fresh and light ! perfect for the man in your life we have been enjoying the smell a lot i have a super sensitive nose and often sneeze around cologne , but this one does not seem to cause that reaction !
5	great color
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	this lipstick is very bright and gets attention lip lust is an appropriate description of this color it goes on smooth and doesnt clump up on your lips i like that i can apply it and do n't have to touch it up for 3 4 hours 15 minutes after i applied it , it left barely any marks on a glass that i was drinking from one negative is that even though it stays on and doesnt leave smudge marks on my wine glass , if you rub it with a kleenex it comes right off so you have to make sure not to push on it too hard or youll have to re apply but light touching doesnt mess it up which is nice
3	i 've had better results with mud masks it did tingle nicely and i felt fairly clean faced afterwards , but i did n't notice anything that made me want to use it again or suggest it to other people it is very easy to use , so perhaps it works better with other skin times than mine \? \( my skin is mostly even but with a slightly greasy t zone \)
5	i normally use la roche posay micellar cleansing water , but for oily skin that one is already very gentle but this one for sensitive skin is extremely so it almost feels like very soft water but not even as drying as plain water my skin is combination and my cheeks can get quite dry and sensitive i use a cotton pad with this micellar water and my skin feels supple and soft afterwards there 's no feeling of dryness it 's extremely gentle my skin feels clean after using it the one of weird thing about this it smells like bananas to me
5	fantastic shave
5	i do n't think this is a fake product i have n't bought the product at a salon before , but this does what it says it does so i believe its authentic the first time i used it i did n't notice much of a difference , but the second time i used it i left it in my hair overnight and in the morning i washed and conditioned like normal and my hair was very smooth i did this about three times in one week and my hair looked phenomenal , much healthier than it normally does my hair is color treated and also i straighten it so i put it through a lot of hell anyhow , i notice if i stop using it for a week or so my hair seems to kind of eventually back to its damage state so i do n't think its a permanent fix , but it definitely improves the look of the hair for a while i like it , i already ordered a second bottle
4	with so many products looking to coat or protect and so few that actually treat lips , i ordered this for my wife she 's tried a variety of solutions , and while some fill a to apply something , the results are minimal at least she likes trying to apply something , the smell , taste , etc this here is more of a treatment , and while the quantities are all but , it 's the good stuff i would n't say my wife 's lips are aging , but she feels that they are now firmer and smoother more than anything , she feels as if something is actually happening sadly it 's not all roses the quantity listed 34 oz is correct and an absolutely tiny amount i tend to leave the is it worth it question to you , as we all have different and in this case , it seems so out of whack , i dropped it to four stars , but for what it 's worth , my wife she has n't used anything better
5	foremost , i love juice beauty and ole i alternate them since i still cannot chose between these lines both are natural , organic , high end , and super effective though they are a little more expensive than some products , you can also feel more comfortable using these than olay , neutrogena , clean and clear , etc the fragrance here \( it is a natural scent as a result of the components \) , is subtle and appealing therefore , if you have to fragrance , you should be fine \( but feel free to pop into ulta , smell this , and then buy it here \) i 've used some pretty aggressive peels this is not one of those however , the results seem comparable to the more aggressive ones i 've had glycolic peels in my dermatologist 's office and this feels similar to the softness and clarity i experience with those peels \( and , this is much more cost effective ! \) it leaves my skin absolutely glowing ! \( but , do follow this up with an intense moisturizer i use nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href ole henriksen truth creme advanced hydration dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 ole henriksen truth creme advanced hydration a \) while the jar appears small , it has about a month 's worth of peels \( and i use it twice a week so , that 's pretty fantastic ! \) use juice beauty and feel good about your choice ! you will be truly impressed with the results !
1	i was hoping this would be the mineral powder foundation i was looking for it was not the lightest shade was even too dark and it made my face feel very dry and even a little itchy i only used it twice and that was enough for me
3	japonesque waterless brush cleanser , 0 15 lb this is a great product for cleaning your make up brushes i personally have to be careful when using it due to such a strong smell to it i have severe allergies and this causes flare ups for me but i do really like how well it cleaned up the brushes i tried it on and did not leave them sticky or cakey feeling at all if you are not someone who is bothered by heavy perfume like smells then it will be just fine to use just know that if you are someone who is sensative to fragrance might want to be careful with this one it is easy to use no water needed and does not take much product to get the brush clean good to use for touch ups when you might not have time for a full water cleaning of your brushes
5	finding the perfect concealer to mask dark undereye circles is something like the quest for the holy grail in my experience , covering discrete dark areas \( like a blemish or a tattoo \) is relatively easy , while it 's extremely difficult to achieve a natural look concealing the area under the eye over the years , i 've tried professional cover up in pots \( by \) , drugstore brands with sponge applicators \( cover girl invisible concealer \) and department store brands in tubes \( clinique advance concealer \) with about the same results lately , i 've been using bare minerals correcting concealer light 1 , which comes in a small pot and must be applied with a fingertip it works well enough , but application is a bit of a pain and the color does not quite match my fair sallow skintone i was very pleasantly surprised by the dermablend quick fix \( in shade 30c light \) because it 's densely pigmented , super easy to apply , blends seamlessly and does n't settle into the creases the color has a slight yellow neutral undertone that matches my skin perfectly and does n't create that dreaded overly white reverse raccoon eye i really like the stick applicator which is sized and shaped perfectly for the undereye area one thing i should add , if you do n't set with powder \( which i avoid because i'm over 50 \) , you 'll need to re apply midday , but other than that , this really is a wonderful product
4	i would be extremely impressed by this if not for how sticky it remains even long after applying i have a cell disorder so tend to get dermatitis and itchy skin from all types of things ranging from doing a bit of gardening to chemicals , sitting in the sun or even overly dry temperatures in short i itch a lot worse , i 've spent a small fortune on skin products that often end up irritating even more due to harsh fragrance or some odd chemical i have prescription heavy duty topical steroids but repeated use can actually make things worse so when possible , i attempt to go with something a bit less powerful this has basically no fragrance added so gets high marks on that it feels so so when it comes to soothing i tested on dry skin not really noticeable i tested on itches it was average what really made this a no go for me is the stickiness that remained even an hour later i had to wash it off which defeats the purpose nice big bottle for a good price makes this worth a try but it does n't dry well
4	this is a good conditioner that has a nice , mild scent it leaves my hair soft enough unfortunately i do n't have anything special to say about it it 's nice and works fine but it does n't stand out in any particular way compared to other decent quality conditioners i 've used i got this as a sample for review so did n't pay money for it , but i am surprised at the cost to me it does n't feel or work differently from other less expensive conditioners i 've used
5	love the color
5	the colors are great in this of polish and should be applied exactly as directions state and you will love it
5	i really like this eye cream it dispenses easily and effectively through the needle nose applicator it has virtually no smell and it absorbs quicker than any other eye cream i have used after application i was left with a clean and healthy skin feeling under my eyes no oily residue but a moisturized look and feel i have used plenty of different eye creams , some costing much more that baxter , and i will be coming back to this product
5	well , all is wonderful with this lovely set of three vichy masks and a cleansing water i was happy to be able to sample these in order to choose the one that i feel works the best for my skin i first tried each one on the inside of my arm to make sure there were no allergic reactions perfect ! each day i tried one of the masks , and used the micellar water either before the masks , or during the day or evening i was not familiar with this company before , except for their lip balm which is very nice apparently , this french company has been in business over 80 years , and very well received all the masks have individual natural scents that are light and subtle , nothing overpowering first up was the double glow peel \( pink \) , my 2nd favorite it goes on sticky , then you gently rub it around to get the benefit of the volcanic rock and fruit acid after about 5 minutes , rinse it off it is basically a chemical peel that does a good job of exfoliating , then leaving a nice cool , smooth , and refreshed face next up was the purifying clay mask \( white \) , my least favorite only because i happen to have very fine pores and no oily areas it spread around easily , had a nice texture , and did not feel tight , and i think it has good purifying qualities i must say that my face felt smooth and soft after rinsing , again after 5 minutes the last one , my favorite , the hydrating mask \( aqua \) is super ! it is a cool gel that is a moisturizer and no oil it leaves my face feeling refreshed , soothed , and hydrated \( obviously i have dry skin \) with this mask it can be left on or wiped off , and for the summer , it feels great ! as for the micellar water cleanser , use a cotton ball and it works well for removing makeup , is a refreshing pick me up , and does not require rinsing
5	great no hassle concealer by every measure the concealer applies smoothly and evenly with no pulling of the skin a morning application is typically sufficient for a whole day unless i exercise vigorously during the day and plan to do something later that night then i reapply the product is also easy to carry in nearly every situation
3	eye repair is always priced still , 71 is really hard to stomach the good news is that if you can afford it , it 's quite a nice product do n't expect miracles or a botox replacement but it 's well made for the eyes 5 stars if the price is irrelevant but it 's just so expensive that i'm giving it 3 stars for price performance
3	as far as foundation goes , i find this incredibly average , so i 'll break it down in the good and the bad the good decent coverage being that i do n't need heavy duty coverage , i was really pleased with this it also builds really well if you do happen to need more coverage if you happen to be super pale , japonesque has you covered normally i'm either the lightest or maybe one shade up , but 04 worked really well for me the dispenser works really well i did n't find the scent offensive this is a biggie for me because i ca n't stand to walk around smelling my face i'm not allergic to it the bad i found that this stuff dried fast this meant that if i do n't blend it in at lightening speed , i have ugly lines all over it hangs on to any flaw for dear life have some peach fuzz \? this will highlight it ! skipped exfoliation this morning \? dry skin accents this is made worse by the fast dry time it did n't really last over the course of the day i noticed my slight redness peeking through about halfway through the workday i work in an office , so i was n't sweating it off or anything i 'll likely finish the bottle , but will not repurchase of course , i will opt for a different foundation if i do n't do some serious exfoliation \( clairsonic style \) that day
4	with all the press about skin damage and cancer \( to say nothing of aging due to sun \) , lots of people are tanning in beds and the sun consequently , you have products like this that want to bronze you without the skin damage this spray is pretty good on that front it goes on easy , has a very light smell that goes away with time , and doesnt feel like its very thick on the skin if done correctly , it has a very nice look the key to an even , tanned look is to follow the directions ! the biggest problems come from user mistakes so , do n't just think you can spray and go on the fly while these tanners are n't as good as the real thing or professional spray tans , you can get some benefit from this product its pretty good although the price is high , a little goes a long way
4	this is an interesting product it 's definitely a peachy pink color with tiny of light reflecting off the face , what some call sparkle i put on only a little and it gives my face a nice glow too heavy and it looks clownish to me i was looking up some of the ingredients two of them are nylon 12 fluorescent brightener salt and crosspolymer i found this description of those two product together patented luminescent ingredient that emits and visible light to dramatically reduce the appearance of skin imperfections the 5 particles are undetectable by the naked eye and consist of a fluorescent core encapsulated with a \( \) the product also contains mica , a mineral , which is what i assume is causing the sparkle as light hits the mica and off
5	love this rose oil for a daily face refresh and i also love to toss it in my wet hair and let my hair dry naturally for beachy waves great product
5	have you started to get ready the morning after a late night and faced bruise like under eye circles in order to avoid scaring people , you reach for the concealer but perhaps you used a liquid concealer and found that you had to build up layers , work around fine lines , and still go back with a swab to correct your work and try to get a refreshed look or you 've gone with a powder and spent far too long dabbing away at the circles , stuck between dark shadows and a powdery look \? this concealer kit has a thick , silky cream with natural looking full coverage compared with liquids and powders , it provides better coverage with much less effort it 's light , though , so once you 've made your , you wo n't feel it the special sponge applicator has a handle , so it 's comfortable and gives greater precision the sponge on the handle has a teardrop shape that allows accurate application in small spaces apply it in the morning and expect to touch it up for evening
5	i have bought many heated styling brushes over the years with sometimes questionable results so far , this brush has been the best of the bunch my hair has gone from long , brushing my waist to it 's current super short above the neck when my hair is past my neck it needs help with volume because it does n't matter what styling gel i use it out to super straight but now that my hair is short , i was n't sure how i was going to test out this brush i usually just blast it with a blow dryer for about 3 minutes and the slight wave and cowlicks are tamed hairstyle achieved but i was surprised to find that even short hair like mine could benefit from this brush i used the brush on damp hair to a cute little hair flip the next day , i styled it against the part and then combed it back for maximum volume to create a , look i would n't say the styling options are endless , the longest part of my hair is about a 1 4 inch past my , so it 's limited but i like how sleek and shiny my hair looks after using this brush , even if i have n't conditioned my hair for weeks it looks glossy and also worth noting is the cord my last two styling brushes had wear on the cord , they broke down and had to be tossed out way earlier than i would like but this styling brush has a hardened cover over the first couple of inches of cord , right where the cord gets the most wear and tear problem solved i think this styling brush , just based on the cord alone could last several years
5	stunning color , but it does n't dry down to a glossy sheen you have to use a top coat to give it a glossy look
5	this is my first burberry perfume and i love it it has an intriguing and attractive floral scent an initial rosy scent that opens up to a boutique of jasmine , and finally a base note of musk and sandalwood very pleasant and lovely this perfume appears to be quite long lasting i could still detect a faint hint of it in the next morning i also like the beautiful package that it comes in a rectangular glass bottle that is wrapped in a classy fabric it would be a lovely gift for yourself or your loved one
5	this is the every day polish , and my nails do n't break !
5	gorgeous color ! one coat is my preferred way of wearing this color two coats makes it not so attractive looking i take this to my manicurist for her to apply since it takes special machines for curing
4	bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do i had to use a high gloss top coat i also had to layer up to get the desired coverage i wanted i would describe the color as barbie pink and i love it
5	i have been looking for a shimmer powder for well over a year and could find absolutely nothing until this came along i found jane iredale 's shimmer powder on another website first and ordered there , and then found the gold on amazon which was what i was really after i read one of the reviews about the small size of the powder , but how long it lasts i was skeptical , but after using just a bit of this powder , i could see that it 's going to last a very long time i'm looking into other iredale products as well to see what other they might have regardless , this is a real winner and will last a very long time beautiful effects
5	perfect pink ! this nail polish also does n't seem to dry out as fast as others
5	i love this cleansing oil it gives my face a glow and does n't dry me out i do feel oil on my skin even after i dry with a towel , but it absorbs fairly quickly
5	busy mom i like that i can get great quality beauty products without trying to take my kids into the beauty store
4	this review present two experiences for your consideration i guess it shows how impressions of these products can vary my wife said it felt dry rather than creamy when applying , so much so that she felt she had to apply another moisturizer on top there was also a noticeable smell which she did n't like at first not unpleasant , just strong but gradually became ok with her after a few hours i did n't notice the dry feel to the degree she mentioned it 's not as liquidy or creamy \( or greasy \) as some other moisturizer lotions but i did n't feel like i needed to apply another product on top i 've used intensive care moisturizers before which had a similar feel i noted a slight odor similar to some beauty soaps or talcum powder , but to me it was unnoticeable within a few minutes it may be that i use less than she does or i'm just \) it seems to work but hard to say if it dies a much better job than others there you have it split the difference if you choose !
5	i consider myself a beauty guru i have tried so many things to get my skin to look healthy i have very dry and sensitive skin this is the perfect extra pop of moisture or color ! it adds the perfect amount of moisture some products are so matte that it makes your dry skin worse or shows your dry patches this brings that perfect amount of glow to your skin without making it look super oily this does not feel that way if you have oily skin i'm not sure this would be for you i use this every day to set my foundation and sometimes at night if my skin feels tight from my face wash
5	ok wow ! this sultry perfume lasts almost until the next day , without overpowering at all it is delicious , yet subtle i just put some on my wrist and let the perfume do the magic i am not familiar with other calvin klein perfumes truthfully , i have in the past quite a bit of samples of the good perfumes from various companies offering them as a free gift with a cosmetic purchase i have a cosmetic bag full of them this is one of the nicest , because it does n't make me smell like i am raining perfume , or have been showering in flowers please do not slather it on , as a little goes a long way seriously , though , aside from my initial in not being able to open the cap \( it pulls off \) , i believe reveal is at the right price point at 1 7 fl oz it is a almost a rectangular shape , and with the golden cover \( top left angle \) it looks classy , and edgy i recommend this
4	i like the lacoste pour elle natural eau de toilette spray , but scent is personal im told by my husband that women tend to have more a more keen sense of smell than most men at least thats the case in our marriage i can locate the rose , raspberry , and coconut notes he just smells floral id like a bit less coconut if truth is told but i enjoy the light fragrance , though i do wish it were a bit less sweet this is a simple , scent its not dramatic and fails to enter a room with and its soft , floral , and a bit sweet , and suitable for daytime wear
4	this product keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth i would purchase this product for gifts for my family and friends
4	nice , in between aroma not too musky nor too fruity , it comes across as a fairly clean scent to me , neutral and nice
5	i have really sensitive skin so i am very careful when using new products i really like that this product is not like other exfoliators and facial scrubs because it does n't use abrasive cleansers using this product did n't feel like you are using an exfoliator it was very gentle , i did n't realize i was cleaning my face very surprising how smooth my skin feels who would have ever thought that rice milk could be such a great cleanser add in some hyaluronic acid vitamin e and you have renewed skin ready for the day !
3	i did n't have a problem opening this like some of the other reviewers granted the sticker placed on the end is hard to remove , but i got it slightly and then slipped it right off the other end of the pencil i got the blonde shade , and it 's a good shade , not green or any weird color this would work for people with brown hair also i found the pencil itself too soft i prefer a pencil made by sold on a shopping channel the brow pencil comes in one shade , is a harder pencil that does n't crumble like this one and is retractable with this laroche posay pencil , you 'll also need a pencil sharpener , not included if the pencil ever becomes unavailable , i 'll probably buy this one it 's still better than most i 've tried in the past but not better than the pencil
5	i used this cleanser for several years and it did an excellent job of removing dirt and makeup without stripping my skin and making it feel tight highly recommend
2	this is my first experience with this particular company and their products after reading the other reviews , i was excited to see how these premium products made my shaving experience so much better than the cheap stuff i currently use let me start off by describing my cheap stuff it was the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href van der hagen premium shave set 2 5 oz soap bowl brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 van der hagen premium shave set \( 2 5 oz soap , bowl , brush \) a it cost me 9 and came with the badger brush , a bowl , and a bar of soap then i bought the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href the art of shaving brush stand black dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 the art of shaving brush stand black a it was a novel idea , but it quickly got old and left it lying around in my medicine cabinet for years overall , the 9 set proved to be just as useful as this 120 set if you are a shaving snob , i suggest you stop here and give me a negative rating review , because you 're just going to get more off farther down this shave kit is very small , what i would consider sample sizes for all of the items the sandalwood smells good and works about as good as anything \( soap , shampoo , lotion , whatever \) , but you only get about 2 weeks of shaves worth out of this if you use it the way you 're supposed to \( as described on the page w the video and descriptions \) the pre shave oil spreads nicely , but is not much different or better than the gillette pre shave balm i normally use , also from the dollar store the shave cream is thick and very luxurious , i 've yet to find an equal for that stuff \( hence the second star that i to this product ! \) the after shave lotion does make my skin feel smooth , i guess , but no than my nivea lotion that i got at the dollar store for this price , i was hoping that they would at least include the stainless steel razor and stand that the dude on the product pictures uses but no , apparently that 's a premium to me , this is not a kit , it is some stuff you can put on your face , and a brush to put on your face with this is only step one of the shaving process they do n't provide you the tools necessary to complete step 2 shave ! ! thus , to me , it should not be labeled a conclusion i got this for free through amazon vine i would never pay 120 for this product i have a 79 electric razor that i use on a daily basis that i have n't changed the blades in 3 years i am cheap , and not the demographic that the art of shaving was reaching for when pricing this product this company is likely targeting to the types of people that pay 200 on a pair of designer jeans or upwards of on a designer summer dress i'm the type of dude that for deals on used you know what i can get for 120 dollars ! ! \? i can go to a shave shop and have an old timey dude give me a hot shave with lather while one of his daughters gives me a neck massage and his son shines my shoes for 40 bucks , and that would still leave enough left over for lunch and a happy ending ! ! if you 're dying to throw away some and try this anyway b c you want to feel like a semi smooth faced , i found that you could actually buy the elements \( less the cheap low quality brush which is n't worth more than 10 15 anyway ! \) for about 80 100 total so , for sure skip the kit , \( and i would say these products altogether \) it made my skin feel nice , but not incredible or 100 of a hit to my wallet
5	smells amazing ! my favorite facial spray
4	this product looks and smells pretty scary , but it works wonders on my dry , cracked hands i definitely recommend it
5	love it !
5	i love essie for the quality and colors and i love that amazon often has a good price pleased with my polish
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	i love the color , but again i am a purple girl , and essie did not fail to deliver here either love ! ! !
4	this is a great face cleanser and makeup remover though i would suggest using something specifically made for eye makeup if you use any water proof formulas or a lot of product i love vichy products and this cleanser does a really great job on the rest of my face , but i find that i need to scrub at my eyes to get them clean with this product which is exactly what you should n't do especially ladies of a certain age there is a lot here to love it 's make of high quality fresh and natural materials by a company that is committed to providing high level experiences not a single vichy product i have used has ever caused a negative reaction or irritation on my sensitive skin and this product actually serves to sooth and cool my skin very nice
5	i am very fair skinned and have sensitive skin more often than not , most foundations cause skin irritation or just do not look natural however , this is not the case with this foundation i really like this it is light and gentle to sensitive skin including skin conditions like rosacea it washes off easily with burt 's bees sensitive skin facial cleansing towelettes
4	mustela nourishing body gel is gentle enough for baby but gets adult faces clean too good for people with sensitive skin the gel goes on easily and rinses well there is no weird stickiness afterwards my main problem is it has an off scent , like baby powder that has it 's hard to explain but it 's not pleasing it does n't linger long after washing with it , but enclosed in a shower it 's not the most pleasant scent
5	love this spray , makes my skin so soft
3	this is not my favorite powder first , the both of the colors are really quite orange , so unless your skin is on the oompa loompa spectrum , it might not be great but , and this sort of what is says about medium to full coverage , it is relatively sheer , so when you put it on , it looks like a light spray tan \( yes , the orange kind , but not in a terrible way , just in a kind of unnatural way \) if you are in the heat or sweating , you can also expect it to look patchy if used alone some parts will look shiny , some wo n't some will keep the color , some will kind of soak into your pores , making your face feel like it 's suffocating a little i was outdoors for not very long but in florida heat , and it should have done better for fewer than 10 minutes i would strongly hesitate using it for all day wear or for performing \( i'm a , so i need makeup that holds \) in short coverage is semi sheer to medium , not full \( unless you apply some sort of base \) color is quite orange tinted feels heavy on skin and in pores not the worst , not the best i would n't recommend it when others cost less and are better
5	great mitt , really allows for smooth application and leaves no streaks very easy to use
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	this was an impulse purchase i had been thinking about how i missed loves lemon fresh from the 70s , as i have a rough time with synthetic fragrances , and loves did n't trigger respiratory issues and smelled so happy about an hour later this mens cologne appeared in my vine queue in reading that it was citrusy i decided to give it a try i have n't found a mens cologne i could handle my husband wearing and hoped this would do the trick i sprayed a spritz outside to see if it was going to be overpowering or trigger any negative response passed that test , so spritzed once in house and turned on fan to disperse still good spritzed husband when he got home really liked the citrus top note smelled of lime to me the base notes are subtle at first and have a nice depth and complexity that compliment the citrus after about an hour went back and had nice lingering hug with husband , and citrus pretty much gone and remaining scent quite different and surprisingly more intense from the starting point more musky , soapy , linen like not bad , but not what i hoped for this makes a nice home fragrance spray for who do n't like overly floral , heavy scents doesnt take much !
4	i love this product and it works well , but it is very expensive this would make a very special treat for a mom or grandma on mother 's day or birthday
4	this is a very nice concealer it goes on smooth and blends well with regular foundation and makeup it does a pretty good job of concealing the age spots and evening the skin tone good coverage with a matte finish did n't feel it 's thick or cakey , which is nice the wand applicator helps target the desired areas no irritation so far great product
5	so many products make promises for my frizzy hair this is one of the few which delivers keeps my hair very touchable
4	i have n't used one of these in years but lately i 've found myself in the market for a lash curler i 've taken to wearing night masks since i sleep in the day , but unfortunately not all of them have a space for eyelashes , which leads to unruly lashes this does n't sound awful until one such unruly lash that it wants to take up residence in your eyelid not fun as far as the basic design goes , this is a pretty good curler it 's easy to use and while i do wish that it was wrapped with plastic \( as opposed to around inside the box \) , i have no complaints about the design or its use if you 've used one of these before then you 'll know how to use this the pads are nice and soft and despite accidentally on my eyelashes at one point \( in an attempt to get it properly positioned \) , it 's slightly difficult to really do any damage with this as promised , i did n't feel any pinching or crimping while using this my only would be with the chamomile pads i do n't know if this would take a long time to see the conditioning claims , but i have n't seen any difference yet so is this better than some of the cheaper alternatives out there \? to be honest , i do n't know i have n't used any other curlers in years and the ones that i 'd used prior to that were on the cheaper side i do n't see where this has any new and but i also have to admit that i had a nicer experience with this than i did in the past
1	this dermablend cover coverage foundation is very thick and hard to work with at first i thought it was going to be smoother and work better but it was so thick it started to almost peel off of my skin a little it also stuck to my problem areas \( t zone \) and caked near the under eye the color and pigmentation of the foundation was more on the warmer side they are definitely darker than i thought it would be i would personally it was on for an hour and was already becoming blotchy
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
1	it chip my wife nails in a day if you have a nail gel nail dryer \? then stick with or go with the gel nail polish it last longer than this stuff
5	i was so surprised when i put it on , it actually covered my newly appearing age spots ! it made my skin look so much nicer now that the color is even all over it did not cover the darkness under my eyes , but it did lighten them i'm very pleased that it lasts all day go to their website for video tutorials on how to apply better yet , go to a store that sells the makeup to get the right color for your skin they have 33 different shades after you find the right shade for you , buy it on amazon for the best prices ! also , wanted to mention that i have very sensitive skin and this foundation did not cause any problems
3	this liquid camo is medium to high coverage it goes on pretty smoothly it can be layered for more coverage it doubles as a sunscreen i could n't seem to get it to blend that well even with a makeup sponge it felt tacky on my face after application
2	i started with body butter , and at first i loved how it felt on my skin , how it smelled my skin felt soft and moisturized after some time , however , as the butter had time to work deeper into my skin overnight , the rash emerged my arms are currently covered in small red bumps i did n't proceed to try any other products so , if you have skin sensitive to various chemicals , i would recommend staying away for everyone else , if you do n't mind paying a hefty price for a big tube of body and 3 small bottles of face wash , energizing mask and some miracle cream to trim your , sure , it might be more effective the box , which could be a gift box , doesnt look very luxurious , for those who are interested in gifting it
5	who would have thought that something so nearly black could be so useful \? i have this color and dark pool which is totally black and another must own what 's great about uber dark colors is that you can layer on top of them for a totally different look the first week i started off with this as a regular manicure it 's so very dark to the point of looking black two coats is all you need btw then i layered two coats of a regular nail polish top coat of that i found off of ebay wow let it dry \( i mean let it dry for hours ! ! ! \) then put cnd 's uv top coat on and marched forward another few days with another new look which was more gray silver then i put overly onyx on the tips and added black glitter for another new look it will stay this way for a few more days until i soak the whole thing off what fun !
5	dermablend is for cover up , it takes care of some really stubborn problems i 've used it for bruises on my knees and acne scars on my face if you 're in between shades like i am , it 's really easy to blend these together and you really only need a tiny bit , it goes a long way the easiest application for me has been with sponges , not brushes unless you 're working on a really tiny spot i use this for overall face coverage and my beauty blender works great with it highly recommend if you need something reliable and are willing to spend the
5	this fragrance for women comes wrapped in the signature burberry check pattern fabric i like glass bottles but the fabric wrap looks nice too , since it 's iconic burberry i have the original burberry as well as burberry brit and i like both , but love brit this fragrance is also a little more floral like brit it is meant to the spirit of london yet alive with the history of the ages burberry markets it as the fragrance for an woman with relaxed confidence it is subtle yet long lasting since i love jasmine based fragrances , i really like this one the burberry original is more fruity , followed by vanilla and musk but this fragrance is more flora the top notes are rose , honeysuckle and tangerine the middle notes are jasmine , peony , tiare flower , the base notes are musk , patchouli and sandalwood the jasmine really leads , and is very noticeable , along with honeysuckle the dry down is fabulous , as it 's musky and oriental with the patchouli and sandalwood again , it 's very long lasting , a great thing about burberry fragrances , if you can get a genuine bottle i am so loving this fragrance , i want to spray it and then sniff my wrists all day long it 's very lasting and i can smell it on my clothing even after a full day , makes me feel so sexy ! after 2 months of using it , i like it even more and more i never thought i 'd like london so much as i never cared as much for the original burberry scent or even burberry brit although my daughter loves brit as it works well with her cooler body chemistry but this one has me hooked and it works magic with my warmer body chemistry , i have even women asking me what i am wearing and have noticed men turn around when i walk by them and they get a whiff something 's working some fragrance sites have it for half the price or less , which makes me very suspicious , but previously i have purchased fragrances from some of these sites and it has been the real thing , so it may be worth taking a chance i have purchased fragrances from amazon that turned out to be fake , so make sure you buy the bottle directly from amazon as seller and not a third party seller overall , a very nice fragrance , it 's a good one for round the year it also smells very classy , elegant and fresh so i really love it for work
4	pretty happy with product wish it had a little more moisture
5	i received this lipstick to review unfortunately , i was not able to choose the color i would have liked i got aal which is kind of a peachy color , and even though i do n't love this particular color , i do love everything else about it it is very creamy and goes on smoothly it stays in place and does n't smudge easily there is no taste or smell and i really like the tube that it comes in it 's is n't hard and slippery like other lipstick tubes i do n't wear lipstick very often , but when i do , i do n't like to have to worry about it this lipstick is one of the nicer lipsticks i have tried
5	though this shave cream is a bit pricy you use such a small amount , that it lasts and lasts i'm glad that i read the amazon information before i tried it the package says to use an amount the size of a nut which nut would that be \? walnut \? \? peanut \? with or without the shell \? amazon shows to use a dime size amount , and that 's about right if you 're accustomed to using shave foam then you 're going to have to get accustomed to this style of shaving it 's not like putting whipped cream on your face , as it is with foam if you 're going to invest in this shave cream then you will probably want to do it right and also use the l'occitane cade after shave balm as well just the right combination a data hook product link linked class a link normal href l occitane cade after shave balm for men 2 5 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 l'occitane cade after shave balm for men , 2 5 fl oz a
5	my new favorite color this coral is a little sparkly , but without the excessive glitter
4	this is just a terrific product which does n't feel like the typical product \( i e hair gel \) at all using just a light touch with it and combing it into wet hair directly after showering , i found it provided a light but useful hold without even a hint of the shiny , plasticky feel of other gels this pomade provided a completely natural , plain hair look and a soft , natural hair feeling hold , far preferable to the sticky or over rigid feel of more aggressive products recommended
5	nice color was looking for a true mauve needs 3 coats to be that color , but that might just be on my discolored nails very conservative , but not that pinky color that i do n't like
4	this is a light , pretty blue facial mask in gel form , with a very pleasing , fresh scent you apply it to the skin , let it sit for a few minutes , then wipe away the excess i use prescription products on my face , so i tested this on my hands and feet it feels cool going on , and is somewhat sticky i would n't say it absorbs well , but after wiping it off , my skin felt soft and moisturized i like it !
5	beautiful color
5	beautiful shade , i really like it it 's very fancy or for any day
4	great night cream it 's fairly oily , but great for my dry skin
4	color was just a little darker than i wanted
5	there has apparently been since the last time i purchased this product , as the container is now clear instead of white i think the formula may also be slightly different because i found the application much easier than with my first jar \( not as solid , softened much easier \) i purchased this because i needed something a teeny bit darker than what i had just like i said in my quick fix review , my skin looks much lighter to the than it really is \( red hair , freckles \) , and if i use fair , ivory , light , etc , i look like a ghost so i moved down to a real medium in beige i like dermablend for a number of reasons it was originally formulated for scar coverage , so the coverage you get is going to be better than just about any other foundation despite this , it does n't look caked on if applied correctly and there are lots of shades to choose from because it covers scars very well , it also works just as well for uneven skin colors , blemishes , freckles , and just about any other imperfection you may have , again without looking cakey the foundation is also waterproof so it stays put , and it blends in very nicely so that you can feather the coverage out \( no lines at the chin and jaw \) i probably would not recommend this for someone with oily skin , because of the fact that it is waterproof \( which means it 's probably not water based \) but i would check with the manufacturer to be sure it works perfectly for my mature skin which is very dry
5	always a great face wash my mom and i both use it and when we run out our skin starts breaking out definite need
3	the menthol was a surprise for me when i was washing my face , particularly on my eyelids it felt yucky but subsided after a few minutes nothing on the bottle said to keep the product out of my eyes because i wear makeup , i like a facial cleanser that is safe around my eyes , like this might be safe for eyes , but the sensation from the menthol was disturbing on my lids i 'd likely recommend cleanser this to people who do n't wear eye makeup because of the menthol
1	did not notice any difference it even seems that my cuticles are drier
5	aaa
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
5	beautiful color , worth the money , fast shipping , and great drying time of nail polish just amazing all around
5	first , the compact this is a really nice compact that can be used for other colors as well if you like other colors i 've seen for around 7 15 it has a very nice , big mirror that is well made and does not the compact opens and closes easily , and is a good size to fit in a purse it holds 3 of the colors and the pen the top can be lifted up on one side to slide the squares out or to replace one or all of them it has a textured pattern on the top and overall is very good quality and very attractive the makeup this is a creamy powder with a lot of pigment when it first arrived , i tried a bit with my fingers this is not the optimal way of using this ! i ended up with a stripe i could not blend however , when used with a brush , these colors are easy to blend it only takes a single pass of a brush to pick up pigment , and it does not make a lot of powder waste on the compact it comes with instructions for using it on cheeks and as a whole face bronzer the colors do work very well for a very natural bronzer , and it worked well for me , and i am very fair skinned it is easy to customize it to the color you need if you have darker skin , you might simply use more of the darker color it has a little highlighter pen that is wonderful when used around the top lip , on the browbone , or on the bridge of the nose if you wish to highlight that area it is a very pearlized shade , and for me , i prefer just to use it on my browbone , under my eyebrows , and to line my upper lip with all this said , my favorite use for this is to minimize the appearance of this double chin age and weight gain has me with this is very good for contouring the chin line and minimizing the neck because it does blend so well , it is easy to blend it down into the neck without an obvious of demarcation ' without fixative , it lasted me about 8 hours in an air conditioned environment after that , i noticed it had started to fade
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	the most gorgeous powder i have used gives the lovely matte finish that i prefer
4	love spraying this on my knees and elbows works wonderfully after shaving your legs not the super sweet scent i expected like the baking extract but much more subtle and almost like a perfume the spray is an excellent way to disperse this oil in just the right amounts i spray into my hand and then rub on the above mentioned areas before it starts to run soaks in quickly too much for my face but love it everywhere else
2	i was surprised to receive red nailpolish this picture is deceiving i was expecting a pink color it shipped fast but the color in the picture is not accurate
5	this is another excellent beauty product by vichy vichy is a brand you can trust , and this wonderful elixir is no exception it goes on smooth , and leaves your skin feeling luxuriously healthy and shiny ! my wife loved it , and even i enjoyed putting it on my face ! if you are in the market for a product of this sort , look no further
5	i 'd been dying for this color from the day i saw it on the essie site , and for anyone who 's been on there you 'll know it 's been sold out for months ! finally i found it on amazon and i nearly cried it 's the most perfect pink and definitely a must have nail polish color no matter the season , hot pink is always in style , and it 's absolutely perfect for nights out ! it makes me feel ten times hotter when i'm shaking it in the club and my glowing pink tipped nails catch the flashing lights definitely buy this color ! ! ! you need it i swear
5	it was over a week before they began to chip
4	this was n't the color i wanted from the collection , but somehow i ended up buying it anyway i chose this over a lilac by essie , which was more along the lines of what i was actually looking for while i do like some shades of the purple family , i'm not huge on purple purple in general i took a chance thinking it might be a fun color , though i was really expecting to dislike it it is a bright color , but not nearly as overwhelming as some purples out there it worked well with my skin color , i figure because it has more blue than red i guess it turned out to be the super purple polish for the non fan of purple \)
5	dermablend cover creme is easy to apply with nothing more than a fingertip it applies smoothly and easily , blending dark and light spots away quickly and effectively the cover creme does not irritate my mildly sensitive skin , and even though i have excessively oily skin , dermablend stays on all day long without any need to touch up or reapply the product the coloring is as advertised and there is enough pigment in the product so that only one layer of application is needed for full cover of unwanted spots i am very happy with how well this product works , and the fact that a little bit goes a long way is a huge plus
5	works really well it says it 's for styling hair too but it 's not a holding product but a good spray for wetting and fixing bed head for example
5	use it daily light sunscreen feel but high
4	i have been using this with nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href opi expert touch pads dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 opi expert touch pads a , which are just very thin cotton paper like pads you could use cotton balls or anything like this to apply it with it looks and feels just like water the ingredients list a fragrance but i cannot smell it at all i wet a pad and use it to clean my face with , and it cleanses well i usually use multiple little pads but that 's normal for me with any makeup remover it does remove makeup well , and it takes my hard to remove mascara off it does not burn my eyes at all and it seems very gentle after use , i notice that my skin feels like it does when i first wake up a bit naturally oily i thought it might be makeup residue so i 've tried it when i have absolutely no make up on , and it feels the same i think it is the glycerin in the product my skin is dry though , so it has worked ok for me to me the only downside is that it can come out too fast when i am not careful , causing waste occasionally too , not always , but sometimes , it can leave the skin around my t zone feeling a bit sticky that area of my skin is naturally oilier , so i would think that people with oily skin might want to try to get a sample of this product if possible before investing in it it seems wonderful on my skin when it is dry and in need of moisture though
4	love the color
5	amazing ! works like magic applied to a very stubborn deep pimple and this stuff dried it up to a significantly smaller , much more shallow pimple overnight shocking results usually deeper pimples take almost a week to surface this one never did applied a second time and the drying lotion off the bacteria completely and obliterated the last bit of debris under the skin pimple never came to the surface and is now completely gone
5	wonderful product i use this product daily !
5	no complaints
4	works great as a skin moisturizer both for face and body nice for shaving and personal lubricant a small amount goes a long way
3	i am the world 's biggest fan of jane iredale 's powder foundation , but i ca n't get as excited about this concealer i do n't hate the concealer itself , and figure it is probably the best out there for my skin \( rosacea \) , but i really hate the applicator i wish it were easier to use i have difficulty controlling the amount , and often squeeze out more than i want to use it 's not the amazing concealer they bill it to be , but i will continue to use it because i only use mineral make up for my rosacea , and i want the green tea extract for my rosacea break outs
5	i use this every other day , and always moisturize on top of it helped with red bumps i had between my eyebrows \( i think from waxing and it being a sensitive area \) it helped with little bumps i had on my neck area as well i was hoping this would help with my acne scars but not really , it made my skin really smooth and did n't irritate me at all
5	fantastic cover for thin hair !
5	i have an collection of fragrances , with a particular interest in sporty scents such as lacoste essential and nautica voyage , and i 've been very pleased with burberry brit splash for the past week or so it 's a nice , watery , summer , fresh smell that does n't scream boy or axe cheap it 's a fine blend of scents that also does n't overpower anyone within nasal range as many fragrances , such as anything by or axe , of cheap ingredients and overpowering musk that can only be described as i am very satisfied with how burberry brit splash smelled on me and the pleasant reactions of those around me and will continue to wear it on the appropriate occasions
3	using this cream on one side \( undereye \) for 3 weeks , then asking a 3 friends to see what they observe , letting them know i used a new product on one eye , but the regular on the other could they tell a difference between the two sides \? two could not the third picked the side with my current product pros absorbs quickly and with no greasy very limited scent to it , and it does n't linger the texture under my eye felt softer afterwards however , for the price , considering not a single friend could notice a difference , this is not a product i 'd purchase on my own
5	smells great , leaves a very subtle shimmer
3	i 've been trying real hard to see if this tightening face serum really works as advertised but so far i can barely tell if any tightening at all is occurring it 's been a little over one week of continuous usage , and i can detect only minor changes that part about giving your face it 's youthful contour is a load and what i did notice did n't last very long i do n't have a lot of wrinkles , but at 60 , i have a few that i would like to see decreased i always get a little hopeful when i get the opportunity to review these types of products , but usually i find they do n't work very well i 'll continue with this product until gone and report back if i finally see a positive , noticeable improvement
5	this is what luxury feels like i love this scrub you ca n't imagine the difference between this scrub , and the cheap sugar and salt scrubs no comparison this l'occitane body scrub is not greasy , and it leaves your skin feeling soft , silky , and polished this scrub is amazing the scrub also has a very lovely soft clean scent i have n't found a product yet from l'occitane that i have n't loved this body scrub with shea butter is really worth the extra money
5	i have reviewed this several times still the best !
4	this is a very complete and well packaged kit that requires a long term commitment to achieve subtle results very sturdy and well made whether or not these subtle changes are worth the effort is an individual conclusion theres also not a lot known about the risks associated with sending electrical into your face the process is fairly easy and for me , pain free spas provide this sort of treatment , thus it is convenient to have such a device at home i suggest you watch the various videos online before use it certainly works , though its if its worth over 400
4	i 've only been using this cream for about a month , so it 's too soon to tell if it 's doing anything to make me look younger for me it may be a case of locking the door after the horse has been , but i 'll keep trying if nothing else maybe it will prevent further what i can say so far is that i have had no adverse effects on my skin from this product my skin tends to be more sensitive than most , so i was careful when i first started using it i started by putting it only on one side of my face to see what would happen there was definitely a slight burning tingling sensation where i had put the cream , but no redness or itching the next day i felt safe enough to use it all over my face , except near my eyes , which they warn against doing i 've been using it regularly ever since , with no problems i still get the slight burning feeling after applying it , but no bad reactions , so i do n't worry about it the smell is pleasant , sort of minty , and i like the way it makes my skin feel after applying
3	the process for applying these eye masks is messy , and my face was dripping the entire time i took before and after pictures the three times i have used this and have seen no results the areas around my eyes feel a bit swollen and puffy afterwards , but do n't look different i am just not seeing anything that justifies the cost of this kit
4	i have been using the cream for about 2 weeks i do not have a lot of wrinkles \( yet \) i wanted to use the cream to see if the fine lines would disappear i really do not see any changes but my husband commented that i look less tired the fine lines around my eyes seem to have filled out the overall feel is good i like the cream as it maintains my face hydrated and feeling good i use the cream after i shower in the morning one of my concerns was that it might smell but to my surprise it has zero odor once it dries my face feels really good and i can put makeup on the cream is very expensive so you must decided if the price is worth it
2	i had such high hopes for opi 's infinite shine , but it is just not a good product i ordered the primer and top coat , plus two colors you can count on it and ca n't be beet ! the consistency of the pink , you can count on it , was awful streaky and gloppy it left brush marks that refused to smooth out after application i let the first coat dry very well before applying the second coat , but it , too , left brush marks ca n't be beet , a dark , rich red , was better , but not great the pink \( primer , 2 coats , and a top coat , began chipping the very next day what a disappointment ! i will stick to opi
4	i do n't think this is any better than the other oil treatments that i have purchased i 'd save the money
3	i like this brush but it does pull some hair out the teeth of the brush cause my hair to get stuck maybe it 's just me ! !
4	the first thing youll notice is the almost test tube glass bottle it will look beautiful in your collection the scent is clean and fresh , not overpowering or flowery my personal opinion is that it leans toward a mans cologne , as womens usually has flower , fruit or sugar notes
5	i love this subtle sparkle on top of another color or on a french mani it do not take away from the color and is very delicate love this and will use more
4	i like this a lot the coverage is good and it stays the feel is moist , but not thick or oily , and not powdery , so you do n't have to worry about accentuating facial lines it has 30 spf , which is great for my nose and the area around it , which burns very easily and has sun damage that i need to cover up \( broken veins \) choosing your color is probably the biggest challenge , because it 's not an inexpensive product i use cover girl classic ivory most of the year this product in light is noticeably darker than that without being actually dark , which makes it good for my fair skin in summer , when i get a slight tan burn still , it is a bit dark , so if you 're going to use it to cover a large area and you have very fair skin , choose a lighter shade i'm a natural brunette , and light is a tiny bit too dark for me , but usable in small amounts this product contains talc , which has mixed reviews edited to add i also received the product in ivory , for review the ivory color is lighter than the light , and comparable to the classic ivory , but with better coverage the first two ingredients of both colors are mineral oil and talc
4	i have had good luck with all the products i have bought from the mario badescu line the texture is great and it hydrates the area around the eyes i would recommend this product
3	i am not a homme but this is a fairly handy gadget anyway it is small and the ring allows it to be to a key chain it is a little less practical for clipping to a purse ring without a quick release because it 's too awkward to remove the ring when you want to use it overall , i do n't think this is as practical as carrying a multi tool pocket knife the clippers are nice , but the nail file did n't work well for me assuming that the user is going to use this for a quick touch up and not actual nail grooming , i do n't see the point of a file that does n't work well and clippers i was surprised that the little scissors do seem to work well , but i 'd think anyone with large hands \( like the aforementioned \) would have trouble using them the knife is quite sharp and works pretty well for a tiny blade a nice idea , a nice size , but would have been more practical with a of the tools included i think i 'll stick to my other red handled , famous name combo pricing was not available at the time this review was written , but price in comparison to similar products would be an important consideration
4	bottle services goes on matte so if you like that shine which i do i had to use a high gloss top coat i also had to layer up to get the desired coverage i wanted i would describe the color as barbie pink and i love it
5	nice color no irritation love it !
4	strong fragrance probably too strong for some occasions it leaves skin smooth without a greasy residue very nice product with the great scent of eternity now this will last a long time
4	what i thought it would be

5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
4	nothing like butter london nail lacquer i found that lee did not work well with my salon gel manicure
3	i tried happy buddha and it has a citrus , woodsy smell that reminds me a lot of the spas and temples in or well , this is probably bad but it gives me a warm fuzzy feeling because it reminds me of when my mom would polish our wood furniture with orange smelling wood cleaner or of the oranges and incense of my mother 's home temple so , its not a bad scent its just not a scent that i would spray on me when i did spray it on me , there was no lasting power and it dissipated within 15 minutes with that said , i will probably use it as an air freshener for my office , bathroom , or bedroom now , i have not tried their other scents so i am unsure how the others smell , but i assume they also do not have have any staying powder and you would have to reapply throughout the day
4	light moisturizer for day use
5	i recently had the chance to order cover creme , blurring mousse and leg and body makeup being already familiar with the products , i was happy to be offered more my story is personal we have best friends , another couple , that visit us , or we visit them , at least once a year we go on combined vacations together every three to five years wed spent a lot of time together before i learned that my friends face is almost completely covered in it was a surprise to learn she had to apply makeup to look like shes not wearing makeup weve sat together many times since , just while she goes through the process of what she calls putting on my face its interesting to watch and ive asked lots of questions she applies two liquid foundations and a powder foundation , followed by setting powder ive watched at least a dozen times and still find it dramatic its not a process that can be rushed if done right , but when it is , it can last a very long time we and our were up almost twenty straight hours when weather with our flight home coming out of the airport and into the sun , she asked me how she was holding up i was amazed that if anyone needed a touchup , it was n't her id accepted for decades the dark circles under my eyes every allergy season she gifted me a tube of dermablend camo concealer and a little jar of setting powder she nailed the shade perfectly \( light sesame \) \( i picked natural and been wrong \) i think dermablend is amazing for the coverage it provides from so little product if you were counting on dermablend to help change your life , i get it because ive seen it happen if you are n't satisfied that it looks real or natural , i suggest that you explore more of the options dermablend provides pay attention to where the shade of your skin falls on the range of hot to cold tones there are plenty of tutorials on line to help one pick color \( s \)
1	it made me break out , especially my chin area to be fair though , i have very sensitive , acne prone skin however , i do recommend their cleanser which really helps to exfoliate
1	the bottle is not sealed like it should be the bottle is half full and reeks not the pleasant smell of the genuine product disappointed in spending so much only to be
4	very pretty color , fast shipping , what more could you ask for
3	this moisturizer is no better nor worse than most of the ones i use however , it claims to give you younger looking skin , and it does n't
5	this product makes my hair look healthy and fresh and bouncy ! just a couple drops is all i need for my long hair after i blow dry or curl it its perfect and it smells wonderful ! highly recommend ! ! i hope to never run out of this !
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	in the words of my wife i loved it ! i did n't even mind the floral fragrance , though it 's a bit too much i 've always felt there is no need to add perfume to facial products in my opinion they should leave out unnecessary ingredients whenever possible but in any case , i give this cream 4 stars , and it would be 5 if not for the perfume it claims to be a correcting cream for visible lines , which fills in , firms and moisturizes skin the directions are to apply it in the morning , and i found that it worked amazingly good under make up usually i use a primer , but with this cream , it was not necessary it gives a very soft look , this is definitely my 1 under make up cream right now i tried to apply it at night also , but i could n't handle the smell a it soaks into the pillow and lingers i noticed after the first time i applied it , that my skin was lifted , more firm and moisturized after using it for a longer period of time my skin looked better and firmer this cream definitely passed my test and i'm adding it to my regular skincare product list
5	i have loved pretty much every l'occitane product i have tried , so i had no hesitation about buying this in full size despite never having tried a sample and , as i expected , this is another wonderful product first off , this definitely does have a rose scent so if you do not like that scent in your body care products , you should avoid this because the scent lingers i use this after a shower at night , just on my legs , and i can still smell a bit of the rose the next morning \( i do n't like floral perfumes but i do like floral scents in bath and body products \) i happen to love the scent of this it 's not too strong and it 's not cloying , but it 's also definitely detectable it 's basically just at the right level for my preference this is super moisturizing i would say it was a lotion in terms of consistency definitely thinner than , say , a body cream or body butter , and able to be squeezed out of a relatively small opening in the top of the bottle but thicker than an oil it is easy to distribute across the surface of the skin and it absorbs pretty quickly and without leaving residue it has not irritated my skin \( and this is something i do have to watch for in body products , because a lot of fragranced lotions tend to give me hives or welts but this one does n't after a week of use \) you can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the image of the back of the container what i really like is that this has a bunch of actual rose extracts and oils \( although it does also contain artificial fragrance and dyes \) , plus the usual sunflower oil and shea butter and glycerin for moisturizing purposes in the end , i love how the scent lingers and this has been quite moisturizing \( as well as non irritating \) , so i'm a fan
5	love essie and i love this color one of my favorites
4	it works but buy applicator for better control
5	i loved this bright shade a lot so much that i bought two ! i am african american but i think it will work for many skin tones it 's great !
4	i love the purple color it 's not in your face purple , but almost a little more pink and soft looking the one thing that i'm still on the fence about is the flat sheen it 's not really matte and not shiny i have n't decided how i feel about that
5	love this fun color i get tired of only pink and red shades this was a great way to mix it up without the color being too young looking for this 30 something woman ! \)
5	awesome as new ! this line of product works well with my oily skin i can tell this is the real deal thank you
4	this acts like regular mousse like was common many years ago it is advertised as brass , and i did n't see a difference in my highlighted hair , and i was hoping for one it has only the faintest lavender tint , so i'm thinking there is not enough of the tint to really neutralize gold reds , since most color balancing products for are a deeply saturated purple color at any rate , it seems it will not contribute to brassiness , and it is a pretty good mousse although i do n't try to get big hair anymore , i used this and i liked that although i straightened my hair as usual , the next time i re styled my hair i used hot rollers and it actually took the curl , which i 've noticed is a problem after straightening my hair with a straightening iron not sure if any mousse would have this effect , since it is not a product i buy anymore i did get this for the brass neutralizing effects and would give that two star , but as a mousse , it is a great product
5	you can spray your hair , your body , your bed and about anything you want with this spray it is water based and does n't stain even with water based , i can pick up the sweet orange and cedar wood fragrance if you use essential oils , the fragrance is not quite the same the oils are for fragrance are typically artificial while the essential oils are made from plants the fragrance is much stronger and lasts longer than the essential oils , if you were to mix those two scents of sweet orange and cedar wood this is light enough that it does n't bother me at all and it is pleasing to the nose
5	this is a very well rounded women 's fragrance that is both pleasant and inoffensive released in 1995 , this fragrance has been around a while and with good reason some of the notes i manage to pick up throughout the day consist of lavender , cedar , sandalwood , and amber the fragrance starts out a bit sweet and with the impression it might end up being too cloying on a hot , muggy day , but within half an hour the fragrance starts drying down into a more fresh , clean , dare i say soft aquatic sort of smell that lingers mostly for the rest of the day this could easily be a year fragrance because of its inoffensive nature , many might consider it more of a generic scent with nothing particularly memorable about it but sometimes that 's exactly what you want , especially if worn in a business setting
5	bought this for my dad because he has oily , acne skin he loves it ! it smells nice and revives the skin while getting rid of the oil just do n't get it in your eyes cause u will be sorry !
5	update 10 5 15 i wanted to see how my tan would look as it fades and stopped xen tan temporarily it looked natural as it faded , and i was n't left with splotches of uneven color xen tan really makes my face look like i 've been out in the sun and got a tan my skin tone is olive , but i'm super pale as i gave up tanning more than 20 years ago i 've used quality department store self tanning products on occasion \( usually before a vacation that involves sun and swimming \) , and they worked well , but xen tan is definitely the best of all the brands i 've tried unlike the other self tanners , xen tan has a yummy light vanilla scent that dissipates after a couple hours xen tan is also easy to apply without getting streaks i 've applied it with bare hands \( just wash your hands quickly to avoid staining \) , and i 've also used disposable gloves it looks and feels like a face cream \( with a brownish tinge \) , and a dime size portion is enough for my face , neck and chest i basically apply it just how i apply my face cream , but at the end i smooth over the whole area to try and get even coverage i avoid my eyelids and getting the product too close to my eyes as my xen tan tan emerged the first time , i was surprised at how even the color was and that my face , neck and chest turned a nice golden brown tone with no hint of orange or streaks at all i 've since used my clarisonic to wash my face and could see some color from the xen tan show up on the brush , but my face still has a nice even color and glow i 've reapplied it again and will probably continue to use it every other day while the weather stays so hot if you 're looking for a self tanner , i would n't hesitate to buy xen tan it 's very easy to apply , smells great and looks so natural on my skin tone just do n't apply xen tan on a sick day from work as no one will ever believe you really stayed home sick !
4	fast shipping , product just as described
3	this trimmer cuts noise and ear hair , but not any better than any other i got it for my husband who said his last one pulled hair a bit however , he found he preferred the battery operated trimmer to this type , a manual operation he will use continue to this one though , but primarily for travel purposes
5	this is a great facewash i have pretty oily skin and this wash has done the best of any i have found at keeping the oil under control try this wash with the anthony astringent pads , great combo !
5	this is a high coverage make up , but does not look thick and on the skin it comes in a 1 once plastic jar that is ideal for travel it has a small spatula about 2 inches that can be used to apply the product on the face my first impression was that the make up was very heavy , but once applied to the skin it smooths out very even and has great coverage i am very sensitive to smells , especially on my face , and there was nothing that bothered me with this product at all i am very impressed with how nice it looks on my skin and pleased that it has a spf of 30 i am older and have a few lines in my face and was concerned that this make up would settle in the lines making me look even older i was very pleased that at the end of the day i did not have make up filled creases in my face it cost a little more than i would normally pay for foundation , but for increased coverage and a longer lasting product this is a good one this is made in canada and i have never had any issues with the quality of items made there
1	very cheap nail polish it chips very easily
4	it is hydrating and makes my skin look better at least until i wash it off i have not seen any changes to my skin otherwise but like most products usually it take a month or more it is easy to dispense and feels nice on my skin , not tacky and does n't pill one thing i do n't like is that there are n't any real instructions with this or i am not seeing them because most of the language is french so far i do n't think it is working any better than other creams i have tried , not any worse either i guess time will tell as to whether it will make a difference but the past 1 2 weeks have not made any difference after it is washed off
2	update i just found out they test on animals will never purchase again next time i 'll try 100 pure or the organic face i bought this at ulta and paid about 7 more i have always used bareminerals i mean always sadly i read their ingredients are actually quite harmful to the skin , as well as the endocrine system \( harmful chemicals build up and are absorbed through the skin \) the ewg \( environmental working group \) gives this product a great score what that means is its not harmful to your body they look at the individual ingredients and score them based on that i miss the glow original bare minerals gives , however i think my skin actually looks healthier now the coverage is moderate , not too intense i have to cover a couple acne scars with concealer pros good coverage lasts long doesnt wear off on my clothes as much as other products does n't pull oils from your skin less drying doesnt accentuate dry skin like others i 've used or settle in creases cons becomes cakey if you over apply better when used with a concealer instead of building coverage tips kabuki brush is a must , the sponge does n't provide good coverage and looks more cakey use a primer , i love ud 's primed and poreless \( gives a little coverage and hides imperfections more than most primers \) finish with a mineral veil or similar product
5	love all the pca products i have purchased ! i can see a difference within a few weeks of starting to use it the prices seem to have gone up on some products since my last purchase a bit pricey
5	love how wide this bristles are on this brush and they are so soft ! and the hand is rubber like with ridges so it nice to grip and does n't slip from your hand nice and consistent application on the skin very unique , i do n't have a brush quite like this one love it
5	i love this stuff my hair gets a little greasy after 24 hours , and i do n't want to wash my hair every day or my fine , blond hair gets damaged this stuff is great , it is not heavy and sticky like some of the dry shampoos it is light and does not the look that some of the spray dry shampoos seem to try and create , it just seems to take away the greasies and leave your hair clean and smelling fresh the only problem is the only place i can find it is sephora i wish they carried this product at more beauty supplies stores
5	last more longer as the nail salon guy said and , it does
3	the scent of this lotion is just too strong for me i 've tried it a few times and it makes me nauseous every time \( it 's usually headaches that i get from strong scents \) this scent lingers for a long time for me , and that 's with washing my hands several times throughout after a couple of times of using it , i decided to just use it on my feet i did n't think it through very well and put it on with my hands i realized my mistake and just had to suffer through it \( the scent reminds my husband of his late grandmother 's oil of olay \) it does moisturize well , though
5	love this product
5	the actual polish is a little thicker than what i'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands i love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish ! you just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go do n't clump on a thick layer ! the polish itself does not peel or chip off easily it really adheres well to the nail bed and i'm very happy with the purchase
2	this did n't work for me it produced puffiness , which is really not the sort of wrinkle minimizing i hoped for , or want i also have several red blotches , which are taking \( at least \) a few days to fade it 's not a lovely look am i allergic to the product \? i do n't think so on the other hand , there were unpleasant effects each time i tried the product , and they did not mitigate at all the next time i used the product i may try again when my skin is completely back to normal and the count is very low but i may well not for me , this has proved to be more of a skin irritant than a skin improvement
5	this is a great and very powder its ! ! ! !
5	peptides are the best ingredients for keeping skin young , healthy and firm i love obagi skin care line and this is the first time i used their peptide product on my face i use this product as a serum and apply it on my face after toner and before moisturizer this product can be used in the morning and at night the size of he product is generous too and it can last for at least 3 4 months even if it is used twice daily product absorbs well major ingredients include kinetin and zeatin , which have been clinically shown to help improve the appearance of firmness , brighten tone , and improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles , sweet almond oil , stearic acid , tocopheryl acetate \( vitamin e \) and panthenol \( vitamin b \)
4	coverage is good ! formula is on the drier side , which is nice because it stays put better i do have to re apply once or twice during the day a little bit is all that is needed to cover spots , so i anticipate this lasting me until it expires in a year or so
5	perfect
5	i 've been a lorac user for quite some time , and recently decided to try their matte eyeshadow the only negative is the does not include an applicator brush , which it should the other almost negative is the colors are extremely strong , so you only need to apply a tiny bit to get the look you need
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	favorite pca serum , only one i 'll get
4	my daughter and i love this finish cream she has super curly , thick , dry hair , so during school days she tames it by putting it in braids however , the ends frizz up like crazy as an experiment , we worked this into the ends it did not look greasy , and it tamed them into one cute curl , which lasted all day i also use it to tame the frizzies that pop up around my scalp it 's fine to use it on dry \( as in , unwashed \) hair some of the other reviewers compared this to cold cream , so i was expecting more of a consistency however , it 's more like a wax , and it did take some effort to work it in the fragrance is lovely , too i'm taking a star off for the crazy price however , a little goes a long way , so i'm hoping that that this jar will last us through the summer love !
5	good
3	super greasy the oil in the cream slightly separated in the jar i received it 's not the worst thing in the world , but it 's not the best
5	this scented candle smells delightful with fragrance of patchouli , vetiver , oak moss , liquid amber rum it reminds me somewhat of a fancy cologne for men the scent is just right , any more and it would be just a bit too sweet my husband and i typically have strong reactions to certain candles and fragrances but this candle did n't bother us in the least the selling point for me is that this candle is made out of soy wax and in the usa soy wax candles are a sustainable and burn cleaner and more slowly than other types on the market if i was choosing to gift a family member or a friend a candle , it most certainly would be made of soy wax and i think this candle is a scent they many men would favor this candle states it will burn for 100 hours give or take , 100 hours is pretty good burning time depending on how often you light it if you spill any wax somehow , rest assured that the soy wax is very easy to clean up with just soap and water the box the candle comes in is straight to the point i adore the upper class and that the packaging is n't busy simple is good and smart i am now eager to delight my senses with some of the other candles in the baxter of california collection
5	this is a pro makeup , so it definitely applies much better with tools like a foundation brush or beauty blender it 's far more difficult to get smooth , streak free coverage by using your fingers , it 's not a drug store line that said , when applied properly the coverage looks really natural on me , and does n't accentuate wrinkles and lines i find that concealer works better via brush over this foundation rather than under this foundation is more water based and does n't provide any moisture at all , which is why it lasts so long what i love most is that it lasts in hot , humid weather when i blot \( do n't rub ! \) with a tissue my makeup stays intact under perspiration i wear moisturiser and sunscreen underneath , that seems to help smooth application and it also looks divine with a primer it dries quickly , so care must be taken with application the coverage is very buildable over areas that need a bit more help , smoothing and feathering with my beauty blender again , the makeup well into areas with lighter application i have n't gotten any oxidation \( turning orange \) issues yet i love how long my blush and other makeup \( brows , eye area , around lips , etc \) lasts when applied on top of this foundation this product reminds me of revlon 's makeup except it 's thicker and applies a bit more sheer than that makeup , thus looks more fresh on the skin , and does n't make my peach fuzz show up more like revlon 's product does this makeup also passed the t zone test \( i have combination skin but am primarily dry and use retin a for adult acne \) i get greasy in this area and found that this makeup helps my foundation last rather than slide off of my face my pores look good too , which is unique for a long wearing foundation that often makes them look more apparent i love the sepia color , for my medium complexion with a bit of warmth \( i no longer tan after skin cancer showed up \) that 's perfect for summer when i prefer my face to be a bit darker to match my light self tanner i'm super pleased with this foundation ! i do prep my skin prior to application \( exfoliate regularly \) and apply serum , moisturiser , and sunscreen or a primer for evening wear my skin is also mature i 've gotten a few compliments on how healthy my skin looks \( my skin tends to be a bit blotchy naturally \) , so i'm definitely doing something right , lol 5 stars , highly recommended !
4	to me , the scent of of the valley is delightful this is not strongly scented , just pleasant the shea butter and several plant extracts make this melt into your hands does n't take a lot on to be noticeably softened my hands however are pretty chapped , in healthcare i'm washing constantly this is pleasant to put on , feels good \( on your feet too ! \) but it 's not for heavy duty moisturizing if that 's what you need
5	its a dark rich burgundy great for the fall or a night out it has really beautiful lights to it depth once again can apply thin does not streak
5	love , love , love ! stays on well and is soft on my hair color blends well and it can even be used on eyebrows ! i wish it was a bit less expensive but as any good product , it 's worth it lasts for months
3	i'm 70 years old and have been exposed to a lot of sun however , because of my age , some spots may not be sun related no noticeable difference in the dark brown spots near my forehead my wife just gave me the test and could n't see any difference either i treated one side and not the other after 22 days , both spot areas looked the same at a , someone commented that i looked pale and asked if i was okay the non spotted skin may have been lightened a little to give this effect according to the pamphlet that came with the product , this should be used in conjunction with other company products , such as moisterizer and rejuvenation that would make it a somewhat costly process i will continue to use the product until it runs out i 'll update if any change is evident
5	i use these products in a stand alone treatment i mixed 1 2 ounce 1 with 3 ounces of water \( per the website instructions \) and applied this to shampooed , towel dried hair for about an hour i then applied 2 over it without rinsing and left the mixture on for several hours i then shampooed and used a deep conditioner for about 45 minutes with heat the deep conditioner i used does contain a small amount of rice protein , which is good for my hair \( shea moisture honey mask \) but you can do an intensive protein treatment if your hair is really damaged and then follow that with a protein free mask \( shea moisture raw shea butter mask is protein free and excellent \) olaplex does not address cosmetic issues like moisture and shine so it can sometimes leave hair dry , which is why i always follow an olaplex treatment with a moisturizing mask , even if i do n't do a protein treatment too olaplex is by far the biggest hair breakthrough in many a decade it increases the number of bonds that are present in healthy hair and depleted in damaged hair any chemical or mechanical service these bonds and olaplex helps to repair this however , it is not a for total abuse and it will not restore hair to a virgin state \( although it may feel that way \) it is simply insurance when used as a stand alone treatment , olaplex will restore hair to a healthier , stronger state but if the abuse continues , you will need to do a stand alone treatment regularly to offset this my hair is color treated and highlighted and i heat style regularly , so i would have to say that my hair is quite damaged i do a stand alone treatment once a month but use 2 weekly overnight and then shampoo and deep condition the next morning by doing these treatments in this way , my hair is much healthier looking and certainly much stronger i have n't stopped the coloring bleaching or heat styling , but i know my hair can withstand this treatment much better than it could before prior to doing a stand alone treatment schedule , i did have considerable breakage my colorist uses olaplex so i 've had many in salon treatments , which did improve my hair 's condition considerably however , the real breakthrough came when i started doing stand alone treatments at home this did more to help my hair become resilient than merely using 3 weekly truthfully , using 3 did n't do much unless i used it immediately after getting 1 and 2 in the salon the week i used 3 after the salon treatment it did make a difference however , subsequent weekly treatments did much less and were n't as noticeable that 's when i switched to using 2 weekly , which did make an improvement over 3 however , the best thing i 've done for my hair in a long time was to buy the traveling stylist kit and use 1 and 2 as stand alone treatments i'm not going to add 1 to the color when i touch up my roots because the salon color brand i use is very gentle and does almost no damage i 'd rather save 1 and use it as a treatment afterward in sum , this kit is a godsend you can consult the olaplex website for info on how to use it as a stand alone treatment if your hair is damaged , it will make huge difference as long as you follow it with protein \( if necessary \) and a hydrating mask the olaplex site even to the protein and moisture steps so it 's not just my recommendation but theirs as well if your hair is not damaged , olaplex will not make a difference for me at least , it 's been a my hair is no longer breaking and i know i can grow it longer without worrying about more breakage however , i still use heat occasionally but much less frequently than before it was obvious that the heat that was causing the breakage because my colorist uses olaplex religiously so i do n't think the bleach was causing the problem i recommend for anyone who has damaged hair and wants to strengthen it it 's not a cure all but is insurance there are but only one patented product make sure you get the real deal i do n't know whether amazon sellers are legit or not and the same holds true of ebay consult the seller ratings on both sites to make sure you 're dealing with a decent seller i know that on ebay sells the real deal because i 've ordered from them numerous times and have always gotten the exact same product i get from my stylist i have no clue about amazon sellers though it 's a bit to order from amazon and i have been once when i ordered perfumed lotion so i'm leery of name brand beauty products simply because there are so many sellers here however , i would read the reviews carefully the traveling stylist kit sells for 79 retail so any price considerably less than that probably means it 's a fake if you do n't know what the real kit looks like , it would be extremely easy to dupe the real thing comes with a special measuring device for 1 and has a complete instruction booklet inside all the bottles are labeled , for professional use only and are individually sealed if you decide to risk it , be sure you the packaging carefully before you open it if there is any , promptly return it and get your money back
5	smells good and performs good give good holding power and a little sleek shine without being extremely stiff or crunchy it washes out without leaving any residue in your hair and it does n't turn into a white flaky mess while it 's in your hair you only need a little bit for good control so the tube will actually last awhile same great quality and scent as other jack black products
2	i purchased this from ulta i enjoy a couple of mb other things , so gave this a try i have sensitive , combination oily , acne prone skin this product says you can use it on either cystic acne or small acne on the skin i used it for two weeks straight on a small area of breakout on my face and did n't notice much of a change in my breakouts at all i feel like i was just rubbing alcohol with baby oil on my face \( the best way i can describe this stuff \) i do n't think it 's worth the price , and i doubt it would work on cystic acne i have gotten two cystic acne pimples last summer , so i get that rather infrequently , and ca n't comment on the product on cystic acne
4	this is a very well made and functional brush before ordering it for review i had looked at the , but wished that i could have seen it compared to something , so that is why i have included a photo the brush is comfortable to hold , with no real concern over it being slippery and it is extremely soft and light blending is very easy with it and everything considered it makes it easy to recommend this if you are looking to spend 20 30 on one
4	i am enjoying the full coverage of the powder in this compact the compact is quite nice also with the applicator and powder separated i applied the powder in the morning and it lasted all day without reapplying this shade is a tiny bit darker than i think i needed but the lighter may have been too light it covers my dark spots and blends in with my freckles my face looks more alive with this powder and does not feel painted
5	love the color it is vibrant and does not chip receive many compliments
5	this is a great product i use it to conceal my under eye bags , which are always too dark it goes on very smoothly and the color is great , it blends right in with my complexion i only have to apply it twice a day
5	love this color i bought for my daughter but i will be using this for myself as well very nice
2	i have straight fine hair and was excited to try this product the product is a lotion and the bottle top has a long straw attached to it you unscrew the top and pull it off and there is product on the straw i found this way of dispensing the product to be odd the product itself smells nice , and a little goes a long way unfortunately , it did not give my hair beach waves when i tried air drying my hair was frizzy and when i used the product with a hair dryer it dried out my ends i also did n't like the residue it left on my hair after drying perhaps this product would work better for someone with thicker hair i used the produce on several occasions and i cannot recommend it for those who have fine hair
3	this product smells great invigorating however , it did not seem to make my hair noticeable thicker if you want each strand to feel thicker , try the nexxus line
5	love zoya !
4	i got an entire set of l'occitane hand creams as a gift , all different scents this almond variety is nice for both women and men the fragrance is not like heavy perfume at all i do have very dry hands so this is n't my go to hand lotion for everyday and nighttime use i keep this in my purse for quick touch ups on the go this cream is very lightweight , and rubs in effortlessly it does not leave any greasy residue on your hands , it leaves skin feeling soft and smooth again , do n't expect this to be some miracle product for major skin issues or auto hands it 's a luxurious beauty lotion the tube is sized normally for this brand and type of lotion about the size of my palm
5	make skin feel great really really great
5	just gorgeous , richer than essie 's i'm addicted and i ca n't decide which one i like better !
5	love it came fast to will buy more
4	had my nails done 2 weeks ago and as of now just needed to remove one of the shellac 's on one nail and fix it , it was very easy to do , maybe next will be doing all of my nails
5	now that i am in my twenties , i have began using products to prevent fine lines and aging the stem cellular eye treatment is great to reduce lines if you already have then and prevent them if you do n't non irritating and it smells nice too ! great product with great ingredients
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	while the jury is still out as far as the serum 's long term results \( and the claims are , frankly , dubious \) , i like this product first , the bottle is pretty i do n't particularly like pink , but this one is attractive and solid second , although the product goes on a bit oily , it takes only a small amount of time to blend into my skin third , my face felt smooth and soft and , yes , moisturized , after using finally , while i might use other products for anti aging , i like this fine as a moisturizer
5	i did not realize this clay mask was for men when i ordered it being older , i'm very careful about what i put on my face , so this marketed to men product made me nervous , despite how much i 've always enjoyed facial masks i live in a household comprised of females except for my 13 year old son i did n't think there was much chance i was going to get him to try out the clay mask so i finally decided to give it a go myself \( what did i think would happen \? i 'd grow a mustache \? \) i slathered it on today after myself for about 15 minutes until it tightened and dried , i jumped in the shower to remove it i was very happy at how easy it came off it seemed to practically dissolve under the water and amazed at how soft my face felt to the touch when i got out i was even more surprised at the response of my skin to the treatment was it cleaner \? surely , but the most remarkable thing was how luminescent my skin was my face literally glowed i 've got to say i looked great even with a towel wrapped around my head i 'll be using the rest of this product for myself
4	the silk'n electronic pedicure file and callus remover did n't work quite as well at removing calluses as i thought it would , based on other reviews i think my problem is that i use too much thick lotion daily \( gold bond shea butter \) i did n't find it to take off calluses very well , and the roller was a mess this was using the coarse roller however , i found a perfect use for it for me i sometimes use one of the type callus removers it leaves rough edges , and i never really filed my feet down after using it before that would leave rough edges eventually once it dried up i now use the callus remover and then use the silk'n pedicure tool to smooth down the skin i also use the smoother roller on the edges of my fingers cuticles to smooth them out after using cuticle therefore , i am quite happy with my silk'n pedicure tool , even though i do n't feel it works well enough for the intended purposes
5	bliss triple oxygen to the rescue facial in a box is really easy to use and good for your skin i am sixty and it made my skin feel much softer and brighter i have n't had a facial in years and i do n't intend to go that long in between facials again this will be my go to i really love how my skin looks
5	i can truly see a difference in my skin since using this product ! definitely worth the money !
5	love this stuff ! ! !
5	great product !
5	my new favorite color this coral is a little sparkly , but without the excessive glitter
3	this foundation is dermablend 's shade it would seem to be best suited for a medium to olive complexion it goes on easily and can be rubbed into a nice even base it 's biggest plus to me is its staying power it does not just wear off easily and you have to use a good deal of water , soap , wipes , etc to remove it not that it is horrible to take off it just stays on well the trade off is you know it is there more so than some other foundations it does n't seem to irritate , but you do feel it present at least i did i thought that was a , especially at this price point it works well as a cover up though it is not inexpensive , so at 30 40 for an ounce tube , you need to love it a little does go a long way , but it is not cheap personally i think there are way less expensive foundations , such as covergirl products , that perform as well
4	as pretty much anyone knows , evaluating a particular fragrance is entirely subjective and personal with that in mind , i quite like rochas eau sensuelle and find it pleasantly fruity floral with an appealing hint of spice to counteract and balance the sweetness the bouquet which is comprised of signature white flowers plus mango and a of dried fruit , is neither overwhelming nor cloying but as fresh and clean as a warm spring day and while its complexity certainly makes a statement , it 's not so heavy that it ca n't be worn during the day as long as you take care not to apply it too lavishly to avoid over application when using a spray bottle , rather than spraying it on myself directly , i prefer the old trick of lightly spritzing the air and then walking into the cloud of fragrance i 've never gone wrong with this technique you the subtle benefit of the lovely scent without stopping people in their tracks
4	this is a nice concealer it is easy to apply i struggle with dry skin and so i have to make sure that my skin is really moisturized before i apply this or else it just accents the dry skin
5	love cnd products this smells good and is a great conditioner for cuticles and around the nail bed in general recommended
5	love my cnd !
5	i like the power of the blower
1	i was so excited about this product i 'd been using it for about a week \( on my face and body \) and my super sensitive skin actually had n't broken out at all and then it all changed first , my face began breaking out worse than it had in quite a long time , so i stopped using this on my face a few days after that , i started getting really bad breakouts on my chest , back , and shoulders i stopped using the cleansing gel entirely at that point i waited for things to clear up \( which began to happen almost immediately \) , and then i decided to give it another try just to make sure that something else was n't the culprit because i really wanted this to work unfortunately , the same thing happened with the breakouts , only this time , they showed up within a day or two i do n't know which ingredient \( s \) is to blame , but this cleansing gel just does n't work for me on the plus side , i seem to be a in that regard , so the seem to be pretty good that this will work just fine for most buyers
3	i have now attempted to use this in a few different ways my normal routine is to shower , add moisturizer , wait a few minutes \( brush teeth \) , add primer , wait a few minutes \( scrunch hair \) , add foundation then finish the rest of the makeup that routine did not work for this makeup my first concern was that this looked entirely too dark for my skin while in the bottle after rubbing some on the back of my hand however , i noticed that it went extremely pale on application so i tried it out for my normal foundation i discovered that rather than sitting smoothly on my skin it up and sat on top of the primer i tried again the next day and left the primer out of the routine to see if that made for a smoother look moisturizer , then this new foundation once again the foundation refused to stay and went patchy on me \( like oil in water it 's a strange look \) the next day was a weekend so i just it straight on my face , nothing under it that was probably also a mistake i live in and the weather here does a number on your skin so this went on much more smoothly but changed color to a much lighter shade when applied directly to my skin it also left my skin feeling rough \( probably from lack of moisture \) so now i'm at a point where i'm not sure how to properly use this i have tried it with a few other moisturizers and some of them seem to work better with it but they have to completely soak all the way into your skin before applying this or it will just sit on top of the moisturizer so though i had no issues with irritation i just could n't make this look good on me
4	i own a nuface trinity and a nuface mini while i have achieved subtle but favorable results with nuface trinity , i get lazy and do n't use the device as often as i should nuface mini looks almost identical to nuface trinity the main differences are 1 the size nuface mini is about 1 3rd to 1 2 smaller 2 the charger nuface trinity has a nice stand charging base while mini has a jack on the bottom of the unit 3 nuface trinity has interchangeable heads and comes with the trinity tool nuface mini has a fixed head 4 nuface mini is cheaper i'm not sure about power it seems similar i believe that this process works but you have to stick with it i prefer nuface trinity because it allows for more flexibility due to the heads but both are worthy and should improve your appearance , again if you are willing to stick with it
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	this looks amazing in sunlight it 's not quite a neon but it 's definitely bright and noticeable i love this color because i 've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink , and this is perfect ! the formula is typical essie kinda gloopy and thick but not too bad
4	rating this foundation has been a bit of a challenge i am experienced in using a lot of different makeup foundations , as i am a makeup artist one thing that can make all of the difference in the world is to have the correct color you can have the nicest texture , but the color can throw off the way that foundation looks a great deal this color \( bisque \) is not the correct color for me i tried it on several people before i found someone that was an okay match so that i could evaluate it more precisely what is this foundation like \? this foundation comes in a flat pan which has a lock cap on it despite the lock cap , it is not as air tight as i would like it to be the foundation itself is a cool creamy feeling pan of foundation that has very little odor to it and no added fragrance there is good pigmentation how do you apply this foundation \? the best way to apply this foundation after much experimentation is to use a beauty blender sponge which is dampened and then onto the face \( after moisturizing skin \) using the various shaped curves of the blender using a brush does not seem to make the finish go on as smoothly using fingers does not apply the foundation evenly enough when using the beauty blender \( or similar sponge \) dampened , this is good for multiple reasons it causes the foundation to melt nicely and evenly into the skin , leaving a very natural type finish using the dampened sponge also extends the life of the product which tends to dry out over time , making it more difficult to apply how does this foundation perform \? although the color was off so much that i found this foundation unflattering , the texture and surface of the foundation is nice it does melt into the skin , leaving a very natural finish using with the vincent longo water canvas primer does help it to look even a bit nicer , but i also used it with lorac primer \( used under moisturizer \) , and swanson vitamins hyaluronic acid serum under moisturizer primer with equally good results the foundation stayed on well all day into the night and did not seem to settle into the creases or turn uneven through the day i did not experience any oxidizing of the foundation \( turning orange \) either removal was easy with yes to blueberries cleansing cloths and did not leave any problems with residue , as well as yes to blueberries cream cleanser and clarisonic pros natural finish good for mature skin or younger skin when applied with damp sponge , airbrush finish no fragrance cleans of well stays on all day cons expensive inexpensive style container \( should be nicer for that money \) container not as airtight as should be not sure if they have the correct color for my skin tone \( which is important \) may not work well on some oily skin all in all this is a nice textured foundation when applied with a dampened beauty blender , it looks very natural , does not settle into the creases , and does not seem to oxidize i am not sure that anyone with oily skin would do well with this , but normal to dry skin would do well with it i would recommend a primer with it , but only a water based one i particularly liked the hyaluronic acid serum under moisturizer combination best for the price , this foundation should be in a nicer container i can see this drying out before you finish the pan of makeup i only wish i had been given the correct color to test as it really was unflattering on me it is difficult to test a foundation that looks so obvious on the skin i have given this four stars due to texture , application , time of wear , and performance for the price
4	an ok product that does n't really stand out frankly , i actually did n't like the feel of it on my face it just felt oily my face has never had dry skin issue , so perhaps this product is n't for me hard to say if i recommend it at the price , there are many other similar products that are cheaper
5	good
5	this is a phenomenal setting powder that will keep your foundation and blush as flawless as when first applied it makes your pores all but disappear right now it is hot and humid and with this setting powder my makeup keeps going strong i get home in the evening it also keeps my foundation \( dermablend \) from smudging , and i find that very important because i do public contact work it goes on white but is actually colorless the packaging is really generous compared to other brands that i have tried i 've found that dermablend products are truly worth the expense because they give you great coverage with only a slight application i wholeheartedly recommend this powder because it so tremendously enhances your appearance ! note about the application process when using this setting powder , cover the area with foundation very well and allow it to set for a few minutes then gently brush off the excess to get the best results
4	nice color my wife likes how easy it went on not too bright not too plain a cool natural tone for every day
4	i 've used 7 different brands of micellar water and they all seem the same to me the only real difference is fragrance this one definitely has fragrance , a not unpleasant medicinal smell that dissipates quickly i wish it had no fragrance the bottle is big , so big it just barely fits in my medicine cabinet the pump dispenser does n't stick up too far so i can use it without taking it out , but just barely it squirts out , even knowing this i keep splashing on my arm and countertop which is wasteful be mindful when dispensing i have combination skin , not sensitive , and do n't wear heavy makeup this removes my makeup except for mascara it does not make my face dry or leave it feeling dirty it 's a perfectly fine micellar water but i do n't feel the price per ounce is justified and i do n't like the pump dispenser
3	i was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice , the consistency and color are great , the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish only thing is it wears like regular polish , chipped by the next day and the shine becomes lackluster quickly
5	key concerns with home use tanning products are ease of application and natural results on both this product excels having applied the lotion with vinyl gloves and their sold separately application mitt , the mitt makes the task a bit easier but the color is obvious enough that it is no problem to apply evenly i have medium light skin and use products like this primarily so my pasty colored legs and arms have a more natural appearance applying once a week for 45 minutes to obtain a little color does not take much time and meets my needs the color is realistic , rather than ghastly orange and the gradual fading looks organic and , the scent is light and inoffensive a product that does not disappoint
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	this is quite a nice curling iron it seems to be well constructed and is an attractive appliance the colors are white with copper ish colored trim i expect the copper color to definitely wear off with frequent use , but for starts it 's the loveliest curling iron i 've ever seen and i guess it should be for 185 00 i have several curling irons and brushes under my bathroom sink right now and none of them compare to this one the clip that holds hair against the heated barrel is strong and the clip must be opened to release hair once it 's been curled you will not be able to easily pull it out without losing some hair so be sure to open it again the various 5 heat settings are really nice to have and are very easy to set i do n't like it very hot but my daughter has very tough hair and needs to use the highest heat setting the t3 micro twirl convertible curling iron comes \( i believe because it 's not quite super clear \) with a straight 1 25 barrel but you can purchase different sizes of barrels it heats up fast and they include a black pad to rest the hot barrel on when you lay it down on your bathroom countertop i think that was a very nice extra since it could possibly damage it if it was really hot the tip of the barrel does not heat up so you can hold it with your bare fingers if you need too still be careful though , because you have less than an inch of cool tip to hold onto the cord is nice an long and should give you plenty of room to work especially if you only have one electrical outlet and have to share the counter space with someone and the cord swivels from the end so getting your cord all curled up should n't be a problem it also has a 1 hour automatic shut off \( which i admit , i have n't tested yet \) it 's got a nice weight too it might get your arm tired for a while until you get used to it the instructions are well written with good so even if you do n't read english you can still understand it , but then i guess you wo n't understand this review lol i expect this curling iron to last me for years since it 's so pricey hopefully , i will never have to purchase another one i like this curling iron a lot but am only giving it 4 stars for now i have to give something like this some time to see how it holds up and then i will come back and update this review
5	eternity now opens with a fresh , bright scent it reminded my wife of lemon verbena it dried down to a more sophisticated subtle blend of floral and oriental notes it does not last on her skin for more than a few hours , but after it dries down it is an inviting and warm romantic scent well worth a go if you like florals and are looking for a perfume that would be suitable for an evening out
4	i do n't use a lot of make up anymore except for bb cream and a concealer for the lines and darkness under my eyes so , i thought the scott vincent borba anti fatigue corrective concealer tool with line smoothing tear drop blending applicator would be helpful with applying concealer the tear drop shape makes it easy for application \( i tried bb cream first , then next day tried the concealer \) to see if there was any difference the shape allows ease when applying either product , making it an quick fix for eye issues as for the anti fatigue aspect of the product , so far i have n't seen any improvement , which is why i gave it four stars instead of five i will update the review if over time i see any improvements otherwise , i really like this make up product
3	the store was fine received on time in new condition , but unlike many who see great results , i'm not one of them it make my skin , super soft
5	the directions state to apply this with a cotton pad and you do n't have to wash it off i , however , applied it with my hand on one side of my face , and it felt wonderful i did wash it off , and my skin incredibly soft i applied it on the other side of my face and did not wash it off , and this side too felt great this product is amazing and perfect for ageing skin
5	really great stuff creamy but does not get caked in creases wears well throughout the day a bit pricey but worth it to me i have pretty bad circles and they are really diminished with this product so glad it is also a safer alternative with healthier ingredients too !
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	this is pretty it was n't the hot pink i expected because it has a hint of orange in it but i am very fair
5	this perfume , from bottle to scent , is very attractive both to wearer and to people it that is saying a lot about it , because i am not a fan of the majority of scents out there the bottle has an simple design that is both elegant and colorful , with the upper half 's metallic gold the bottom 's glass and perfume display it looks very attractive under good lighting , adding something to while modern the bottom is also weighted well so it sits upright with ease and i do not worry about it getting cracked by the occasional as for the smell , i like the way woods or warm woods seems to capture it it has a springtime scent that is a bit floral without being too flowery and goes on light , does not overpower , and stays for a while i like the way this compliments people at work or going out , too , and think this works as an everyday scent
5	this dermablend cover creme was tested on a model with skin that tends to be oily , during an all day wedding held outside in the summer heat normally a user of the chanel product line , she applied it by first putting on her hand to warm it and make it more and then apply it with a makeup sponge her skin is olive colored and the caramel color complimented it nicely there was no caking and it produced an even layer and consistent tone covering any small skin imperfections it was used in conjunction with dermablend solid setting powder and lasted the entire day in the sun and heat without the need to reapply her conclusion that she was so impressed with the dermablend that she had seen in ads but never tried , that she was now switching from her chanel products to the dermablend line she was delighted to be saving some money as well as her previous foundation was about 20 more expensive
5	i used the sampler in a small tube
3	it 's ok i feel it is too thick ish and makes my under eye cream go on rough i would not purchase it again there are far better and lighter eye creams out there
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i love shellac and this is a must have color the price is good , the shipping is great and i am very pleased
4	five stars for the smell clean , fresh , lemony not overwhelming but noticeable just the right amount three stars for the duration after a few minutes you need to spray again or you do n't smell it at all anymore in a medium to small sized room for that price , one would expect a long lasting scent and in that aspect it disappoints it still smells lovely tho
4	this is a pretty good sunless tanning mist it has a nicer fragrance than most , and it does n't leave a greasy or icky residue behind like so many \( like jergens , ugh ! \) you do have to be careful how you spray , it takes an experienced hand anyone new to sunless tanning mists there will be a learning curve it darkens slowly , which i like , and seems to reach its full darkness after several hours it does n't last as long as i was hoping but it does fade nicely , which i think is nice overall i think it 's more than decent a little bit goes a long way \( which it should , given the price ! \) i'm not necessarily sure it 's worth the price tag , but if you 're wanting a mist in a bottle , i think this one is pretty good
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	works great ! i put this on with full make up concealer , foundation , blush , eye shadow , liners , lipstick and powder i applied it at 3 00 pm on a warm , but muggy afternoon at 9 00 pm , i took it off with cleansing cream and it looked just like it did at 3 00 , except the lipstick i did have to get a piece of paper and fan my face to dry the product , but it did n't sting my eyes or burn my skin i usually use nyx matte finish , which has a pump spray i like the way this product works better the mist is more fine and it last longer
5	excellent
3	it absorbs easily and has an ever so slight sting so i use it at night before i go to bed so it has time to work all of its 15 goodness into my skin because it is not very thick , make sure you put the drops in the middle of your palm , rub your hands together then apply to your face once applied it is not heavy or sticky in the morning i do see a nice glow so i know the active ingredients are truly active for me it is a bit cost prohibitive , but if you can afford it , i would say definitely give it a try there will be a noticeable difference in your skin
5	this is a wonderful color ! chalky pink that is perfect for spring or summer can be used with a glitter over top for a different look i am planning on trying some layering with additives and colors soon to see what else this can do all by itself it has a nice even coverage just like all shellac colors do ! very pleased with this color , looks great with any skin tone !
5	jouer is the best blush \( though most expensive \) i 've ever used it is a creamy , light tint \( i used petal on a fair complexion \) and glides on as smooth as silk and allows you to control , blend and build the level of color jouer comes in a small , shiny black plastic case with a mirror inside for on the go touch ups but you probably wo n't need to reapply as the color lasts all day twenty dollars is expensive for a blush a purely , guilty indulgence but this may be the best blush out there its the best ive ever used
5	perfect for a soft pink look for everyday or special occasions
2	this bronzer is two things it 's too dark for my light complexion and it 's as orange as it can be i ca n't figure out why it has so many positive reviews it goes on smoothly and looks fine for the first hour , then it and turns pumpkin orange the last thing i want is to look like an , lol ! i bought it in san and at the time i swatched it , it did n't appear orange at all in fact , it was a nice bronze color that appeared perfectly matte \( which it is despite the color shift \) and would have been perfect my skin is not oily but is normal , so i ca n't blame the oxidation on oil i also use a mattifying primer under my foundation , so it should n't have been an issue at all when first applied , this bronzer looks quite nice and gave me a nice nude , sunkissed look however , an hour later , i was struck by the color shift and i saw that i had orangey brown areas all over my face if you want a decent bronzer , either keep looking or try by benefit does n't change color and will give you the nice tan color you 're looking for in order to achieve a nude or look this product has totally turned me off to the balm and despite good reviews for other balm products , i think i 'll pass i definitely do n't recommend this product
5	the color is light bluish grey so , do not be deceived by the picture of the product i absolutely love quality of cnd brand so , yes will keep it as it goes practically with any summer clothes i
5	oh wow , i love this stuff it goes on like velvet and blends right in great for day or night use i forgot i had it on , and i loathe anything that i can feel on my skin or that is scented this is unscented , feels great , and i ca n't vouch for it making me look younger , but it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth , i feel younger
5	fits the original super i purchased the heat nicely and my curls look great what else is there to say \?
4	it 's big , chunky , with a strip of green the lime pomegranate version smells fresh , with a touch of citrus i love that it 's not overwhelming and is a very neutral scent it suds up nice and rinses clean i'm used to moisturizing body washes , so this feels a bit drying on my skin my husband likes it though the size is a bit too big for my hands but a good fit for him
5	excellent
5	this makeup setting kit is wonderful my makeup stayed put all day and late into the night i did use a brush instead of the puff that was included it gave me a nice matte finish it did n't cake in my lines or wrinkles love it !
5	loved it everything was easy thank you ! ! will shop again because it was so easy to do and the producta are great love that it comwes right to my house so simple , thank you , i will be buying more colors again
3	its not that i dislike the product the description of the color should be beach sand
4	love this color ! it 's so pretty and coraly goes with every skin tone
5	i like how gentle it is and the smell is just ! i love vichy products !
4	contains the following tools nail file small , small knife , scissors , nail clipper key chain material , stainless steel the small knife is not for anything heavy duty and could use a sharpening , otherwise it works well for small tasks the scissors are nice to have as my regular swiss army knife does not have them the spring for the scissors is strong and well made in addition , the scissors are rounded tip for added safety the nail clipper works well but takes a bit to get used to it small and convenient pocket tool i carry it daily
5	there are a lot of positives about growing older , but bizarre hair growth is not one of them places that never had hair in my first 30 years are suddenly \? ! nose hair , ear hair eyebrows getting bushy and , like , it grows super fast the lumarx trimmer helps keeps things in check powered by a single aa battery this little clipper is a very handy tool in avoiding the look , and it 's perfect for travel too
5	best lip balm , a little pricey but i think its worth it it last a long time on the lips and moisturizes a lot , perfect for winter
3	so far out of all of dermablend 's products , this has been the best it helps to reduce minor pigmentation issues with the skin , but not major ones it blends okay ish but feels heavy it is useless for acne scars or bumps it makes them stand out more \( so far this has been a problem with all of their makeup \) it 's not something i would get again
4	i 've been using this bliss fabulous face wash for years and noticed that compared to my cream face washes , this is relatively strong i have stopped using it during the dry , winter months but use it regularly during the summer it bubbles and has a slight scent it exfoliates and leaves my skin feeling clean i find that the bottle lasts for a long time , i rarely need a full pump to wash my face
3	this sounds like a great product and , to be honest , i like the way it makes my skin feel but also , to be honest , i'm not sure it makes my skin feel all that much better than other products i have used at much , much less the price one thing i do n't like about this pricey emulsion is the numerous ingredients i count about 36 or so first ingredient is water , of course , as is usual for many skin products , and there are also many and even good ingredients , such as those that are fruit derived and also niacinamide and hyaluronic acid , for example however , i'm not all that happy to find titanium dioxide , even if it is the last ingredient in the listing also sodium hydroxide , which is also known as or acid , can be a skin irritant and is never a favorite of mine and there 's mica , which , although not usually a skin irritant , has its dark side because of the use of child labor in its in much of the world granted , i imagine that none of these ingredients in the amounts of the formulation of the lotion will be harmful this seems to be a reputable company and most probably follows health and safety guidelines so i'm mainly rating this product based on bang for buck in that respect , i say it 's just okay i have n't noticed any lessening of dark spots and that 's supposed to be a main of using this emulsion i will say that it does make my skin feel soft and smooth but i can get the same result with less expensive products for me any skin lotion with a good amount of hyaluronic acid works the same way on my skin
5	great eyeliner its a deep brown and goes on evenly and easily when im looking for an eye liner i do not want one that i have to apply alot of pressure to acheive a good coat i do not have this problem with this eyeliner liner stays pretty good with minimal smearing during wear
5	a cream color very pretty magenta purple pink not super bright just right would recommend for others to purchase for nice summer or all seasons color
5	this conditioner softened my hair and gave it a lot of shine it is thick and that helps it stay in your hair and condition the directions suggest leaving it in your hair for a few minutes to allow it to work it comes in a very pretty container as do all obliphica products it may cost more than other conditioners , but i think it is a case of you get what you pay for
5	beautiful color ! great quality nail polish , and received very quickly
4	my wife and daughter have been using obagi products this moisturizer is a nice , lightweight , everyday moisturizer for any skin type it has a very mild scent that does not linger it is concentrated , and you only need a little for the entire face 1 7 ounces doesnt sound like a lot of product , but only a little is needed , and at this rate , it will take several months to go through the whole bottle the only reason for 5 stars was because of the price very nice , high quality product !
3	i ca n't judge what impurities are removed from my skin , as they 're microscopic i just have to be that this works that said , the mud makes my skin very dry , so i m not crazy about it i 've had mud baths in spa , and never had this problem before i did like that it was a relatively neat treatment my bathroom did n't suffer at all just my skin
5	fantastic product makes a wonderful overnight creme
2	the polish i received looks nothing like the one shown for sale it looks more similar to essie 's play date this was also the first time i 've purchased nail polish online lesson learned stick to purchasing polish in person
5	better than other spot treatment i have tried acid and peroxide helps my face anytime i have breakouts
4	this is a pretty decent item you need to put several coats on it for it to look right but once you are done it looks nice i was advised you would need a decent top coat finish on it after you are done for it to last longer it is very durable once you are done the person that i had done has been trying to pick it off for several days and it is n't coming off so it wears well the only issues that came up was you have to take your time or you can see the brush strokes and it could streak take your time when you apply the polish and you will get a really nice result
5	this cream is slightly thicker and richer than ahava 's mineral hand cream , and smells just as wonderful a positively wonderful treat
4	i have super sensitive skin and 21 is one of the few products that does not cause any burning or itching it does not take much to cover the entire face this does plump up the skin and moisturizes my skin felt soft the one drawback to this is that it does not have a light feeling i still would recommend it though for people with sensitive skin
2	as i said in a previous review , i'm new to vichy products and so had no idea what to expect as far as quality goes idealia fell very flat for me while the color was a great match and it goes on nicely , i was very disappointed with how it made my skin look and feel i applied it after moisturizing and even with that , the product seemed to clump , any dry skin areas and making them more noticeable , not less someone with oilier skin would probably love this product , and the sunscreen component is nice , but it 's definitely not for me
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	perfect ! love the push top ! !
4	this product works well as a primer , which means it is a product you would use before adding your typical styling products just used on it 's own , with no additional styling products and no heat , it does a good job of keeping frizzy flyaways to a minimum and does n't get super crunchy or stiff there is a nice , light fragrance to the product that lasts for a while but is n't overpowering i have very fine hair but a whole lot of it that can get weighed down by product and i did n't find this product to be overly heavy or super greasy for my hair type i do also have more of a wave than any substantial curl to my hair , which means i have to load up on product and drying to keep the curl i can get to stay this product is a good base to help protect my hair from those i might put it through on the days when i want to have a bit more curl
5	very nice fragrance came packaged and looking like a gift you would give someone it 's a bottle , so should last a while if used sparingly burberry is a british luxury brand , and this was made in france which my interest as well overall , excellent fragrance and nicely designed bottle
4	other reviewers noted a powdery scent i definitely did not \( and i love powdery scents like forever \) this had a slightly musky earthy scent on me it put me in mind of coco chanel \( which i ca n't wear \) it is a strong lingering fragrance even after having it on awhile it did n't change greatly that 's not to say this is not a very nice , quality fragrance like other perfumes edt 's , it 's very individual my niece tried it and was n't crazy about it my sister tried it and on her it was good in fairness , i'm giving it 4 stars on other folks it might well be a 5 star i love it scent
5	great color i love it
4	i got this for my teenage daughter , she has only acne prone skin and often has problems when her skin gets extra oily with her cosmetics it has a lotion texture and a pleasant scent i was really surprised with how well it worked on her skin as far as oil control without drying her out , her makeup was in place after a full day of school as for her pores they did get smaller , but were still visible in some areas overall this was a real problem for her , and i'm happy she is happy and that her face is getting the moisture she needs especially with the drying effects of acne treatment
4	this is exactly the dark green i was looking for to use during christmas covers well in two coats
5	best of class
3	a quality product that does n't cause skin irritation , even when applied on top of breakouts the pen like applicator is great however , i could n't match my daughters fair skin tone however and even rubbing it in does not blend it enough if you look closely at her face \( 3 feet \) it is obvious that she is using concealer otherwise i have now complaints for this pricy item that unfortunately did n't work well for me kort
2	maybe it 's what they use for the sunscreen , but this foundation settled into my pores and looked horrible i tried putting a moisturizer under it , but it did n't help maybe it would work if i use a primer , but i'm not really into a lot of fuss a young woman with smooth skin might not have this complaint the opal color was exactly right for my skin tone , which is very fair but i guess my go to product will remain nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href boots dual action tinted moisturiser dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 boots dual action tinted moisturiser \) a
5	easy as pie ! ! ! ! i'm a huge fan of self tanners and have tried everything under the sun \( ha ! \) ! this xen tan mousse is super easy to apply and the mitt is the key to how easy this self tanner goes on and does n't leave any streaking be sure to shower and exfoliate so that the application goes on and stays on the fragrance is nothing offensive but i would n't put it on when you 're starting your day off shower , exfoliate , apply and put your 's on before into bed for the night in the morning take a quick shower and be sure to moisturize i was very pleased with the color and it lasted a few days if you did back to back nights of applying the tanner you would find that the color is a bit more intense and lasts longer i have n't had any issues with the tanner staining my clothing or sheets
4	foremost , i have to agree that the price is pretty steep however , do know that if one uses the proper amount \( i e , not three or four pumps \) , then it should last a little while so , if you are buying this for your child , just explain how using more of this cleanser will not work any better than using the needed amount for me , the smell is not nearly as bad as i thought it would be so , if this was a for you , i would suggest trying it everyone is different the product does a nice job of cleansing and has good rinse when used as directed , the bottle should last a bit long than you might expect \( it is a pretty small bottle for the price \) moreover , no one ever regrets adding more natural organic vegan cruelty free products to their regimen
5	love this color
5	i will buy this product again the color is great and it feels so good will try other colors next time
5	if you have sensitive skin that dries out easily with cleansers , sun , make up , etc this is the best cleanser to use i can use this twice a day without an issue i use on my eyes with a tissue or cotton ball to remove eye makeup , no problem i love this cleanser ! !
5	if your fair skinned and need free , this is the one
4	so i love essie and the color was rich and beautiful , though the picture is not really what it looks like in person the color is more of a pink , then light coral it took almost three weeks to be delivered
5	this color is so vivid , it only needs just one coat and glossy top coat to emphasize it color seems to appear a bit darker on nails than it looks on the product picture , but it 's still vivid i 'm pretty much neutral girl when it comes to nail polish , but this was a nice and fun experience having this vibrant color on my finger tips highly recomended ! !
4	i have dry skin and i have always wanted to give cream blush a try i made sure my skin was washed prepped and once i applied this i found it to be smooth and creamy and have a nice smell also , not testing on animals makes me feel better about using it i used a blush brush to apply , but you could also use your fingers and then blend in i find this to not be glossy and to have more of a matte look which is beautiful the product size is quiet small , but i found that it did n't take much to bring color to my cheeks and i find that the size price and for how long makeup should be used for is all in line
5	essie cartel blue is a deep , rich navy blue it 's perfect for any time of the year
5	goes on smooth and easy i'm allergic to every brand except jane iredale
2	product was shipped quickly and while i do like some skinmedica products this one did nothing for me
5	the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me they earn being in a higher end category in my opinion they do not seem to be scented or too chemical the jars , tubes , compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your make ups i have many favorites among them , yet i believe they all stand very well on their own some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula , and this appears to be an optional extra also , there is a little instruction leaflet included with every product i hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line , including compatible products along the way respectively 1 loreal dermablend professional cover cr egrave me with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo \( no spf \) 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body \( no spf \) 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) i have been using loreal products since the 1980s when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out it smelled good too it was a truer color in my eyes , since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such also , some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly , and i liked them because they looked very ethereal , as with the pink violet lipstick that changed colors depending on the light i have aged , and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product , one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture i especially enjoyed the blur ones now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bag there has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here , including most recently , a lovely reddish brown shade of eyeshadow that stays put , a super mascara , another lip paint , some face tone enhancers , and a creamy to dry , light colored eye light , among others i am happy to see more high end products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike , especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd 1 dermablend cover cr egrave me with titanium dioxide sunscreen \( 30spf \) this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received , and it is my very favorite it covers my skin imperfections well my first attempt with it doesnt count , since i spread it very thin , allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through and i went out that night wondering why this was happening i hadnt read the instructions yet first of all , i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product , and second , i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have dry patches on spots now i get it ! this particular cr egrave me has to be built up gradually for me and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all this product is soft and smooth it appeared to be a very thin product at first , and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it it is lovely if i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections and when i apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended , and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream make up can be it has alone a bit of chroma to it , as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) , in my opinion , unlike many other cover products i have used alone , they gleam in the light more than my other cover make ups , without chalkiness very nice the other purpose for me is that it has a \( 30 spf \) sunscreen all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have \( 25 spf \) or lower , and not my needed \( 30 spf \) that my dermatologist recommends she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage i score 1 , 000 here for this as well as the other qualities of this line the two colors i have are both medium ones , one a bit lighter , and both appropriate for me , especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with them ive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here and i realize you may not have this type of a menu , but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else 2 loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder \( no spf \) needed the wonderful cr egrave mes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder , with the cotton puffs it hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for this particular product is very fine , not grainy , and perhaps a bit creamy it definitely blends in well it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier , keeping the cr egrave me , bases , foundations , from smudging to hands , clothing in various ways , since amazon is not going to know my exact skin color , i have experimented , i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using the various loose powder shades together dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades \( separate jars \) when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chose a what i mean is that with the lighter shade of cr egrave me i was able to get the same look with the darker powder , as with the opposite of that technique using the darker cr egrave me and a lighter powder altogether , with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match , thus prolonging my experience b also , with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face , and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks , nose , chin , forehead , i will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the medium toned translucent powders as described , allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion another plus 1 , 000 ! for me i have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally and not necessarily all over my face and neck u have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough , though you may find it unnecessary you can still have a dimensional look i like to play with the powders , yet , when i am in a rush i will make errors , not being subtle , and not dusting before other products also , i am 62 , and my baggy under eye application errors are the most noticeable i get rid of this bagginess first i will use the powders now , especially with other lighter dermablend cr egrave me applications , or with the high quality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) listed below and as well as their other foundations all definitely for photos where a shine or two really counts one thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type , for example they are nice for a youthful complexion and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with less noticeable pores , and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined in my case i am fine , and safest when i am well rested 3 loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray \( no spf \) these dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your make up applications the mist is n't as fine as i had expected , but it works for me even with dusted powders it will make a difference it is that simple for me 4 loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation \( 25 spf \) this a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder , which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look yet because i preferred the varying built up applications i achieved with the dermablend professional cr egrave me , i missed something with trying this last as before i was too quick to judge i had applied it very thick and then i went out i thought to myself that is was mask like , yet nice moist cover not only can i spot apply this creamier liquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers , i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look , then applying more product wherever as needed i also can add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray for a fresh stay with or without powders win win win 5 loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo ! ! \( no spf \) this is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator , in separate compartments while this color is quite dark for me , one quality , besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired , is that i do not see wrinkles really maybe the thin layer or the creaminess \? and the staying power , especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set refresh long lasting make up setting spray also , i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck the darker color , applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin i do know that is stretching it though i have n't tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product , since this is a very dark color however , i suppose this might possibly work though this does go on thin , and i do not think a cr egrave me or foundation is needed to get a good look very nice camo cover product ! 6 loreal dermablend professional quick fix body \( no spf \) wow again i hadnt understood at first how i can use this , as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium \( my shade \) i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me , yet thick as i applied it and silly me ! i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have double win with this product results ! this is a creamy roll up stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much i love the idea of having a smooth body skin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful , and long lasting dermablend professional leg and body make up however , im mentioning this quick fix product first as im partial to a more natural , yet youthful , look , only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through this is my personal preference it is n't quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body make up , yet it is the product i will use first especially during the day i love it 7 loreal dermablend professional leg and body make up \( spf25 \) it is so nice to wear tights , stockings , or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses , and on ankles under pants above boots however , during cooler months especially , it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look , it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing i absolutely loved the look when i put it on and then darn , i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin this might not be problematic for you with full body applications , as for me on an occasional basis as desired yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother , and will please you i believe as i have expressed that this product renders a nice , airbrushed look , and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into it just did n't muss up and rub off 8 loreal dermablend quick fix concealer stick \( spf 30 \) this works fabulously it is creamy and it stays put it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover cr egrave me , because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends , even as i am in my home , shades drawn , as my dermatologist has warned about i have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot this covers very well , looks flawless with or without other products , yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line i have it in a tan color , and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin lovely plus 1 , 000 , and very smart very nice products indeed enjoy !
3	i was expecting a little more pop with this color it 's a pretty pink , but it does n't wow me it looks kind of corporate and i'm not corporate ! i'm going to give it to a friend
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	nuxe is a uk beauty company with quite a few beauty staples , so i thought i would try out their fragrant water it 's a strange way of putting it , but think of it as a perfume that feels good going on your skin the smell is really floral and feminine it 's quite beautiful and relaxing i was surprised at the quality of the bottle it feels like sturdy glass it would make for a lovely addition to a spa themed bridal gift or mother 's day gift ! anyone that could use some pampering
4	i found the texture of obagi professional c to be between a serum and a very lightweight cream it went on smoothly and the coverage was just right with three pumps it is almost scent free but there is a tiny whisper of a citrus scent after it had absorbed into my skin , i felt a slight tingle , noting big but there was definitely a reaction it left my skin feeling smooth without any tightness i ca n't speak to long term use on wrinkle appearance , it 's only been a week the container is very small so be sure you take the size into account when purchasing
4	i have colored thick hair that is below shoulder length i used about 2 of this and washed my hair from the ends up this does not lather but it smells great as i rinsed my hair i noticed i did have my large comb in the shower i was able to run my fingers through my hair including the parts that get most tangled with minimal effort i have never been able to do that in my entire life \( when i was little , my mom used to cut my hair because it would get so tangled \) i normally go a week between washings and i can tell i 'll be able to go that long with this after one use , my hair feels healthier and more manageable it 's easier to use the wet brush on it during the day and it has remained tangle free i deducted one star because of the price as at this point in my life , i would not consider spending 44 for shampoo if cost is not a factor for you , i definitely recommend this product if your hair is colored or long or thick
5	muy bueno
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i love this color wore through recent holidays and it was just great many compliments thank you so very much
5	i ca n't begin to how much money i have spent on mascara , though i am sure if i did my hubby would have a of and tubes upon tubes from drugstore brands like covergirl and physician 's formula to mid line brands like and to uber expensive brands like armani and dior stila used to make a mascara that was my hg , but they discontinued it and broke my heart because none of their other formulas are as good i 've been mixing and matching brands since then , like pairing maybelline soft as the first coat and full with tarte 's lights , camera , lashes as the second to get long , full , thick lashes though still not as perfect as they were with stila 's mascara i am always game to try a new mascara in the hopes that it will be like the stila stay all day mascara i loved it 's a week in and i am beyond thrilled with this mascara so far , this has come the absolute closest to what the stila formula was like it does n't dry out my lashes , it does n't irritate my eyes , my lashes look like i'm wearing , and best of all it says put when applying it goes on cleanly without clumping or sticking your lashes together i did n't even need to use a lash comb or curler two coats lasted me all day with zero flaking or smudging even when i was in a dusty big box store and rubbed both my eyes pretty hard i pulled a tissue out of my purse to clean up under my eyes because i was positive i now looked like a raccoon , but nothing was there i checked my eyes when i got back into the car , and again , nothing the mascara stayed put there was n't any irritation or crunch to my lashes they felt like they were bare even though i knew they had mascara on them that night it took a bit of effort to remove with makeup remover as face soap and water did n't take all of it off the price of this mascara is a bit cringe worthy , but la roche posay is n't exactly a cheap brand i love their skincare , especially the line for acne as it cleared my skin without causing drying or flaking like prescription meds did if la roche posay is out into a full makeup line , i ca n't wait to see what they come out with next maybe if they produce other items they will lower the price a little my stila mascara was 18 a tube , and tarte is usually 19 21 a tube , though paying that much still is n't something i like to do there are cheaper drugstore brands that work pretty well , but even the waterproof ones tend to migrate and end up under my eyes mascara tends to be one of those things where you get what you pay for i 'd rather buy one tube for 25 and know that i will use it day after day after day \( until i hit the three month toss \) instead of multiple cheap mascaras that i end up using only a handful of times because it just does n't live up to its marketing hype this mascara is worth the price tag because i know i will use it exclusively until i need to purchase a new tube
4	this mask helped tone my uneven undertones i felt pale after using it a few times and did n't continue however , the quality of this product and ingredients lead me to giving it four stars as some people may use it for different reasons that i intended everyone 's skin is different !
4	i am always a fan of using oil on my face , it is very moisturizing and actually prevents breakouts however i have cut back on using oil as my pores were looking clogged i do miss it in winter so i was excited to try this product as it is a mixture of oil and anti aging ingredients the oil is nice but i do not like the dropper mechanism more oil comes out than i need for each use it is a bit greasy since it is oil but if you use the right amount it does n't take too long to absorb i only use this at night with the wrinkle smoothing capsules i think my skin looks more vibrant , too soon to tell about the wrinkles but at least they are n't worse even though i have been stressed and sleep deprived for the last couple of months so if trump gets soon , i may start to look younger
4	good toothpaste but way more mint than ginger flavored that was a little disappointing , as the other marvis flavors i have tried are n't that way especially jasmine mint which is much more jasmine y was looking for more ginger flavor but marvis is still a great product and even though it 's more of a fun novelty product for my household , it gives you a clean tasting mouth and performs well \( hence 4 stars \)
5	this is a great item it uses small batteries to provide a very smooth trim of your facial hair now , this is the thing when i purchased another kind of trimmer it did not cut , but this item does not do that at all it cuts like crazy and that is great because it makes it a very smooth cut get it and enjoy trimming your ears \( and avoiding looking like an old man \)
5	now that i am retired , i have time to enjoy the beautiful sunshine florida has to offer i am not a sun , but i love being outside playing with my we spend a lot of time exploring the theme and we are not able to always find shade this sunscreen went on with ease and helped keep my face from getting burned very nice and thick , rubbed in easily and felt like it worked well throughout the day no awful scent and perfect for my sensitive skin !
5	this product works so well as long as you use the scrub fresh and the top coat , per the directions , this polish will last at least a week with no chipping !
5	the fine lines and puffiness under my eyes have all but vanished !
4	my wife and i have tried this in the past and it was great so we 're having another go at it we spend a lot of time in the sun , , traveling , etc we have sensitive skin and it 's important to take care of it our skin feels so much better and healthy after using juice beauty it 's smooth , light , and does n't leave any stinging or weird effects my recommendation is to apply in the morning after showering and whatnot with this method the bottle could probably last two to three months it 's a pretty good value
5	i 've loved la roche posay sunscreens for years they really are the best on the market but lately i 've gotten large samples of some of their other products and , it 's working , they 're making a convert of me i 've always used a combination of clarins , lancome and guerlain for skincare , and i 've saved laroche for sun protection , but this cleanser is every bit as good as the 40 foaming cleanser i 've been using for years it feels very mild on my skin , but at the same time it cuts right through makeup and daily dirt and oil even though it 's gentle it has no problem dealing with the serious dirt on my skin after a day of grooming and riding horses \( and out \) the thing that really sold me on this \( and i give very few five star reviews ! \) is that after i use it my skin feels soft , not stripped for me , that 's the most important thing , because what good is having clean skin if it feels like its going to crack off before you can reach for the moisturizer \? if this was available on subscribe save i 'd buy it automatically this is my new regular cleanser
4	butter london is a very well known brand i have tried their blush and nail colors and have been very pleased the mascara is an interesting product the traditional wand has a ball on the end , it does make applying the mascara easier , and does not clump the mascara is jet black , and for my aging lashes did define and separate my lashes i ca n't really see that it lengthens my lashes , but because my lashes are thinner than they used to be , it does provide some volume the directions are and easy to follow apply to lashes using the center part of the mascara wand pull the bristles through the lashes in a motion to coat each lash use the tip of the wand to lengthen and define the mascara does apply very evenly , and i liked the application for my use the mascara did not smudge , and i used it during a 90 degree day and went out to complete some errands my face was moist and no signs of smudging i think this was an excellent test i tend to tear easily and that is the greatest test for mascaras , it did not run nor smear my use of mascara is usually limited for night time events , and i will certainly use this again the one issue i have is that you have to force to get the ball end if the wand in and out of the mascara a small issue , but an irritating one recommended prisrob 07 26 16
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	love it came fast to will buy more
4	this has a purplish , burgundy , brownish colour it is a nice variation from red and nude colours it is one of the cnd family so why not own it \? \) this is a darker color than red baroness i do n't remember it having any sparkle whereas red baroness has a faint sparkle it is a great cnd family member to wear when your and serious
5	it 's fun it 's great for spring or summer
5	yum high end lotion not too thick or thin smells fine , and i love the ingredients it helps my son with his eczema highly recommended
4	the tone of this blush is a bright , rose pink , probably most appropriate for cool skin tones it has no orange or gold undertones to it , making it a true pink it is fairly fine milled , so it goes on smoothly , but unlike some of my other finely milled face powders and blushes \( hourglass in particular \) it does n't seem to have the staying power after it 's applied i noticed that after work \( 8 hours from application more or less \) i had almost no blush on my face i'm not a face , so i have to chalk this up to the blush itself i also noticed that it tended to cling to dry areas , so the first time i applied it i actually ended up putting another layer of moisturizer on my face , then reapplying my foundation and blending it out before reapplying the blush this may be an effect of its pore minimizing feature , but i do n't prefer it , as my cheekbones do n't really have large pores i have larger pores along my t zone , where i would never apply blush i have no idea how this as anti aging that seems to be purely on as a to the trend it is a fairly bright , youthful pink , so maybe that 's it \? the box that it comes in is gorgeous i love the shiny black compact and the generously sized mirror it also closes securely !
5	i 've used moisturizers before and i try to take care of my skin and while i thought those were good , baxter 's night cream was much better than anything i 've used it is a thick cream texture , is n't greasy and a little goes a long way i use a 3 8 squeeze from the tube , which is enough to cover my face it absorbs quickly and well , so i can go about my business and not get anything on my pillow i either ca n't detect anything but a light scent or there is none added , so it has a very light to no scent my skin is on the oily side and i noticed that it was a little less oily after a week of use i'm sure it has more to do with the aha , but my skin looks better i think so and others have noticed as well my skin is even and just looks better , healthy people mostly commented like most baxter products , this is a good quality and will last longer due to using less so while some might look at the cost and think twice , it is actually a pretty good value
4	living in the bay area of california for a time , my wife i were always by the smell of jasmine in the air it seemed to be everywhere and we always loved the fragrance this perfume has those same notes layered with orange and a touch of rose best of all , it is not over powering yet it lasts and lasts great stocking stuffer or a gift for any occasion
4	i have used this 2 nights in a row so far , and noticed a difference after the first use the arctic winter air is causing my skin to dry , and this is really helping rehydrate it i also notice a reduction in the size of my pores my only complaint is that it is easy to get too much dispensed , which leaves your skin oily all in all a good product though
5	i use this with uv light and the base top coat from cnd looks and holds like the shellacks i get at the salon
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	said it before , will say it again fantastic liner for eyes smoke is a great color nice smudging effect buy them they really work
3	i'm relatively familiar with mario badescu products , i last used them about 11 years ago i was eager to try this lotion , and for the most part , i do really like it i love the way it feels , i think it really helps with dryness and the scaly , chapped feeling skin on my elbows what i am not fond of is the of the packaging the plastic coating of the label came off immediately and the smell it has kind of an old lady smell to it , not so much the fresh and clean that the description boasts however , i can deal with the smell for the way it feels on the skin
5	great color
5	great top coat
2	for the price you receive a substantial amount of cologne and a nice looking bottle this was not what i was expecting , of course i got this with my husband in mind but i first tried it out myself my first opinion was that it was very strong and the smell did not dissipate , i was not impressed with the scent at all it reminded me of someone smoking or a pipe i thought maybe i just do n't have taste and that this stuff smells awesome but something was wrong with me unfortunately my husband also did not like it , when he smelled it he got a little on his beard and it stayed on there for hours and he kept commenting throughout the day that he could still smell it we let a couple of our friends smell it and they too did not like the scent i see most of the reviews saying how great this smells and i wish it smelled that good to us as well
5	this is a review of la roche posay micellar cleansing water and makeup remover for sensitive skin nice light scent and very effective at removing dirt and oil from my face even after getting out of the shower and using this on my just washed face , it removed more oil and dirt enough to cause the cotton pad to become visibly dirty this is great to use on those round or shaped cotton pads cotton balls will work too but not as well my wife thinks it 's great at removing her makeup too
5	covers roots really nicely it stays on all day some touch up the next day i have medium brown hair i ordered the light brown looks really good !
5	excelente
4	nice tinted bb cream light and blends well it has subtle coverage and left a semi matte finish on my skin which i love i did not however care for the scent why cosmetic companies put fragrance in their products is a mystery to me i would recommend this product except for the price i feel there are plenty of drug store alternatives for less
3	this product is not working as well for me and my long , straight hair i mostly wear my hair pinned back , but my bangs usually need some extra \( especially when they 've been slept on \) , and i was hoping this might do the trick the product is a bit heavy and waxy out of the jar , and i did n't notice any strong odor \( a plus for me \) , but it was a bit heavy on my bangs and dragged them down definitely not a product made for me , especially in that price range i can see from other reviewers this product could work very well for those with shorter hair and looking for a dramatic effect to tame that morning after hair your mileage may vary
3	this concealer works better over the foundation , at least in my experience most concealers are applied under the foundation to hide imperfections , this one is too liquid for that the first time i tried it i was disappointed because it get absorbed by my skin and it is as if i hadnt applied anything so , i decided to try after having applied my foundation to cover the still visible imperfections , and then it works it blends nicely with it , and it is small and lightweight to carry it in my purse basically , im using it for retouch while im out of the house
5	great product
2	this 2 inch iron is enormous , as compared to other irons wands i was hoping it would work great for either huge curls , loose wave curves , or for adding body to the very top of my head it did n't work for any of those for me bc i think it 's just too big to make anything really happen with the hair other than sort of straighten iron it with a very slight curve my hair is down to my waist too , so i did have plenty of length to try it on but it just did n't work at all for me bummer , bc it looked so fun cool to do different things !
5	lovely scent and formula
5	before using cnd , i 'd have my nails done once a month with gel now , i do them myself , it lasts up to 3 weeks , does n't usually chip , depending how rough i get with them yes , once in a while , i have one break , but it 's usually , when i should 've them and did n't it really does go on like polish and soaks off in minutes ! yes , it costs a bit more then regular polish , but lasts much longer and way cheaper then going to the salon
5	ordering a tinted moisturizer from a brand i 'd never used before i was n't sure if the color would work for me golden says it 's for light to medium and i'm definitely on the light end of the scale \( is my color in clinique \) , so i was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be the right color i'm sure it helps that this is a tinted moisturizer rather than a foundation and that the color is buildable i only did one application to have the right color i found the coverage to be closer to a foundation than other tinted moisturizers and it feels nice on not too heavy
5	hands down the best shampoo it leaves my hair clean without over drying it !
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	been using this image vital c mask for years and i'm still loving it just as i did when i first learned of this fabulous line works great and really does what it 's suppose to sometimes i leave on for an hr and once a month i leave it on over night while i'm asleep and the results are amazing
4	this is a nice little blush it is very creamy so it really needs to be applied with your fingertip or when it gets down to the bottom of the case a q tip will work it is described for cheeks , face or lips however when i applied it to my lips it looked chalky and unnatural on the face it was fine , but it did look less natural than the same brand 's mineral powder blush it is very tiny just about 1 , so it is pricy the case can be connected to other items from the same company
5	heats up fast and gets extremely hot this is perfect for the loose curls that are popular right now wrap hair around it and voila ! this is salon quality at home there is a bit of a learning curve with a rod iron , but once you get the hang of it you 'll be curling curling curling
4	i did n't expect to like this , thinking it was just another basic moisturizer \( but with organic ingredients \) but color me impressed shea butter is the 2nd ingredient after the juices because of this , the texture is actually a delight imagine shea butter diluted down to an emulsion , creating a thin , flexible , protective film on your face that acts as a barrier primer it has that matte drydown often found in shea , but is much thinner and lighter the slight firming sensation acts as a temporary freeze while filling in pores and fine lines amazingly , i found it effective as a wind chafing barrier , my face from the cold i love that it is non oily in texture , allowing me to layer stuff over it no pilling at all compatible with your other serums sunscreens foundations now , a moisturizer that simply hydrates is not good enough ! we demand more from our products these days to show truly results , this cream has to do something else that 's where the aha 's come in the fruit acids to act as low level aha 's \( i 'd guess it 's 5 or less \) , so you wo n't see visible brightness overnight but over a few weeks , you 'll feel your skin texture getting smoother , more refined the aha 's are crucial in this product because without them , your dead skin cells would just accumulate , and the lipid ingredients in this cream would simply bind those dead cells together , causing dullness and clogs also it is silicone free \( silicone is notorious for causing clogs \) , and it has other good for you nutrients like antioxidants and dmae but really it 's the aha 's that do the most in summary , this formulation is a good combo of light aha 's and hydrating ingredients while clear of the no no s if you are looking for an immediate refining brightening effect , only a professional peel or ipl laser treatment would do that i 'd recommend this cream as a good maintenance cream that gradually further refines skin on a slower basis , albeit much gentler
3	this is straight up black mascara i did n't notice anything special about it it is not waterproof , and comes off easily with standard makeup remover , which is fine with me nowadays there are so many gimmicks with mascara i was expecting something more for the price
5	i love this one ! i just used this one with the violet pearl faded in and so far it is my favorite very spring !
5	works surprisingly well
3	i found this lip color very close to what it looks like on the picture a nice soft hue the feel of it was a bit too chalky and clumpy for my liking however , the color stayed on for most of the day , which was helpful it 's a decent product but overpriced \( currently 20 on amazon \) i think there are better lip conditioners and glosses out there that last longer and that go on much smoother \( i like sephora 's line , personally \)
5	i use this serum along with the gel moisturizer i'm 35 so i do n't have many wrinkles but nonetheless this serum gives my skin radiance it also helps with the oiliness of my skin description says it 's oil free but upon arrival i saw castor oil in the ingredient list and thought \? well apparently castor oil is really good for oily skin i love the price , too not too much more than drugstore brands well worth your money
4	this come is firmer and crisper in use than are the more typical molded plastic combs it has a cool old school look and feel to it how important is that \? hard to say , because my hair looks the same after i use this or a cheaper alternative
1	product received promptly in a well cushioned envelope however quality of nail polish leads me to believe it is either extremely old or had been sitting for a long period of time in extreme temperatures nail polish is extremely watery , not at all glossy even after 3 coats it is not the quality i am used to when compared to other essie nail polishes
4	this conditioner makes your hair soft , shiny and manageable i can use any shampoo with it and the result is always the same i would purchase this conditioner again in the future i gave 4 star because i had this bottle before and if you drop it the cap will crack
5	perfect red for me
5	i have never used a la roche posay product before and i am really impressed this foundation went on so smooth it felt silky as i applied it to my face i was impressed with the coverage because it feels so light on my skin i like the mattifying effect because i tend to have oily , shiny skin
4	i know what you 're thinking because i was thinking it too 50 for soap \? ! if you 're in a budget crunch i would definitely say to pass on this , but if you have the means , this is some top end bath gel smells great , lathers well and washes clean will last a really long time worth it in my opinion
4	i liked it but its not hg i like that its glycerin based which is different i do n't really like the feel of it on my lips or skin kind of a waxy silicone feel but it does moisturize well overall consensus is that it 's way too expensive in america and therefore even though i put i would repurchase , i would only do so for the original price oh yes and the smell disappears quickly as stated
2	chalky pencil not smooth on the eye the color is not a saturated tone
3	this feels nice , and it can be worn well under makeup but it does n't seem to do anything for me it 's lightweight and goes on nicely , and obagi is a good brand \( we 're big fans of the clenziderm line in my household \) but this was sort of meh
5	great seller , received on time great color , last 2 weeks
4	i have ruddy , red skin from years of plucking and waxing hair off of my neck i used a silicone applicator to put this on it is green at first but quickly blends in and helps tone down the redness quite a bit it also feels very light , so it is great for those of us who do not like to wear foundation or makeup at all i worked out at the gym wearing it and it did not smear or run
4	i saw kylie jenner use this on snap and i when i looked it up i was surprised at how low the price was it smells like alcohol , but works well i use it at bedtime do n't shake it ! ! seems like this little bottle will last me a long time
4	this product comes in a stylish , attractive package that pumps well you need only two pumps , so it should last a while i like the invigorating scent , and the product has n't caused any skin issues it made my skin feel good and moisturized not sure about the skin energising claims , but it 's worth a try if you can afford it
3	this grooming lotion does n't seem to do very much it smells and feels pleasant when applied , with a very light barbershop scent that fades quickly , and vanishes into post shower hair quickly after that , it seems to work like a light conditioner , nothing more the hair is maybe a little more and a little heavier , but does n't have any significant texture or hold at all it 's not much of a hair product as far as i can tell more like a post wash conditioner , which is pleasant but does n't have enough of an effect to justify the price i 'd stick with baxter 's \( or other brands' \) various pomades instead
5	wife says i have thick , curly , wavy and medium length hair and man ! this product worked ! i absolutely loved this gel , small in size , but very effective do read the usage direction and it will be easy to use my hair stayed exactly in place the entire day , on a warm humid day , and i looked so fresh , as the gel gave my hair a look of freshness it was very easy to come off both from the hands and the hair just a wash \( no soap shampoo needed \) was enough i ca n't say if my hair felt drier after using this , as i am yet to use it enough number of times so far , i 've loved this product and can count on it during my travel
4	i have sensitive , redness prone combo skin and have been experiencing several breakouts over the past few years \( i got through high school and college just fine but it seems adult acne has claimed another \) my breakouts are pretty minor comparatively but this has helped tremendously with everything except for the cystic spots for blackheads and whiteheads , this generally clear them up in a day or two i do experience some lingering redness if i use it as directed \( several times a day \) so if you have sensitive or dry skin i would recommend you do n't go to heavy handed with the application with the cystic spots i have n't noticed any real improvement it 's a very harsh drying product so i just get more redness and flaking in the area it 's a bit pricey but regardless , it 's well worth it if you can catch a pimple early enough this can stop it dead in its tracks i like to layer it along with a few other products such as mario badescu 's buffering lotion , hydrocortisone cream \( which helps cut down on redness and swelling \) the whole effaclar line has proved very effective and gentle overall \( with the exception of this product as it is definitely not gentle \)
5	i 'd been dying for this color from the day i saw it on the essie site , and for anyone who 's been on there you 'll know it 's been sold out for months ! finally i found it on amazon and i nearly cried it 's the most perfect pink and definitely a must have nail polish color no matter the season , hot pink is always in style , and it 's absolutely perfect for nights out ! it makes me feel ten times hotter when i'm shaking it in the club and my glowing pink tipped nails catch the flashing lights definitely buy this color ! ! ! you need it i swear
5	product was as described
5	love it came fast to will buy more
4	i 've been using similar products for years and the first thing i noticed was the jar is smaller than most others in this price range my usual go to was 4 2 oz and this is only 1 7 which is small for 20 that being said , for the length of my hair \( fairly short \) i only need to use a pea size amount so it should still get some mileage out of this jar i rub it between my hands and apply to my hair while still wet and then blow dry it as i style i usually go back with just a tad extra and spot style a few places it rinses out easily with shampoo and does n't seem to leave any residue overall if you are a fan of vaughn and the hair his products have ended up in and do n't mind the small size , you wo n't be disappointed , it does offer a good texture and hold minus one star though for the small quantity size
3	the candle itself is beautiful right out of the box lit , it 's stunning but as for scent throw \? there is n't one for the price i expected to be blown away
5	this is not only a great setting mist , it 's also an awesome sunscreen i use it because the florida sun is and i need a good sunscreen every day i hate the greasiness of most high spf lotions and they do n't work well under makeup when you have oily skin like i do so this spray spf 50 mist is the perfect solution i have worn it when riding and it 's worked like a charm i 've also used it during outdoor events and i 've never had even a hint of sunburn i use it daily to set my makeup and it 's been a true at keeping my face fresh even as the heat and humidity i have used it for about 6 months in all kinds of situations and it 's always worked perfectly when riding the bike , i keep it in my backpack and reapply every few hours i do the same thing at any outdoor event however , just one spritz is all i need for any regular day it can sting a little when it first goes on , which is not uncomfortable , so be sure to keep your eyes closed but it dries almost instantly it 's far superior to any sunscreen lotion , especially if you have oily or combination skin i highly recommend it for all skin types and i have repeatedly purchased the large bottle at sephora there 's simply nothing better than this two in one product
5	love the color
5	i am a tremendous vichy product fan i already love and own all of the 4 products in this set they come in a pretty tin which is easily mine is now working as a jewelry box it 's a substantial tin , too the products include a toner style face wash , a facial serum , a face cream and a body lotion they all have a lovely light scent which i find very pleasing these are terrific products for sensitive skin the sample sizes are sufficient to discover if these products are for you i particularly like the serum but they all complement one another excellent to value and no junk products here every one is a winner
5	great product , great price , fast shipping !
2	i love wearing makeup and are always trying new products in the market i had tried other cream eyeshadows before and they seemed to disappear in a just a few hours i had hoped that the marketplace had a longer lasting eyeshadow and i thought that with the high price that this might be it i was completely disappointed in that the eyeshadow lasted less than a couple of hours the color was beautiful and if you are only going out for a very short time you might want to consider this eyeshadow although the price is way too high i cannot recommend this product as it does not last and it is very expensive the only thing was that the color was very pretty
5	normally , i do n't prefer too much of a scent on my man usually , a little cologne if we go out is all he needs when i first saw this biagiotti gel i hesitated but , being how i am headed back to italy \( rome \) in may , i was into getting this and , how pleasantly surprised i was my man loves the gel , foams up nice in the shower and he feels fresh and clean after using it and , i , who was n't sure why i was even taking this , was pleasantly surprised how good he smells just getting out of the shower not perfumey at all , and very masculine i really love this roma uomo scent and i would recommend it for every day use for the man in your life
3	i received a small sample bottle of this serum for testing the results i had were mainly positive , i get scratchy skin on occasion and when i put it on the spot i was itching the relief was immediate and lasted i do n't notice any strong scent \( a plus for me \) , and it goes on easily and fairly little is needed for a full application it feels like on my skin and not heavy like some other skin products can be why only three stars \? while i do like this product a lot , at 90 that 's a breaking point for me , but your mileage may vary
5	use it with oribe hair mask \( use it as conditioner \) omg ! it makes my frizzy hair just like normal 's
4	i picked this product up for my teenage daughter to use she has used it for a few weeks now and here are her thoughts i regularly use this product one thing that i find a little surprising is that it is extremely watery , which means that you must use a little bit of the remover on a cotton pad in order to remove the makeup does not leave my skin overly oily after use , although i always wash my face afterwards just to make sure it is all gone i usually prefer lotion like makeup removers but this product works very well and comes in a huge quantity
5	i am very pale and i thought this color might be too dark not true ! i think it looks very nice , especially for evening wear it creates a warm drama for me and i really like the color and consistency i applied this with a make up sponge which gave me very smooth flawless color without streaks i 'd probably not use it for day wear but i have a lot of events coming up and this will be part of my front line makeup approach it feels good , has decent staying power and goes well with my foundation very nice find , had not used this company 's products before
5	fun shade and opi is always the best
5	since the polish last a week , i prefer a polish that is a colored neutral , nothing flashy this can be worn with many shades of green and even some blue colors in my wardrobe definitely recommend the top coat this particular color most definitely be a color to have on hand cannot say enough good things about the vinylux polish wearing other polish never lasted more than one or two days very rough on polish , however vinylux holds up my polish always looks good love it !
5	spring has with juicy la la malibu love the scent it is light and airy and not overpowering i use different scents all the time depending on my mood this scent is uplifting and lovely , crisp and clean a definite buy
4	you get what you pay for
5	beautiful for fall
5	i wore this crme blush the day after i received it and i love it it is very soft and light and applies smoothly the blush adds a sort of glow to the skin tone and the blush itself is sheer i have the rose gold which is perfect for my pale complexion the best way to apply the blush , in my opinion , is to just use your fingers just be sure you wash your hands first then lightly pat the blush onto your cheek , especially the apple of the cheek the shade may seem bright but , if you just keep patting it , the color will soften into a natural glow super easy to apply and long lasting definitely my new favorite and the only blush ill be taking with me on my next trip
5	i really like this cleansing gel it cleans my face well , and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth with winter coming on with a bang , and the furnace running like crazy , i appreciate that it does n't dry my skin i'm not one for scented products , but the scent of this is nice and not very strong , and i do n't mind it i do n't mind the price for this product , i only need a little bit to wash my whole face , and this bottle should last quite a while , so it 's a better value than you would think
5	great moisturizer
5	while it is expensive , it 's the only sunscreen i 've used that feels more like moisturizer than sunscreen not greasy at all great for wearing under makeup i 'd been looking for a light face sunscreen for a while , and tried so many drugstore and department store brand this one is definitely the best i will say that you do n't have to use a lot of it for full facial coverage , and the size has lasted me a while
5	my wife loves this product ! i used this with the obagi eye brightener and the results were immediate my skin was firm and my lines were smoothed i was pleasantly surprised , because im pretty skeptical about skin care most products can improve the appearance of your skin a little , but this and the brightener were amazing ive never used a peptide product , so i really do n't have experience to draw from i just know that this improved the look and feel of my skin instantly love it , and will keep using it for sure !
5	this is great ! i could n't live without it , my friend told me to try it cuz u was upset that i'm losing hair at a young age and being a woman i use it after i wash and dry my hair i keep it in my purse love it
5	this great for nail art ! ! love it
3	this is the first time i am trying out h20 products i must admit this lathers well and smells nice eucalyptus scent but the scent goes away once you wash off the shampoo the shampoo is thick greenish color it does clean hair rather nicely and keeps it manageable after drying the hair the flip open shampoo dispenser works well having said , the cost factor weighs the overall rating down as for mere us 12 oz the price seem too steep and me to rate it with 3 stars , otherwise i would have given it i like it rating easily on the plus side as couple of drops are enough to get a good smelling shampoo experience everyday so , this bottle might last couple of months for me
1	does n't smell good burns and makes skin angry would not recommend
4	this is a great but somewhat spendy sunscreen the spf is sixty and it stays on in water for forty minutes it works well in both adults and children and for those with sensitive skin as it is oil free , fragrance free and allergy tested this sunscreen goes on easily and feel very pleasant on the skin other than the price i am delighted with this sunscreen
4	slightly purple off color in some lighting sticks better than caboki but the color made me stop buying it
5	great color and in certain light looks black
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
5	this as a pleasant surprise this was a new brand to her , and the scent was just about perfect pleasing but not cloying , noticeable but still quite subtle so many other similar products are a bit , when you get in range of the scent it 's like you walked through a wall this is quite the opposite , and she loves the smell
5	i wished l'occitane was n't so pricey , but their shea butter products are really fabulous the hand cream is rich and moisturizing
5	this is great stuff i purchased it after i started using the acne starter kit and really like it it 's a serum that is used for problem areas only the serum is a bit sticky so i use it before i go to bed so that it works during the night it helps with redness and i noticed that when i feel swelling or inflammation , with a blemish that has n't reached the surface yet , it reduces the tenderness and redness which i love when i use it at night it takes the tenderness away and i can see that the blemish does n't come up if i have some inflammation in the morning i will apply a small amount on the problem area under my makeup like i said it has a bit of a sticky texture but it does n't get to sticky if you use a small amount under makeup overall great product
5	i love the vinylux polishes they definitely have lasting power ! ! ! i wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day i put it on ! the vinylux lasts about a week for me , which is amazing some of the polishes are a little clumpy like they are a little old but it 's ok decent price too !
5	came fast and is really pretty
3	i typically use oil cleansing to remove makeup , and this just does not compare especially in removing mascara i had to tug and rub at my eyes quite a bit to get my eye makeup off overall , not worth the hype
5	i 've been a big fan of dermablend 's products , and this powder is no exception i'm really impressed by its coverage no need to carry around foundation in my purse for mid day touch ups anymore the color was a little lighter than expected , but i'm generally pleased with dermablend 's range of colors i definitely recommend you try out their products , especially if you have skin issues
5	love this color on ! ! ! great spring summer hue , and been an addiction to pair it up with essie 's matte about you topcoat ! ! ! great price , shipping time is quick , and great addition to my essie polish collection ! ! !
5	cnd shellac sugared spice is an excellent neutral once applied it is lighter than the picture shows i was hoping for a brown , but received a beautiful neutral tan which i like anyway i am a do it your and it applies great it is opaque as i find the non opaque shellacs impossible to apply without streaks even after 3 coats
5	i am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked ! every product i 've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective with a great price ! i 've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out i'm a very happy customer this product is wonderful for my sometimes dry skin
4	thanks !
5	well i like it its got a clean citrus scent that 's rather pleasing lasts all day and that 's what you want in a aftershave cologne recommended
5	i loved the color , i love the brand that last for a week at least and the service was great
1	terrible product does n't hide any thin spots only makes your hair feel like straw and look dull
4	love this color ! i layer it over strawberry smoothie and it creates such a pretty , natural color it 's great for me as a busy mom , because the outgrowth does n't look as bad as maybe a gray color would i can get away with putting off doing my nails a little longer when i do the strawberry smoothie with two coats of this over ! the picture shows of outgrowth ! came brand new and as described !
1	wow , i smell like grandma with this perfume this smells very sweet and flowery and not very sexy or modern at all i have to admit that i will discard the remainder of this product the container and sticker emblem was pretty looking too
3	first , what this is n't it is n't a moisturizer or a foundation it goes on after moisturizer and before foundation , and promises to provide a canvas for your makeup , to fill in fine lines and pores it does feel wonderful and silky going on i think that is probably due to the silica gel it did n't fill in my fine lines , but at my age , i think i probably need a smooth coat of spackle however , my foundation did go on nice and evenly , and did n't get blotchy however , the difference it made seemed minimal compared to my normal make up routine water is the first ingredient , although the package calls it there are several ingredients i cannot pronounce and that do n't sound especially like things i want on my face the tube contains only 0 88 ounce at the over 40 price tag at the time i reviewed this product , it seems the is , and the product just is n't worth it to me
5	rich and beautiful color
4	this product is slightly darker than most of the 01 foundations and concealers i own , especially the ones i tend to use in winter i am usually a bit darker in the summer , and i suspect this color will work just fine then it goes on well , and seems to wear well it blends well it removes well it 's a good concealer it has a nice consistency i would give it five stars if it were slightly lighter
3	strivectinlabs facial toner is a bit pricey for 200 plus tax via amazon prime i 've been using for around two weeks and have not seen any visible facial improvements there are facial one can do to keep your face and neck toned as you age i would call this a fountain of youth item the vibration is a relaxing feeling it only comes with 6 pads you can use the pads longer than they say make sure your face is clean before using as long as pads stay sticky and you the feel the same current strivectinlabs facial toner gel pads cost 20 bucks for 6 via amazon prime shipping if i notice any truly noticeable changes , i will update i still believe the cost is overpriced
5	i love essie polishes essie products are very consistent in the quality it goes on smoothly and dries very fast
5	i am very happy with the quality of the polish and the color is simply beautiful on my tanned feet
4	this is a nice , soft finish , finely milled powder that performs well and is somewhat forgiving in terms of shade it 's non irritating to my sensitive skin and offers a good setting powder option for use with dermablend cream products i have no issue with this product , but i do n't see where or how it stands out from other powders i frankly like my almay powder just as much , even though it 's far less expensive \( and attempts far less in it 's color choices \) however , where this one stands out is in it 's darker color range , as there is certainly offers more options than many other lines still , i find there 's enough transparency to these powders \( i 've worked with several shades on several different people \) to allow several workable shade options for most people this is not an exact skin match powder as for all the colors i have tried , all the amazon product images look lighter than the actual products , so when in doubt go for a lighter color many of the darker shades lean a bit orange and the tend cooler it 's a good powder and i will continue to use it but i wo n't repurchase because it did n't distinguish itself enough from other products , and though the shade range seems large , there 's not an exact match and although i do n't demand much coverage from a setting powder , it should be noted that the coverage level was a bit less than anticipated given the reputation of this brand
5	if you 're familiar with 's book the skin type solution , this is one of the face washes she recommends for oily skin since i also have sensitive skin \( my skin type is \) , i was worried that it would be too drying for me , but i really do like this ! the foaming action is definitely more subtle than other foaming cleansers i 've used , but it suds up nicely and has a light , pleasant scent that is non irritating since it contains salicylic acid , it 's designed for oily and acne prone skin i do n't have acne \( just the occasional pimple \) , but do have that classic oily t zone , and this seems to help reduce the shine what i also like about this is that it is excellent at removing makeup when i wipe a cotton pad with toner over my face after cleansing with this , no makeup residue is left on the cotton pad since i am worried about this being too drying , especially as winter approaches , i will probably save this for nighttime use since it does an excellent job at removing makeup , and use something a bit less drying in the mornings i can also see this tube lasting a really long time since you only need a small amount of product to wash your whole face the price is high , but i will definitely re purchase it when i run out since it works so well
4	this is a gorgeous palette for bronzing and getting that sunkissed look i have a medium tan complexion and i found that the colors worked great for me the sun shadow taupe is great for contouring the sun kissed color is perfect for that natural tanned look the bronzer should be used sparingly i love the gold highlighter however , there 's so little of it that i know it will run out quickly because everything is in powder form , i find that it does not last throughout the day so reapplication is needed for that reason i do prefer blendable cream or stick products
5	this is great stuff i purchased it after i started using the acne starter kit and really like it it 's a serum that is used for problem areas only the serum is a bit sticky so i use it before i go to bed so that it works during the night it helps with redness and i noticed that when i feel swelling or inflammation , with a blemish that has n't reached the surface yet , it reduces the tenderness and redness which i love when i use it at night it takes the tenderness away and i can see that the blemish does n't come up if i have some inflammation in the morning i will apply a small amount on the problem area under my makeup like i said it has a bit of a sticky texture but it does n't get to sticky if you use a small amount under makeup overall great product
4	with virtually all of the anti aging products i 've tried , i can say for sure there has been no lasting effect \( beyond the instant improvement any dry skin gets from any hydration \) in contrast , i'm pretty sure this has had a very mild but effect on my crow 's feet i used the entire bottle , which lasted about 5 weeks , one pump twice daily i applied first to my eyes , then spread the remainder to the rest of my face as directed , after it dried , i followed with my usual moisturizer \( in this case , a revitalift product that i 'd used and knew was having no real anti aging benefits , but is an effective moisturizer \) after about 3 weeks , i started to think i might be seeing an effect , and by the end of the bottle , i had n't talked myself out of it i know that 's not a endorsement , but compared to my typical impressions of so called anti aging products , it 's significant it 's easy to apply \( tiny pump bottle i always feel like i'm being out of a couple applications with a pump , though it protects the product from contamination \) , absorbs and dries quickly i would apply it , brush my teeth , and it would always be completely dry and ready for moisturizer i have one mirror with natural light that is particularly unflattering and always makes me feel like a when i catch my reflection after the full bottle , i look marginally less ancient considering that 's just 5 6 weeks , not too but considering it 's 59 and a tiny bottle , and would cost me north of 500 a year to use continuously , unfortunately too much for me to extend my experiment my info 47 with pretty good skin and average crow 's feet and expression lines not prone to breakouts very dry skin in winter , dry enough to need moisturizer twice daily year round my skincare routine is washing with plain water moisturizer am pm , sunscreen if i will be outside at all , including longer drives sometimes i add a targeted serum or eye cream to the mix , but i rely on keeping my routine very basic \( or i wo n't keep it up \)
5	i was thrilled to find this blush on amazon , since i ca n't find it where i now live the powder is fine and light , with very good pigmentation it goes on evenly and lasts about as long as any powder blush usually does i find the color \( fair skin , blue undertones , copper hair \) mimics the perfect flush for me i 'll keep buying this as long as they make it , and probably stock up if it gets discontinued
4	i love the darker color , streak free , but does not last long only a few days make sure you use a mitt with this tanner
3	i got it to cover some redness and bruising i do n't think it worked very well for that i found that the correction kit and the circle did a better job with that i used it once
5	this is a lovely pale pink shade the formula goes on easily and looks very natural as a little flush to cheeks it 's too light for me to use on lips now i want to try other shades of jouer tint highly recommended
4	per my wife , the product is very creamy , but it makes face look almost dewy not matte like i and most prefer it feels very lightweight and not cakey at all it provides great coverage but did not cover my pores well , i found that it works best with setting powder if you have oily skin like myself over all a decent product , cannot say enough about the dermablend line , but deducted one start for the dewy look and pore coverage
5	if you do n't over apply the product the first common mistake people make with a foundation like this , is that using more and applying thickly will give better coverage , especially when it comes to birthmarks and dramatic skin imperfections in my experience with it , the opposite held true if i used too much or applied it only with my fingertips , it 's settled into fine lines and made me look about 10 years older when using a beauty blender and the tap tap tap technique , i experienced excellent coverage , a nice finish , and minimal settling into my crow 's feet and marionette lines i also used as setting powder , which is an absolute must , in my opinion was so pleased that i purchased another shade in the same family , in order to do some subtle contouring and create the color that was absolutely perfect for my skin tone
5	this skinmedica complex is great ! ive had several compliments on the appearance of my skin since i started using it but , i should have read the directions first ! it says use once or twice a week starting off i didnt ! i applied every night for several nights in a row as a result , my skin started i realized my mistake after i read the directions but , the great news is that after my skin stopped , it looked great ! i could definitely see a difference in my skin it looked so smooth and brighter ! i love this product and only use it 2 or 3 times a week now highly recommend !
5	at first i thought this was too dark for me , but then i realized you need to use a light touch and a kabuki brush \( i recommend e l f studio kabuki face brush , which can be found here on amazon \) once i used my kabuki brush and used the bronzer sparingly , i realized it gave me a lovely healthy glow i brushed the powder lightly over my cheek bones , chin , nose and forehead it can also be used on shoulders , neck and when wearing summer clothing it sort of reminds me of the glow i would get from indian earth back in the 80 's when i was just a kid the case is kind of weird because it 's meant to be attached to a kit and it does n't come with a brush , but the powder is smooth and silky , so i do n't have any complaints over the lack of brush the kabuki brush i recommended is inexpensive \( 6 \) so it 's not a big investment this powder will be great for summer it sure beats wrinkles and skin cancer and i do n't look orange
4	excellent product would buy again i use a lot of perricone products found this moisturizer to be very good i have found that i break out form hives at times from these products because of the high levels of niacin so i ca n't use all of them just a select few this moisturizer being one of them
5	this is my new favorite bronzer i love matte finish and the product is highly pigmented so a little bit goes a long way my skin tone is on the light medium spectrum and i think the colors looks nice on my skin i was using nars before this and prefer this one because it does not have any sparkle in it i would definitely purchase this again
5	excellent product
4	love this cleanser bought in trial kit first so that i would n't spend too much and not like it it smells kind of weird but i guess that is because it is natural bottles lasts a long time and price is really good compared to similar products
5	i received this concealer in shade 02 i have a very light olive complexion \( greek heritage \) and have had problems finding a shade that would work for me this was perfect for my green undertones i have considerable broken capillaries on one side my nose that developed when i was pregnant with my first child i like to conceal these but most concealers rub off in just a few minutes while this one is not waterproof , it stayed on very well for most of the day i had to reapply twice but compared to other concealers that is hardly at all i am very pleased with the color , the coverage , and the staying power of this concealer and will certainly buy more and other products in this line
3	seems like every one got different products in the phyto gorgeous hair on the go kit i got hair masks these are single use products for longer hair , probably meant as a tester version of a full size product it does help dry hair or chemically treated hair become softer and more manageable like others have said , i do n't see myself purchasing this again as i did not notice significant benefits over other hair masks or argan oil based conditioners that i have used
4	this is really great cream , but do n't do what i did which was purchase a very small tube for 44 i could have bought a for that much of course at the time i did not know that you bet i will do my research next time 15ml is not alot
5	my last bout with perfume was with my fabulous addiction to giorgio of beverly hills she loved it it made me ill because she was so awesome , i forced myself to live with the scent it was n't the smell that bothered me , but some substance in it that gave me massive headaches that was in the 1980s and i have avoided fragrances ever since but what a sad in my life ! after all , smell is one of the five primary senses so , while i hesitated to select this item , a thorough search across the internet convinced me i could safely give it a try how happy i am that i took the risk this eau de rochas is a thoroughly delightful fragrance it is feminine toward unisex , light , intensely citrus , initially cool to warm , with complex herbal qualities there are touches of honeysuckle , jasmine , and coriander as the fragrance develops the process of change from a bright , lemony garden through to a summery , filled forest is seamless , but there are qualities to this eau that are rare , fleeting , and upon initial application , there is a delicate , a sense of cool water over dark rocks in a bubbling spring classic notes including patchouli and woods are present , but never overwhelming this is eau de rochas , one of the most intriguing , complex , yet unassuming fragrances i have ever experienced of course , it is not for everyone , but it is for me and that is unusual indeed if , however , you dislike citrus , you will want to avoid it some reviewers found it to be more like lemon scented cleaning spray than a fragrance they would wear but it seems to me that criticism entirely misses its complexity still , fragrance is very personal and no one can tell any of us what we like or do n't personally , i love it !
5	a necessity for random breakouts ! !
5	would not use anything else ! ! ! the best foundation ! ! !
5	beautiful brownish red color , hard to find locally glides on effortlessly perfect all year long amazon shipments always arrive quickly !
5	i love this burberry scent it 's very light with a little of citrus and floral \( in my opinion \) it 's a huge bottle and one spray is quite strong , so it will last a long time the bottle is so pretty and feminine love it !
5	a friend of mine has much darker skin than i do , so i shared this makeup with her she loves how it matches her skin coloring and it 's easy to apply it does n't feel heavy and does n't rub off , even in hot , humid weather it also serves as a good concealer it blocks out freckles and other blemishes and gives your face a really smooth appearance the only sticking point is the price it 's one of those expensive products you might buy at a whim at sephora , but there are lesser cost alternatives available that do just as a good a job so while it 's a high quality makeup , i did n't see a large difference between this makeup and other products
5	excellent curling iron my hairstylist at aveda uses this curling iron , and recommended it to achieve loose curls beach waves i have very fine shiny hair which is usually difficult to curl with a bit of 25 hairspray my curls last all day ! i would recommend this to anyone with healthy hair \( if your hair is brittle be sure to use a heat protectant and turn down the heat setting \)
4	i am 32 , i have combination skin i do have some wrinkles on my forehead and around my eyes that are small my skin does tend to be on the dry side of combination along my cheeks i love vichy brand and have a few other items that are not included in this set that i used prior to trying this out now , everyone has different skin types and reacts differently to products that are used i found that the was a thicker creamy texture that went on smoothly it does a strong smell and left a powder type of scent which i liked i personally still prefer the brand sunday and algenist for my daily skin care routine what 's included \? one step micellar cleansing water solution \( 1 fl oz \) this will help clean your skin , including makeup and soothes irritation mineral 89 \( 1 69 fl oz \) a light moisturizer that also contains hyaluronic acid to provide your skin with a hydration boost which helps fight visible ageing caused by pollution and stress liftactiv supreme \( 0 51 fl oz \) this will help long term anti aging including fine lines wrinkles , dull skin and loss of firmness i did not see any difference in fine lines or firmness ideal body serum milk skin firming body milk or moisturizer this is not for your face this states it will provide 48 hours of continuous hydration , however i did feel like i needed to reapply by the next day
4	there are many of these products out there that promise much and cost much having only just gotten a bottle of this to test out , i ca n't tell you what the long term effects are , but i 'll try to post an update after about a month of use for now i can say the lotion goes on light and soaks in completely leaving no weird smell , and no burning sensation , so it 's already better than many i have tried as for results stay tuned
4	this is a small jar , which would be good for travel even though there 's not a lot in the jar , a little goes a long way slightly fragrant , but did n't bother my sensitive skin after use , my face felt refreshed and clean , not greasy
4	deliciously cool cream for the whole body absorbs quickly with very little oiliness skin felt very soft this is a personal reference , there is a fragrance with the cream , which reminded me of cream not sure i could continue using it
5	beautiful color for summer or any time of year ! i am very happy with purchase , i highly recommend the zoya brand because it wears well , and are both beautiful shades in this line !
3	based on the list of readily available ingredients , i think this shampoo is very overpriced when i went to review the product , i realized the ingredients are not listed anywhere within the product information , so i will list them here water aqua eau , ammonium laureth sulfate , sodium lauryl sulfate , , cocamidopropyl betaine , propylene glycol , glycol distearate , aloe barbadensis leaf juice , \( carrageenan \) extract , extract , eucalyptus leaf extract , helianthus annuus \( sunflower \) seed extract , extract , extract , panthenol , tocopheryl acetate , acrylates copolymer , ammonium chloride , , ammonium sulfate , benzophenone 4 , 15 7 , citric acid , , ethylhexylglycerin , glycerin , hydrogenated coco glycerides , cocamidopropyl , hydrolyzed wheat protein , hydroxypropyl guar chloride , laureth 9 , lauryl glucoside , laureth 1 , magnesium chloride , magnesium , , , propylene glycol stearate , sodium chloride , sodium sulfate , sodium , tetrasodium edta , trideceth 12 , triethanolamine , maltodextrin , , methylisothiazolinone , phenoxyethanol , potassium sorbate , sodium benzoate , parfum fragrance , citronellol , geraniol , linalool , red 33 \( ci \) , yellow 5 \( ci 19140 \) , blue 1 \( ci 42090 \) , yellow 10 \( ci 47005 \) you will note a lot of non natural ingredients for a premium priced shampoo the product actually has a lighter than expected fragrance but the fragrance is pleasant expected cleansing and manageability was achieved i would compare this product to readily available supermarket brands which leads to my opinion that the product is overpriced additionally , the packaging in exceptionally simple i am surprised at how basic this product is packaged in comparison to some of the company 's other products , such as h2o plus sea marine which is actually priced lower than the h2o plus eucalyptus aloe in summary , this is an average product with an above average price i do not plan on ordering it in the future
5	i usually use the neutrogena lightly tinted sunscreen which is 30 spf but really would like to up the spf for the summer season this la roche posay anthelios clear skin dry touch does not cause breakouts , which is good for me i should mention that i am very fair skinned and have rosacea , which is aggravated by sun exposure so what i do now is mix a little foundation with the la roche posay and apply it to my entire face it does n't say that this sunscreen is specifically for faces , but given the cost \( 19 99 for a 1 7 oz tube \) that 's all i'm going to use it for i really like it and think it works the way i 've been using it for the past several weeks
3	i have medium tones of southeast asian ethnicity my skin is in the warm class with yellow undertones i definitely have use for a concealer for the body , as i have had unsightly bruising and or small rashes from time to time however , the trouble i have is matching the skin on my legs or arms to a concealer that will not only thoroughly cover but also last for a long time the medium is very close to the tan 35w , just a bit darker both suited my skin tone i tried using this concealer for the face and it did n't really look right it is a thinner than i expected and also seems oilier i tried it on my neck , which had a breakout it was very red i tried to neutralize it with a green primer then applied this concealer as you can see from the picture it did not conceal at all , despite several layers i did follow the directions , building with layers then setting with powder but it did not last 16 hours as promised , more like 3 4 i'm not sure how this would be thick enough to cover tattoos
5	good
4	i waited a while to review this so i could tell if it really helped and i 've got to say as someone with thin hair that i think it did unlike some other formulas for this problem , it did n't make my hair crunchy or sticky which was great it smelled good and made my hair soft and nice feeling it really does feel somewhat fuller and better so i like the product a lot price will probably me from buying , which is a shame since it does seem to work
5	love this neon summer collection , and the name says a lot peachy and light , perfect !
3	my package arrived with the lid and pump in a mess despite that , i still had about half the bottle left in the container to use not the best product to ship in the mail envelope in any case , i 've used this product for a week and i have n't seen any visible results yet however , it 's a slightly unpleasant product it 's white and a bit slimy , reminiscent of something else entirely the perfume is also a bit strong if you have a sensitive nose until the product is fully absorbed in , it leaves the skin shiny and sticky whether the product really helps the aging , it 's hard to say , but i just found the overall product on the unpleasant side with the scent , texture , glossy sticky appearance , and the feel not a good start to either your morning or bedtime
4	i got this in the smaller bottle and it seems to work just fine it does n't feel as harsh as most toners and astringents but i do n't like it having a fragrance at all my husband likes it and i use it on him everyday however it does n't irritate his skin and he likes to think he 's getting it just a little cleaner the skin does feel soft and clean after we use this product it does n't feel like it is stripped , just soft and clean with oily skin i do n't mind that feeling though my husband also has extremely oily skin so we hope by continuing to use this daily it will help with the effects of that so far , no irritation , just a clean feel and i will update if i see a marked improvement in my husband 's problem areas the 3 8 ounce is a small bottle and i would probably just go with a larger one if you 're sure you will use it
5	i love this lotion i started using it twice a day for my kp on legs and back of arms after just one week , i could feel my skin super soft and bumps gone now i use it once a day i will continue to buy
5	fabulous product worth the high price
5	nice color , looks great will definitely recommend
4	works great nice color does what it is supposed to do long lasting
5	the pen works very well turn one end and the product is released onto the built in application brush , which can then be the color correction works very well , and some members of the family felt it worked too well \( the circles under their eyes are n't that dark in the first place \) , while those with normally dark complexion under their eyes felt that just a touch of this works brilliantly to eliminate the dark circles no irritation or redness do n't be concerned by the bright color as it goes on , as it blends in quite nicely with foundation , essentially neutralizing to an extent after application
2	what a disappointment ! i have been a fan of la roche posay products for many years and was very much looking forward to trying out this new cleanser but here is what i found cleansing power is average , not good , not bad , and so is the slightly dry feeling after product usage the company says that it has a unique cooling effect for a refreshing , pure feel while i did notice a slight cooling effect , i do n't think that it to much at all i definitely expected something stronger than just a very mild and very fleeting cool feeling but what really , really made me dislike this product is that it is heavily fragranced \( at least to my nose \) i would n't say anything if this were lancome or estee lauder both companies that seem to use a lot of fragrance in their products but this is la roche posay a company that advertises products for sensitive skin and calls itself the brand ! in the product description on their website they describe it as being soap free , alcohol free , paraben free , safe for sensitive skin what they forgot to mention is that they added tons of fragrance to this while the product rinses off ok , the fragrance does not and i could not wait to use some toner to wipe off every trace of this smell that was way too intense for me and that i plain hated while i will continue to love nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href la roche posay toleriane fluid 1 35 ounces dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 la roche posay toleriane fluid 1 35 ounces a nbsp precisely because it is fragrance free and just all around great for sensitive skin , i am still wondering what la roche posay was thinking when they came up with this cleansing gel it simply does not fit their brand philosophy nor does it smell good at all
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i just found this cc cream it is organic and no bad chemicals it does 12 functions i got the warm glow color matches my skin perfectly it 's not heavy , but it evens out skin tone and gives an awesome glow those fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead are barely visible now it seems like my skin gets better after i wash it off i put it on over a light moisturizer and its perfect
5	my acne has mostly been cured but sometimes , as an adult does this ever end \? this is a nice to have overnight treatment i loved the fact the applicator has an aluminum tip so much easier to keep bacteria cleaned off this way if you apply this vichy targeted treatment exactly where you need it , you will get results in about 20 hours i had three not terrible patches , and they were greatly reduced by the next day , after one treatment i used after a shower and applied to problem areas less , no painful stinging , just effective redness and acne resolved small tube can go with you in your bag
5	i love trying different beauty products and have tried many different facial products and brands i have tried many vichy facial products and have liked pretty much all of them including this mineral water gel moisturizer this has a creamy gel feel and goes on moist but quickly absorbs into your skin it has a pleasant beauty scent to it which i find pleasant it leaves your skin dewy without being greasy i will use this product after getting ipl procedures or microdermabrasion as this product will not irritate my skin further overall i really like this moisturizer
5	i was looking for this color for a while i used to get l'oreal spice things up but had a hard time finding it this is almost an exact match perfect , almost a brick red , some would call terracotta nice shine as well great to wear to a professional office , or even out and about , as it is not a super red has the same impact as red , but just a twist
5	i started using vichy products when i lived in europe and have recommended them to friends and family because they really work i had heard of the hype surrounding micellar water , but was n't sure about it myself well , i 've been convinced by the 3 in 1 calming cleansing water by vichy i 've been using using it every night to remove makeup and dirt and my skin has never felt better apparently the hype was true ! despite having very sensitive skin , this product is gentle yet cleansing and tones perfectly truly amazing and i would highly recommend
4	this is a cream for removing age spots by gentle , very gradual exfoliation , rather than by bleaching it also works as a moisturizer it 's not to your face i applied it all along both arms to try to remove the numerous freckles there this cream does not irritate my rather sensitive skin , nor does it smell bad like some of the bleaching creams i 've used use this as a moisturizer if you hope for a tiny bit of exfoliation in addition the label says it takes 8 weeks to begin to see any change in your dark spots
5	a reorder for a friend that uses for a home business always pleased with it
5	this stuff smells so amazing like childhood a hint of cotton and so fresh ! it 's definitely pricey \( the bottle is n't huge \) but it 's a nice indulgence and my hair is so dang shiny after using highly recommend !
4	i do not have stretch marks from my recent pregnancy but i love this cream as a moisturizer after showers it is easily absorbed and works well for my dry skin stretch marks are genetic so caveat
5	great power to blow out shinny hair not heavy and it has a beautiful sleek design you can feel its power in your hands
5	greatest dry shampoo out there for blonde hair doesnt dry mine out
5	good basic moisturizer not heavy or greasy
5	love , love this flat iron i have baby fine hair and it has so many setting it does not break my hair best flatiron i have ever had
5	excellent product , i love it , it 's just what i needed
3	the tops to these things are absolute crap the product itself is great , but the tops are just trash
5	very moisturizing with the ability to slowly exfoliate your lips as time pass a rich consistency with a pleasant taste and texture a staple that i keep on my nightstand and use throughout the day my daughter is also a big fan
4	about 20 years ago \( ugh feeling old \) , this was the perfume cologne that the cool kids wore i decided recently that it still smells pretty darn good and wanted to go retro like the secret hipster that i am everyone in their 30s 40s recognizes the scent even if they do n't know exactly that it 's ck1 my only complaint is that it can give me a headache worth it
1	i love amazon prime , esp prime day \( s \) with all the deals , so i ordered this at the amazing price of 88 88 recently i was somewhat suspicious when it arrived 2 days later because nothing was plastic wrapped \( like its new \) , the brush powered up immediately \( does n't it have to be charged \? \? \) , and the did not look right the bristles were more in distinct vs together so i reviewed youtube videos , and mine did not like the ones on line , just so i took it to sephora , and a clarisonic salesperson showed me theirs , and sure enough theirs did micro not just vibrations mine appears legit according to , again , youtube videos , maybe these are just old ones they are trying to get rid of \( that 's what the salesperson thought \) i had it one day , it charged fine , numbers and markings all appear fine just did n't work the same as the ones at sephora so , i returned the amazon one today and up the extra cash for the sephora one , a seller of these look at yours carefully if you bought from amazon , esp on prime day it may be fine , it may not be i do n't believe mine was i 've included a pic of what the brush should look like
4	this product has a lot to offer generous size \( 1 7 oz more product than the drugstore brands i usually purchase \) , luxurious , creamy texture , instant absorption and hydration of skin , and a light , fresh scent that dissipates quickly the big drawback is the price i usually spend no more than 15 on hydrating moisturizers and stick to brands like l'oreal and oil of olay however , i would splurge on this occasionally , especially in the winter when my skin gets more dry it would also make a wonderful gift
1	this is a very heavy cover up that feels heavy on your face im used to more of a tinted moisturizer , this feels like a heavy paste im smearing on my face gets into all the cracks and crevices of my face and makes me look older than wearing no make up at all ! color does not go well with my skin tone either would not recommend
4	the color was a lot darker than i had expected it reminds me of sally hasen 's brick wall , which i already have
4	the incredible scent of eucalyptus is energizing matched up with aloe it is soothing and left my hair feeling clean and fresh lately i have been using a shampoo with tea tree oil this has turned out to be a refreshing alternative in terms of a great tingling sensation , invigorating scent , and comfort \( non irritating \) this is one of the best eucalyptus shampoos available and its quality is hard to beat h2o is a great brand that is known for its innovative product line and is available from the better stores in chicago , as well as its own stores
4	the shellac is great the color meh its almost skin tone , so it looks like im not really wearing polish this may be good as a base for a french manicure , but i have n't tried that yet
3	pretty color but it is really silver not gray , lighter than appears in the picture , its okay but i really needed wanted a color that was gray and a little darker
5	the best makeup base i have ever used i sprayed it on as soon as i got out of the shower and my makeup lasts all day
1	i really liked the feeling this device provided while i was using it it felt like my skin was getting very clean , but , unfortunately , after i was finished the surface of my skin was covered with tiny vein i used it on the lowest setting and did not use it aggressively , but my skin looked almost like it had been burned afterward ! i put chamomile on my face and it calmed down by the next morning with just a hint of redness , but it scared me when i thought it might be permanent ! i love the idea of this unit and if you have skin i think it could be a great benefit in keeping your skin clean and bright so i gave it three stars , but if you have rosacea like me you might want to steer clear of any kind of device like this that aggressively stimulates the skin 's surface cheers , ps it always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful if you 'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment i usually respond the same day , so if you have a question or comment \( even if it 's just to say , hi ! \) feel free to post it below
4	hampton sun spf 15 tanning gel is an excellent way to maintain a sun kissed glow , yet still get excellent protection form harmful uva uvb rays when i first sprayed on this gel formula , i thought it felt a bit on the oily side , which is why i usually go for a cream in my tanning products i was pleasantly surprised to see that it absorbs quickly into the skin , leaving a nice , silky finish the spray on feature makes for easy application to all areas of the body , although i did n't not use it on my face containing ingredients such as oxybenzone are crucial to blocking out the rays that will cause burning and also cancer , so i knew this product would give me great protection i already had a slight base tan , and i do recommend that anyone using it do as well even though it is an spf 15 , it is not a complete block and you will still get some of the sun 's rays just not the harmful ones it has a very pleasant smell to it , which i liked as well as the slight shimmer it left on my skin i would stress again , that only people with a base tan that want to increase their skin tone and not have a complete block use this product
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
1	my husband has been using toppik for awhile now it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head , which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair and in the sun , it actually turns a pinkish red \( he uses dark brown \) ! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie even with a bit of wind or humidity , the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face , making it look like tar it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still do n't know that he uses the product ! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind , constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product , and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it does n't even bother me , my husband constantly obsesses over his hair instead of enhancing his look , toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place instead of boosting his confidence , toppik has made him even more insecure about losing his hair
5	i absolutely love burberry brit splash , eau de toilette ! it is a perfect blend of sporty and mature ish scent and is not overpowering you do n't have to use much at all , and yet , the fragrance will last all day , even after a night of and stuff the best is my wife loves it \( her new favorite , she said \) it is clean , fresh , and still subtle , and as my wife says , sexy fragrances are so subjective , and often depend on skin type , etc my skin is usually dry and not oily i also find that i always need to let a cologne \( or edt \) kind of settle in before i pass judgement because things change for me after just a few minutes this is a big bottle , and unlike some there burberry products , this spray is easy to so you do n't get a huge spray the only negative i can think of is that the cap is very tight a little difficult to remove , and because the bottle is so smooth , it sometimes feels like i might drop the bottle or something as i am pulling it off still , it looks nice you see the burberry design , but does n't look
5	love all his products but this feels so good on your face , leaving it nice and smooth and refreshed
3	i wanted to like this makeup it 's generally a great brand but this foundation did n't work out for me it does make my skin look matte and less oily it blends in easily but after wearing it for about an hour it settles into my pores and makes me look older and like i'm wearing a thick mask of makeup if i sweat or touch my skin it rubs off very easily i have combination skin where i'm oily in the t zone and dry on my cheeks and chin it looks good on the t zone , but the dry parts of my skin , mainly my cheeks is where the makeup looks caked on i would n't recommend this for people who have dry or combination skin maybe it would work best for someone who is oily all over their face
4	very moisturizing
4	i 've been using the nuface trinity trainer wrinkle reducer for three weeks and i have seen improvement in my skin 's elasticity , texture , and overall youthfulness the device is easy to use and comes with the trinity trainer , wrinkle reducer \( attachment \) , charging base primer gel immediately upon opening the box i plugged the device up to charge \( it 's suggested to charge for 12 hours \) and read the instructions i was impressed with the detailed instructions i recommend watching the videos on nuface 's website , as well as , youtube the before after pictures are quite dramatic and the customer comments on the nuface facebook page suggest people are very pleased with this device my experience thus far i would rate as better than average it has n't been the instant , omg what did you do \? it 's been subtle changes over the last three weeks that are n't so readily noticeable by people that see me everyday however , my cousin \( i have n't seen in about a year \) noticed immediately ! she said my face looked rejuvenated and had a glow which encouraged me to continue using nuface if you are going to invest the money in this product , you have to invest the time to use it properly everyone is different , but this has been my daily nuface regiment wash face thoroughly , making sure all make up is removed , dry completely apply primer gel in first area to be treated i always begin with my right , lower jawline starting at the , i slowly sweep across my face , to the nose \( repeating this 3 times , as instructed \) if the gel starts to dry , i dab a drop of water on my finger tip , then gently swirl on my face , til the gel feels refreshed i continue up the side of my face , in sections the width of the device \( applying gel to each section as i go \) right side complete , i move to the left , lower jawline and repeat the exact same steps , moving or repeating a section when the device beeps i then sweep my forehead and neck area \( always in sections the width of the device \) lastly , i switch to the wrinkle reducer \( slowly moving the device over my forehead , under eye to corner , face folds \( aka laugh lines \) then under chin \( neck area \) treatment complete , i clean the attachments with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol then return it to the charging cradle i then apply my face cream from start to finish about all of this sounds like a long drawn out process , but honestly it only takes about 22 and considering this can be done while sitting on the watching television it 's really not a long time it certainly does n't seem like too much when you get results of course we all like things to be fast and painless , but anything worth having is worth investing the time to get that 's the big thing with this device , you have to do it everyday , because results are cumulative although there was nothing in the literature about acne , i did notice a substantial improvement in that area the unit itself is chunky and heavy , very well constructed however , if you have small hands , like me , it gets uncomfortable after prolonged use simply resting a minute or so and you 're ready to go i mention it only to be thorough turning it on , adjusting the strength of the current and switching attachments is easy the dial on the front lights up blue when turned on , and with each click to increase or decrease , there 's an beep similar to that the device makes when you are using it , indicating it is time to move to the next section there is a one year warranty , but you must register your device in order to activate it my main complaint with this kit , is what it lacks i think all the face attachments should be included i mean , would n't most people want to treat their entire face and to begin the treatment of all areas at the same time that 's why i think the eye and lip attachments should be included with the face trainer kit hopefully , there will be others to voice this opinion and the company will offer a complete kit for the whole face in a nut shell keeping in mind i 've only used this product for less than 30 days and the suggested time is 60 days if you are looking for a quick fix and fast , dramatic improvements , it would be best to call a plastic surgeon if however , you are willing to dedicate yourself to using this device daily and have reasonable expectations , by all means , buy it ! if your results are like mine , you will be glad you did ! https be link to helpful youtube video
5	this is a beautiful blending brush and very quickly becoming my favorite the bristles are ultra soft and the brush just glides over your skin the rubber coated handle makes it easy to hold what i do n't like about this brush is that there is no cover or case for it that means that if i toss it in my cosmetic bag the brushes are unprotected and are surely going to get ruined
3	the cream feels great it really is hydrating and does n't feel greasy the only problem is the scent is way too strong it smells like baby powder or something it 's overwhelming , especially for something used on the face i do n't know why it needed any scent at all it 's a bit too much for my taste
5	wonderful toner just spray on face and continue other product applications does not dry or irritate at all this is a great line for people with sensitive skin and not just rosacea issues
4	i have always liked bliss products and generally had good results with them this one does n't disappoint neither this orange tinted serum is easy to apply , goes on smoothly and dries quickly it smells pleasant as well i ca n't say it has made a difference in the appearance of fine lines or uneven tones if it has , it would be marginally noticeable that said , it does leave the skin feeling soft and smooth the skin also seems to take on a more healthier glow i usually follow up with a moisturizer to keep it soft and supple overall , this skin care product seems to help i quite like it so far
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
3	i 've used the oil for 3 months now and have found its usage to be only minimal effective i type most of the day at work and thought this would help with some of the slight pain associated with that it may of helped a bit and it does keep the hands hydrated i am a fan of the smell as well , its quite pleasant however , the product is n't very effective and is overpriced i think its wrong to market this as a muscle relieving oil when they effects are minimal , at best
5	great product
3	i adore oribe products , but this one is just meh the product smells great but rates an average in the moisturizing , shine , and flyaways tamer department a better bet is fekkai 's cream give that one a try
3	this is good if you do n't particularly care for how clean your skin feels i felt like i put yogurt on my face and then washed it off it was good if i just wanted to wash my face to wake up in the morning but did n't do a whole lot other than maybe reduce the redness on my face smells and tastes nice \( when it would accidentally get in my mouth \) maybe my problem was that the wash did n't foam , but it 's not a bad product
4	i was skeptical , but this product really is fun to use and feels great on the skin the aerosol disperses a fine , light mist i also like how 's it 's just pure water with no fragrances or silicones other fillers like many other toners it 's a small canister , and lightweight enough to conveniently carry with you in a tote bag
4	so i really got this to compare to nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href veet silk light based ipl hair removal system for home use dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 veet infini'silk light based ipl hair removal system for home use a nbsp which i also own when just looking at them , there seems to be only minor differences this model comes with a case and separate trimmer , it also says it is safe for use on the face while the other model specifically says not to use on face size wise there does n't seem to be any significant difference what you feel while using it is the same , the overall look is nearly the same , i only notice a color difference but am in the middle of from a move and have n't found my other one so i am going from memory the veet infini'silk had an expected pulses this model has neither offers replacement cartridges as some others do that out of the way , my experience with both of these in similar i use level 4 5 but i do have sensitive skin so i worked my way up to that some people describe it as burning , if you feel that , please start a lower level than what you started at \( the booklet tell you what your ideal max level is based on skin tone and hair \) i am really pale but have some lighter hair and some darker it 's best used on darker hair you may or may not get results on lighter hair personally because my lighter hair is on place like my arms , where i do n't care as much as say my legs \? i 've just skipped using in on the lighter hair since there are a limited number of pulses \( some of their other models have cartridges you can buy when the pulsing has stopped working \) i 've never the number of pulses i need because the legs can be tricky , but each underarm is going to have you using 3 5 per arm it can take awhile to do the legs the actual section that the light pulses through is about 1 1 4 long and 1 2 wide that is what you will be using to target the hair with that light window is about smack dab in the middle of the part you place against your skin so you want to be careful to get all of the area you are targeting without overlapping it 's a bit of a learn as you go process when i accidentally i sometimes had skin irritation it did n't last long and really was n't bad , but is something to be aware of i have n't used more traditional laser hair removal i will say that you do get better results if you shave or use a depilatory cream \( veet or nair \) and use this than if you just shave or use a depilatory cream alone do not use any hair removal devices that pull the hair out by the root before using this it needs some hair below the surface in order to target it will you get amazing permanent results \? do n't expect miracles you will reduce hair growth , i have found that some of my hair is more stubborn than others right around my knees for example seem extra stubborn compared to the rest of my leg so i made sure to target it extra carefully and still had lesser results my underarm , however , seems to benefit more how well you keep to a schedule with this device will also affect your results there were times i was using it as often as was safe and other times when i a little because who wants to take the time to run this device up and down their legs when they can do it tomorrow how well it works for you is really just a matter of do your skin tone and hair colors that you will target fall within the ideal ranges , do you use the device regularly , and honestly it seems to be a bit of luck some who seem to fit about the same description as me and kept to a regular schedule seem to have lesser results than me while some others who do n't fit the ideal description and in using it seemed to get better results than me for me \? it really limits the number of days between shaves before it i 'd probably shave every 3 days , now i can go a week , sometimes longer depending on the area the silk'n trim is a nice bonus but probably not necessary other similar devices sell for around 10 the case for this is the biggest difference i see between this and my prior silk'n light based hair removal device i have kept that one in the cardboard is arrived in , which has n't been ideal the case with this is much appreciated like the other device , you must leave it plugged in that , for me , is the biggest negative with this device if you do n't have a convenient place to sit and use this device that is next to an outlet , you better remedy that there is no cordless option so would i recommend it \? basically if shaving using a depilatory cream less often is important to you and you 're willing to trade off that for a day every week or two of targeting those areas with this device \? i 'd say go for it if that does n't seem like the benefit is worth the hassle \? it 's not for you after consistent use the benefits should be more obvious and may result in even greater times between your normal hair removal routine but , again that 's going to vary for everyone update i finally the veet infini'silk and took a picture of the two side by side this silk'n flash go is the pink one in the case while the veet infini'silk is the purple in the cardboard box
4	thought it would be a little darker , but overall still a good color !
5	this foundation is easier to control than other liquid makeup i 've tried it 's comfortable to wear and feels breathable it has great wearability and lasts all day unless i exercise heavily or get caught in a lot of rain however , it washes off easily with regular face cleansers ! i have sensitive skin and this product has n't caused any irritation or breakouts there 's no obnoxious fragrance or chemical smell one caution while this makeup is very blendable before it sets , once it does , it 's not the best application method i 've found is to dot the foundation over areas i want to cover and then blend with a foundation brush it seems a little too slippery for fingers again , be sure to blend quickly as the foundation sets and stays ! also , start with less makeup than you think you will need a little of this foundation goes a way i recommend this foundation ! it feels nice to wear and lasts all day and the pigments are really beautiful
4	this cleanser is pretty darn awesome do n't let the odd look and the seaweed deter you not only does it clean well without overly stripping your skin , but it has a gentle exfoliation with the seaweed bits it 's soothed my skin and made it glow in a way it has n't in a while the only caveat i have with this product is that you must remove your makeup for it to be at its best most do anyway but sometimes i'm lazy and just do a double cleanse with my previous cleanser with this one it 's best if you get everything off first but other than that it 's really wonderful if you are looking for the tight burning feeling that some cleansers leave you with \( which is n't good for your skin ! \) this is n't your kind of cleanser
5	this is a great summer or vacation color easy to apply , bright and cheerful , it 's perfect with summer clothing or maybe even a pick me up in the winter i'm going to try it on my toes for next vacation great color for your shellac collection
4	this is a very nice contour highlighting brush it applies product nice and even handle fits nice in hand works well , looks nice very nice brush
1	i like the product , but was looking for an easier way to apply instead of just shaking it on i thought his was my solution it did not fit the canister and even if it did , it was a bulb type of spray it would have been hard to use , if it fit the canister
1	junk mascara in my opinion ! i used 2 coats which did not even match a single coat of ysl or tarte mascara took 3 rounds of using my mascara remover \( which removes even waterproof in one sweep \) to get this stuff off very clumpy when removing , leaving my lashes sticking together in the end it cost me several lashes which did not make me happy i definitely do not recommend nor will i buy this brand again
5	i like all the eltamd products
5	makes my skin super soft highly recommended !
1	this is almost white not nearly the pink they show in the picture wo n't buy polish on line again
3	this is a clear gel primer i am not satisfied with this purchase i have huge pores and i do n't feel this did what it claims to do i assume this might work for you if you have smaller pores the primer goes on smoothly it is comparable to smashbox 's primer it simply did not work for me , and i would probably never use it on a customer either i am going back to philosophy 's poreless primer
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	the sensitive clarisonic heads are , in my opinion at least , the best of the bunch they clean wonderfully without irritating the skin this is a legit four pack \( i e there are actually four inside \) and they are not some cheap knockoff
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
5	this product saved my skin i'm 42 years old so now fighting wrinkles and acne always had oily acne prone skin but it was under control until my face care line was discontinued and \( no doubt some hormonal shifts as well \) contributed to a very stressful face full of problems this line has been great for me and my skin has finally cleared up \( especially breakouts around my mouth and chin \) and the glycolic acid has done wonders for discolorations and fine lines i would recommend taking it easy with the clarifying solution i was using it twice a day and broke out again then realized it was a sensitivity reaction to the glycolic acid i do not have sensitive skin as a general rule so be mindful if you do i now use it only once in the evening and have taken to leaving my face wet after cleansing and applying gently with a cotton pad the irritation is gone and the results are great use the spot treatment as a spot treatment sparingly and only where needed not on large parts of your face
4	this color is a medium density pink with some sparkle it is almost a neutral kind of pink i wear it when i ca n't pick what color i want i consider it one of my nudes i love the vinylux polishes they last much longer than the regular polish and are much easier to take off this color stayed on very well for 7 days sometimes the polish will wear at the tips and very rarely have a small chip at the tips but usually by that time i am ready to change the color anyway all in all , very happy with purchase no complaints
4	very lovely light soft color with sparkle , used it over another color as this was very light shellac is the way to go , lasts at least two weeks and then some
5	good
5	soft , smooth and highly pigmented ! i picked up and lace , both are vibrant shades of pink is amazing for a fresh flush , while lace is bright but still very wearable the price is good , especially since a little product goes a long way the packaging is perfect , slim lined with a mirror i would suggest starting out with a light hand i honestly ca n't wait to pick up more colors in the instain blush line !
5	i read some of the reviews about people having adverse reactions dryness , redness and irritation i 've been using this every other evening i did have a little peeling but nothing that ca n't be moisturized i was happy to lose a layer honestly i think it revives the skin i have previously used other retinol products , like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href retinol moisturizer cream for face and eye area with retinol hyaluronic acid vitamin e anti aging formula reduces look of wrinkles fine lines best day and night cream 1 7 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 retinol moisturizer cream for face and eye area with retinol , hyaluronic acid , vitamin e anti aging formula reduces look of wrinkles , fine lines best day and night cream 1 7 fl oz a nbsp and nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href naturals retinol cream moisturizer 1 7 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 naturals retinol cream moisturizer 1 7 oz a and have 25 concentration , and this is 50 so i went easy on the first few applications you also have to follow up with a moisturizer for this one to keep dryness at bay overall so far i really like it ! i 'll continue to use it and update my review as needed
5	pretty color with just a hint of shimmer
5	i love this please note i only use it on bangs and smaller areas as my hair is straight but for straightening pieces that curl when sleeping it is perfect i love how the size makes it so easy to bring when travelling
5	i'm giving this 5 stars because when i asked my wife how much she would be willing to pay for it she said 30 and i see that it actually costs 29 \( at least as i write this \) that 's a lot by our standards , so she must really like it she said it does a really good job moisturizing her skin she also took the opportunity to remind me how much she likes facial phyto peel by ageless la cure which is even more expensive \( a lot more expensive \) but worth every penny
5	have used this cleanser for several years it has done a great job of cleansing my dry skin without drying it further this line of products is excellent
5	this burberry parfum comes in a burberry box the burberry london logo is a glued on block when you pull the bottle out of the outer box there in an internal split sleeve that easily falls out of the way the bottle is covered with a textured cloth that makes it easy to hold the cap pulls off to reveal a sprayer you can see through the glass at the top all the way through the perfume through the bottom the perfume has a slightly pink tint and i like being able to see it so i can tell home much is left not needed now but in the future i 'll be able know when to drop hints that mom needs some new scent i love the scent it 's not overwhelming but gentle flowery with strong hints of sandalwood and musk it took me a while of inhaling but i finally did recognize the patchouli very nice done to me the scent is unique and i really like it it 's warm and friendly and quite affordable given how much you get for this price i actually prefer this now to my chanel 5
5	great product overall i think cnd is the best shellac around i have several colors now i will purchase even more
5	love this concealer foundation ! beautiful results leaving me looking and feeling ultra feminine i give this five stars and a big thumbs up !
5	i have been using this cleanser in conjunction with the mb cucumber cleansing lotion for almost a year and cannot believe i ever used anything else i love these products ! they have changed my skin and made me more confident
5	excellent sunscreen my sons always complain about sun tan lotion burning their skin however , they did n't complain about this one works well , and protected their skin for the all day at the park great product !
5	very good coverage and good for my skin ! !
5	absolutely love this ! if you are on the fence about this , let me help push you over this is amazing i have long , very thick hair i will style my hair with this , use my boar bristle brush to soften the curls and then i have gorgeous waves curls for days i use some dry shampoo as needed \( washing hair daily is a \) and even after days the curls fall into nice waves and give great body to my hair it cuts down the time curling sooo much ! my hair hits mid back when not curled and would take me 35 to curl it before i had this , now its done in max to the reviewers saying their hair burned you can adjust the temp on it also , use heat protecting spray this is an awesome weapon for your hair arsenal i attached a photo of the back of my hair 3 days after i first styled the trick is wash your hair at night , then use a thermal active setting spray to both protect hair and hold curls , i finish with loreal hair spray and do a gentle sweep with my boar bristle brush it seems like a lot of steps , but it leaves me with days of great hair
5	i really like this sun screen because it is so light on the skin , that it is easy to forget you have it on unfortunately , being winter it 's hard to test this fully , but i did put it on for cross country skiing and love that it did not have a heavy oily feel it goes on clean and for the sunny , snow reflecting day i spent skiing , it seemed to work fine i am looking forward to testing it at the pool this summer , but if it is as water resistant as it claims this self may have found his new solution
5	perfect crisp white for all seasons !
3	so i'm having a difficult time finding anything to apply it i used a cheap sponge that comes from another brand and color of eyeshadow and it seemed to go on well even though i have very crepey eyelids but since it goes with another eyeshadow , i need one specifically for this color eyeshadow however i emailed the company to ask for a brush or applicator recommendation and they would n't recommend anything although they actually sell brushes , i found out later i do n't live near malls or any beauty supply stores so buying makeup brushes can only be done online and sometimes i am lucky , and sometimes not if someone reads this and can give me a recommendation , i would appreciate it i love the color of the eyeshadow although it is shimmery but not enough that i ca n't wear it in the daytime the color seemed to make my eyes look less droopy , but i wo n't know until i get an appropriate applicator that is not mixed with another color one brush i used , was totally ineffective at picking up the color
5	this pomade is tricky to use at first because the texture of it is very hard you only need a little smudge of it to hold hair down or create a dip , curl or wave it has barely any scent this jar will go a long way because you use so little it is very long lasting , it lasts a full day into night it did last that long for me the hold is n't hard feeling , it 's semi flexible the long wear is exceptional i have n't tried this in high humidity , our weather has been so dry , but i am curious to see if it retains it 's hold in damp or humid weather i am very happy with it
1	i 've used a full of elemis products for over a month and am leaving reviews on each one regarding the marine creme , i have n't found it to be of any use elemis boasts this as their most popular product but i ca n't understand why as i see no real benefit in fact , my complexion was more congested after using this considering the massive price tag , this earns it a very low rating i personally think elemis reviews their own products with high marks as part of their marketing because i find most of them to be shockingly overrated
5	i have been using mostly babyliss styling tools for some years now no problems with this one works great so far no papers inside the package hope it is a genuine product
5	great product to use with the cnd system large bottle to a lot off manicures super fast shipping i will purchase again
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	i am no perfume expert by any means and rarely purchase any there are some perfumes that you can smell and right away your head starts to a bit from the odor i was worried this might be one , but my first smell test of it showed that i did n't have to worry about that it was very light and airy smelling at first i put some on my neck and wrists and forced my husband to sniff it and he approved i then got in my car to drive , with windows up , and soon it became a much stronger smell and a little thicker in scent i worried my would get put off by it , but that proved not to be a problem i really did n't even smell it much later on during the day , and alas , no one commented on it i guess the lesson learned was to put on a bit less and do a more spraying of the mist when putting it on to me this seems like a pretty safe bet of a perfume purchase it might not be favorite , but i do n't think many people will hate it because it does come off as light and fresh smelling the bottle is by no means eye catching , but i for one am of its wide base tall skinny bottles just get knocked over too easily , and do n't get me started on cats and knocking stuff over
2	i found this full coverage stick not that easy to apply it is hard to glide on to get full coverage and the directions say to tap it to get more coverage in order for it to do that i would have had to have tapped it hard enough to break the stick just not a successful coverage
1	okay this iron has a problem i do n't know why the reviews did n't mention how the barrel clip is short if you have a long hair , more than half of your hair wo n't curl clip needs to be longer in order for it to curl well
4	i have naturally blonde hair with highlights the highlights are because my blond hair has gotten slightly darker with age i only have highlights put in about every 3 months being a natural blonde , i do have a of blonde colors in my natural hair , some of which are very yellow gold looking this color wow brass banned mousse for blonde hair did tone down my brassiness i was actually surprised that i could tell a difference it just seemed to brighten things up i have thick hair , but it is baby fine it is also about shoulder length i do n't normally like using mousse , because my hair tangles easily , and other mousses have made it difficult for me to dry my hair without adding extra tangles because of the stiff feeling the color wow mousse did not make it feel like that i did feel a little difference in my texture , but nothing extreme enough to bother me or to tangle my hair i wash my hair at night and fix it in the morning i figured the mousse would not affect anything about the styling , because it felt like it normally does in the morning i straighten my hair with a straightening brush \( looks kind of like a paddle brush but is heated \) the color wow made it so that i could wear my hair flatter if i wanted or with more volume if i wanted to go that way i do n't like a lot of volume , but it was easy to control the only negative i have about this mousse is that when i brushed my hair and was straightening it , i had white debris falling onto my shoulders it did n't seem to do it once i was done fixing my hair , though it could be my reaction to the ingredients , or it could be that i waited overnight to style my hair
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	love this keratin i live in florida so this is key to keeping my hair nice and moisturized in the deep southern heat and humidity use sparingly for thin hair \( not to it \) leaves a great amount of shine and texture while helping to hold style thru humidity overall i love this product
4	the la roche anthelios 60 ultra light sunscreen spray lotion works pretty well for a spray on sunblock the spray mechanism disperses the sunblock well \( assuming you are just using it on your face \) however , i still prefer the regular anthelios sunblock , since it has just one step with the spray on , you still have to rub it in anthelios works great though it 's real sunblock that will actually protect you look up consumer report 's reviews
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	wonderful neutral color
5	i purchased these \( 26 \) to give as a thank you for my baby shower they have not been given yet but if it is anything like any other essie product it will be well recieved this was the best price for essie without going to some unknown website that sold imatation items i look forward to sharing these with my guests we are very excited that the pink with the sparkles will represent our daughter !
5	works
5	this is a better self tanning product than usual you really should have the mitt to apply it and rinse the mitt first and let it dry before using it when you use the tanning lotion , even with the mitt also be sure to wash your hands thoroughly it does dry relatively quickly and is not orangey it has more of an olive tone , which looks more natural it does not smell chemically and has a very slight vanilla scent you do need to be careful around your elbows and even knees you need to use left over after you do your normal application for some reason if you apply it the same as other areas they will turn out much darker it is a good self tanner
5	i have ultra sensitive skin , and there are very few moisturizers that cause an itchy rash the moisture magnet is one of those few moisturizers that i can use it makes my skin feel dewy and soft even more amazing \? when i have an allergic rash elsewhere on my body , a little moisture magnet soothes the rash and makes it stop itching this is one i'm going to keep on hand all the time
2	mario badescu rocks great , rich serum , leaves skin so soft update still love all my mario badescu products esp this serum but the dropper is as cheap as they come i 've ordered 2 vit c serums so far and both droppers came apart before i was even 1 3 of the way through the bottle since vitamin c turns bad so easily with out a tight seal \( and stored in cool , dark place \) both bottles turned before i was even half way through not worth the money with out getting an entire bottles worth of serum !
3	made me breakout , and pump broke easily
5	this nail polish is the best ! yes , it is kind of expensive , but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful
5	i had forgotten how much i loved the scent of almond in beauty products until i tried this i think the scent of this shower oil is amazing \( your opinion , of course , will depend on whether or not you like almond scented products \) i do feel that this was effective at cleansing my skin i used this after several tough workouts and i feel that it \( in combination with a pouf sponge \) removed sweat , oil , and dead skin cells please keep in mind that this is a shower oil and not a shower gel or body wash , so it will not have the same texture and consistency it was a little thin and , despite claims on the product page to the contrary , it did not really lather or foam here are the ingredients since i did n't see them on the product page water , shea butter , glycerin , caprylic capric triglyceride , grape seed oil , dicaprylyl carbonate , dimethicone , apricot kernel oil , cetearyl alcohol , glyceryl stearate , coconut oil , sweet almond fruit extract , honey extract , hydroxyethyl acrylate sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer , tocopherol , ethylhexylglycerin , fragrance , xanthan gum , propylene glycol , sorbitan isostearate , polysorbate 60 , chlorphenesin , peg 100 stearate , phenoxyethanol , ceteareth 33 , benzyl alcohol , benzyl benzoate , hydroxyisohexyl 3 , cyclohexene carboxaldehyde , linalool , citronellol , butylphenyl methylpropional , coumarin , hexyl cinnamal , limonene , geraniol love that it does n't contain any artificial fragrances or dyes please note that it does contain silicones if you are looking to avoid those however , it is free of sulfates this is pretty gentle on the skin , i think , and i do feel like my skin was softer after using it \( to be fair , i was also using body lotion , so i ca n't attribute the softness 100 to this product but this certainly was n't hurting ! \)
4	provides great lubrication for my merkur long handle safety razor with feather de blade to glide smoothly , smells great , only a little is needed i apply an almond sized amount to my face and it is enough for the shave i just add water when needed i tried different versions of shaving creams , gels , foams , and brush applied soaps , and i eventually stuck with cream i think this shaving cream from proraso is as good , but , sadly , it is quite a bit pricier i also wish it had a bigger cap so i could stand it up vertically
4	i have dry skin and i have always wanted to give cream blush a try i made sure my skin was washed prepped and once i applied this i found it to be smooth and creamy and have a nice smell also , not testing on animals makes me feel better about using it i used a blush brush to apply , but you could also use your fingers and then blend in i find this to not be glossy and to have more of a matte look which is beautiful the product size is quiet small , but i found that it did n't take much to bring color to my cheeks and i find that the size price and for how long makeup should be used for is all in line
5	i am quite light skinned and when i was asked to try shade 05 , i thought it might be too dark i am more than pleasantly surprised that it blended with my skin tones since you can build up the coverage , there is flexibility with this foundation , which i find unusual and of high quality i have had the cosmetic on for over 12 hours , and my face remains fresh looking , i do not have to touch it up or apply an extra coat or a separate powder product i am very pleased to be introduced to this cream foundation i usually use liquid but this formula is easy to apply and a welcome change from other products
5	this stuff is strong enough to cleanse but mild enough to not irritate sensitive skin
3	i like the consistency of this product creamy , not sticky or heavy at all it sinks into my skin quickly and is non greasy im not able to smell any scent at all it comes in a nice jar i put it on at night and see no staining of my pillow case a slight case of winter , flaky skin has disappeared my complaint would be the price it seems other moisturizers would work as well without costing so much id buy the product in the future if it were n't for the price tag
5	that 's how i describe this scent it 's more along this brand 's line of obsession rather than the ck product line \( more fresh and clean smelling \) the top note of euphoria is definitely sweet \( as in the sweetness of myrrh rather than floral \) that tones down considerably to a warm , smoky , spicy scent my husband ordinarily likes more green based fragrances like vetiver but this modern , sexy , and sophisticated scent has won him over the silage is good , it lasts well on him but this seems to be the case with most colognes the sweetness might be the only aspect of this cologne that might put someone off but it does disappear after about 20 min and it has settled down and mixed with his body chemistry i envision this cologne being perfect for evening wear and fall winter , maybe a bit too spicy for summer and he agrees , i guess it depends upon your taste he prefers a shower smell for the office if you like a more incense type of scent vs green or woodsy , you 'll probably enjoy this one but i honestly feel it 's better to try it before blind buying this is a huge bottle \( very elegant for gift giving \) which should last him a long time there are lots of reviews from cologne experts \( like basenotes \) that can answer any in depth questions about it 's composition of essential oils if you 're interested , i popped by there before selecting this fragrance \( he 's picky ! \) i ca n't really answer those questions personally , unfortunately ! highly recommended
5	love this nail polish i have worn it more times than not already and it is my go to color of the summer
5	good self tanning kits are hard to find but st tropez definitely exceeded my expectations ! it produces a nice bronze color that lasts for a couple days i have yet to experience any or unpleasant marks the only downside to this product is the length of the application process which takes about an hour i also recommended purchasing the applicator glove to avoid getting brown hands from rubbing the product in !
5	love this stuff ! it doesnt flake everywhere like some of the other products do it makes you hair look fuller it hides grays between colors it doesnt rub off onto clothes you want to make sure you get it on the roots scalp brush hair afterward to knock off extra and use hairspray it will look awesome and stay put been using this for 2 years now and tried several types before i found this if i was a prep per i would stock food , water , emergency supplies and this for the vanity side of me
5	what a fun and unique bright pink this color is thinner then the darker essie colors making it a lot smoother and easier to paint it 's not as neon as i thought it would be , however , it 's still a bright and fun color if you want true neon , i would recommend china glaze pink voltage instead
5	foaming cleanser i love this foaming soap i loooove soap , and foaming soap is even better it foams and lathers very great , and you feel soooo clean i just cannot tell you how good this cleanser is it is so good and i highly recommend it , especially to those of you who are like me and love foam but we all need soap cleansers , and this cleanser is even better than standard cleansers for those who know me , they know that i love fluff there is never too much fluff i would be cranky if i did n't have enough fluff in my life i love fluffy cozy , fluffy soap \( such as this foaming cleanser \) , whipped cream , fluffy , foamy
5	i have never tried a burberry fragrance other than magazine samples but this one intrigued me as i love crisp apple scents so i opted to try it out i love the sleek glass bottle that is easy to hold and the lotion dispenser is strong and targeted with no drips the scent is very different and it has green and sandalwood as a top note and then it brings in lemon , rose and apple with amber and musk with the dry down it is a spicy subtle addictive scent that men love and i let the ladies in my office try it and one of them went and bought a bottle for herself it is a unique scent that is great for a daily perfumed lotion as it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling silky and moisturized it would make a great gift !
5	i have some scaring on the top of my head due to skin lupus this has solved my problem it is easy to apply and no mess took it with me today when i got my hair trimmed and my stylist was very impressed i would highly recommend
5	love it , but , there are 49 ingredients in this ! only a couple are organic but some how my skin feels fabulous just using this a short time , i ca n't believe how soft my legs feel , and my body feels my legs have been so dry all summer , and i do use body lotion , but washing with this jack black , everyday , and using lotion , my legs are not dry , or old looking they even seem more firm ! ! \( i'm a older women \) the scent is not only for a man i'm a women , and love it it is not to strong , its kind of a citrus scent does not interfere with my perfume i think it is a bit pricy , but if it works this good , i'm buying it
5	even though this blonde pencil is a little darker than i expected , it 's worked out great for this blonde ! i apply it in small , light feathery strokes onto my very sparse brows and then use the spoolie brush to blend and slightly lighten the strokes for the past few years i 've used a well known brand 's wind up mechanical brow pencil that neither lasted long nor was very strong no matter how careful i broke regularly , wasting product i expect this pencil will last a very long time , so i consider the price reasonable yes , it 's more than drugstore brands , but less than many department store brands the color applies very easily and blends well it 's not too hard nor too soft , and fine pointed enough to make hair like strokes i definitely recommend this eyebrow pencil !
4	i was worried when i received the bottle that the color would be too dark based on the outside of the bottle but once applied , it went on nicely and the tone was right for my skin \( no line at the chin \) a little goes a long way and it did n't feel oily or thick once applied i typically use loose powder with my foundation and the powder nicely to it , giving that matte finish i seek of note is that it was very yellow on my skin not a golden yellow but a sallow yellow i had to add powder to knock back the yellow
4	worked well
4	my lips have needed some extra care lately and i'm not a fan of waxy lip balms , so i gave the yu be moisturizing skin cream a chance to work some magic on my dry lips i put a little bit of the magic yellow cream on my lips at night and wake up to lips that stay soft all day the cream goes on with a pretty strong camphor smell at first i did n't like it much , but i 've become used to it i would n't say that it dissipates quickly it takes 5 10 minutes unfortunately for me , my daughter has also discovered yu be and she often my tube for her own use her lips get very dry \( to the point of cracking \) , so if she 's stealing my yu be skin cream it must be really good ! i guess i 'll just have to buy another tube
4	this is a nice compact , it 's attractive and solidly built i really like the eyeshadows as they blend beautifully i found the large pan of black eyeliner to be especially nice it might be black shadow , but i used it as eyeliner with the small end of the brush and it was really easy to work with the shadows seem long wearing the blush was very natural looking the lip glosses were fine i'm not a big fan of lip gloss , so my opinion probably should n't count on that the pans remove from the compact very easily \( i just stuck a 00 needle in the hole , but i think a or pin would work just as well \) the pans appear to be held by magnets downsides the brush does n't fit in the compact ! i think this is just absurd there is n't even a carrying case for the brush , so do n't even think of putting this in your purse for an evening out you ca n't find replacement pans of eyeshadow i want to throw out the gloss \( not because it 's bad , but because i do n't like gloss \) and replace that with two more eye shadows , but i ca n't find replacement pans anywhere not on amazon and not on michelle phan 's site
2	this product has a nice smell and applies on gently but it 's supposed to exfoliate and make my skin softer after a winter in after several uses between me and my son , we did n't notice any changes i felt like using my loofah afterwards my son says it makes a good body wash now for the price holy ! 47 bucks \? i double checked several times to see if quantity 1 included a four pack no , it is only one and it is way overpriced if it was 8 at most , i would have given it four stars
5	this is a wonderful , class fragrance it has a nice spicy , wood scent i definitely recommend it
5	this moisturizing balm is the same great quality of all mustela products i have tried my infant son does have eczema and sensitive skin so i stick with mustela to stop the dryness and itchiness and this definitely works to keep him moisturized
5	very good moisturizer for sensitive skin that needs a lot of moisture like the container as it prevents bacteria from getting into the lotion excellent for winter months when one needs a little bit more moisture
4	i like this as an overnight cream in consistency it 's somewhere between a day and a night cream i find most night creams to be too thick so it 's just right for me it could be used as a day cream \( it absorbs pretty quickly \) but since it does n't have any spf , i wo n't use it for the day i do n't know about it 's ant aging effects since i 've only used it for a few days , but it has left my skin soft feeling there is a scent to it but not too much of one it 's one i associate with lotions i'm very pleased with it
5	my wife absolutely loved trying this product ! although i do n't know how these things price at the store my wife does when she saw it she said high end product and immediately grabbed it and her and my daughter went to the bathroom to test this product she said it applied to her skin near perfectly had a very soft touch and lasted all day long for her she made a point of mentioning the brush which was real nice and not cheap like some of these products are the compact itself rotates which is a good thing i was told would recommend !
5	this product give me the confidence to go out without wearing a hat i have been using this for over a five years , i was lucky my sister shared it with me i'm no longer concerned should someone take my picture from a a facial picture to one from behind if you have thin hair this is the product to use
4	this is a great tinted sun shield for those times when you are outside and need protection and are not in the water \( as it is not waterproof \) it goes on smoothly and adds a bit of color so can be used as a foundation if you are exposed to both uva and or uvb rays during your daily activities it is sheer so does n't provide a lot of coverage , but it is fragrance free and is meant to be hypoallergenic i had no sensitivity to it the main ingredient is zinc oxide , along with other common agents in sunscreens and blocks , which is what prevents penetration of rays and subsequent burning i imagine that everyone nowadays knows the importance of applying broad spectrum sun protection and all the other about exposure to the damaging rays just remember , this one is not for you to rely on when out in or on the water you 'll have to use another product then i 've used other obagi products in the past so am not surprised by the cost of this item it should last quite awhile if used appropriately
5	a lovely delicate scent , enough product for about two weeks if used sparingly there is a lot of confusion about what the products are and how to use them the descriptions , although brief , are on the bottom of the beautiful tin in which the products come boxed as these products cost 40 a piece , for the normal sizes , it is awesome to get enough product for two weeks to see what works i love the corrective care pot of cream it is superb i also love the body lotion great products , gentle and softly scented wonderful ! i am not a huge fan of micellar cleanser in general , so i could take or leave that also , the serum is redundant , you can use it under the cream , or by itself one product in the morning , one at night i would rather just , but i know that some people love layering their wrinkle solutions \) to save you some time , i 'll give you a brief highlight of each product within 10 days \( probably as long as this sample set will last \) you will see results
5	i 've been a long time fan of agave healing oil \( i love using it on my hair after i 've done a weekly deep conditioning mask to further lock in moisture and add shine \) , but i 've never tried any of their other hair care products so i was excited to try the shampoo and conditioner because i have another tried and true line \( davines oi \) i use regularly because it just works for my thick , coarse , wavy , color treated hair this set is especially great because specialty hair care products can be expensive and it sucks to buy full sized shampoo and conditioner only to determine you do n't like the results , scent or something else the shampoo and conditioner are essentially travel size \( though on the larger side of travel size \) , while the healing oil is the smaller of their two full size offerings trying this shampoo and conditioner i really like them the shampoo does a good job of removing the styling products i use in my hair , without stripping my hair of moisture and making it feel like straw the conditioner also does a good job of putting moisture into hair without weighing it down or over conditioning the scent is also soft and pleasant without being overpowering i still think the davines oi line gets my hair a tad softer and makes it feel a bit healthier , but this is still a really great choice i could see it being perfect for someone who has hair that is not as dry or color treated as mine i could also see this being a really nice gift for someone who likes nice hair care products would recommend
4	it 's as described a dark grey looks nice in the light because of the light shimmer it has two coats does the trick not a thick formula
5	it 's a jack black product what do you expect i read some reviews on the new and improved version but decided on this one as advertised it washes out easily and holds just fine ca n't go wrong
5	this spray is so comforting and cooling in humid weather simply spray a light mist on your face and you lose that greasy feel i really like using it mid workout if you hate that sweaty feeling on your face , this spray will refresh you enough for another half hour on the created with healing thermal water , known for its rejuvenating skin properties
5	i was n't sure how this makeup foundation would look on my face especially since there 's a darker side a lighter side that you twist to grind up and then mix together before applying to your face my present foundation just seems to disappear into my pores and it does n't even look like i have makeup on so i was pleasantly surprised that this foundation too looks absolutely natural i love it !
4	lots of glitter in this product , hard to remove and it gets caked on if you try to layer it more than twice
5	this citadelle by raw spirit is a wonderful scent unlike anything else i have tried in the past my first impression was that it was a light , powdery scent that was not in any way fruity or flowery \( which is a good thing \) beyond the initial hint of baby powder , there is a rich earthiness that i really enjoy it 's hard to put the scent into words , but truly powerful smells often trigger sense memories and that is exactly what i experienced here it instantly and powerfully took me back to an cruise i took nearly a decade ago , specifically the cool , woodsy scent i recall from the deck as we a narrow channel by trees and water it may seem strange to recall a specific memory like that , but that is what instantly came to mind when i tried this out what a wonderful scent to that very pleasant memory from my past if you enjoy smelling things like a forest in the afternoon , fresh , and cool mist , this would be a scent you would likely enjoy citadelle comes double boxed , and the tall thin bottle is beautifully simple and fragile i will this one fluid ounce bottle and use it on special occasions it is listed as unisex , and i suppose that is true the initial light powdery scent , however , may strike some as though the more powerful and lingering woodsy smoky scent lingers and it does have some masculinity to it overall , i am thrilled with this and would easily recommend for those willing to make a special purchase for quality and hopefully some pleasant scent memories
4	pros suitable for everyone since this is thermal water , it can even be used on babies helps moisturizer soak in faster leaves skin feeling refreshed and supple no scents or dyes one bottle lasted me through the winter cons i ca n't really tell if this is doing anything if i use this instead of my usual toner before moisturizing , does it add any benefit that i would n't already get with my toner \? this is a really confusing product to review i like it , and it feels nice , but i ca n't determine if using it has any lasting effect on my skin or if it is really more of a refreshing spritzer for a hot day this is why i ca n't recommend using it in place of your usual toner \( however , i have to assume using this is better than using no toner at all as it still helps moisturizer soak in faster \) i can definitely see using this on an airplane , however , where the stale air is drying and you 're likely to be tired also , an office setting would be appropriate as well
5	great hair serum ! makes my hair healthy and shiny ! smells great too ! this is the new so its now called organics and they changed their packaging to green bottles
5	this is somewhere between a lotion and a cream i was afraid this would feel too thick on my face , but it absorbed very well , and felt good on my skin i'm not sure how i feel about the sunscreen ingredients but it 's nice to have a spf moisturizer that does n't sit on top of my skin this really does n't have a makes me happy the price is good for the amount you get i recommend this product
5	i have found a significant difference on my skin since i started to use it my skin is not dry or flaky and is great for hair an face also
5	best body wash on the market
5	nice sweet color ! !
1	this is gray , not gray green , just gray not as described or pictured not eligible for return buyer beware
1	i have had nothing but problems with this polish it 's streaky no matter how many coats or how much seche top coat i use it 's super pretty and makes me sad that the formula is so crappy
4	this luscious cream is wonderfully scented with a floral smell it is thick and creamy and spreads well , although i did think it was a tad greasy for my taste i live in and my skin was very dry during the winter so this cream was perfect for me , now that it has gotten warmer i think it 's too much for me it leaves my skin soft , glowy and smelling fabulous i do n't think it has done much to reverse signs of aging because i'm not even 40 yet but my skin softness and dryness was improved noticeably through the winter i gave it a 4 star because the jar sucks big time , you have to use a spoon to get the product out and if it 's tucked in the upper rim , good luck that out for the price they could have design a better jar , lol
5	i love this multi use tool ! it is a nice small size for my handbag the knife is sharp , the file fine in a pinch , the scissors wo n't do a great job except for a thread pull or tag \( etc \) , but the clippers are fantastic they may be small but they work ! i would n't suggest for toenails , but they will work for a quick need for you or the kids and even a
5	great keep your makeup looking great all day product ! at first i was skeptical because this is a thick formula that felt greasy between my finger tips i do n't need any more grease when wearing makeup however , do n't let that keep you away because as you apply it \( and it disappears \) , it does n't feel like anything i applied my makeup \( foundation , powder , blush , etc \) it seemed fine it almost gave me a smoother base to apply makeup i felt my makeup was in place and less splotchy than without it usually 5 hours into my day i notice my makeup without the product has greasy areas and in some places my foundation looks different , or splotchy but i do not notice this at all when using blank canvas ! i worried about a break out with this because of the feel but did not notice any issues !
5	very nice
3	this was ok , my face felt soft after use but it was also looking kind of oily i do n't feel like it really did anything to help with my fine lines it has a nice light scent and i will continue to use this at night so it wo n't matter if i have some oil
4	there s gives a smooth finish without looking caked on or settling i the cracks do n't forget to set it with powder it has a thick but not tacky feeling
5	we are in fall in , not the best season to test this product but i tried this out on a sunny day \( 1 \) no negative harmful effects no rashes \( 2 \) good sun protection it is smooth and easy to apply
5	i love the vinylux polishes they definitely have lasting power ! ! ! i wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day i put it on ! the vinylux lasts about a week for me , which is amazing some of the polishes are a little clumpy like they are a little old but it 's ok decent price too !
5	gorgeous color , goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone very happy
5	love this ! ! helps to keep flare ups away dries out pimples blackheads without being harsh on skin
5	another fabulous vichy product the aqualia thermal mineral moisturizer is so light and cool to the touch it absorbs quickly so you can put makeup on almost immediately it leaves my skin feeling hydrated , soft , and plumped up i also use the serum once or twice per week and it is equally wonderful i have normal skin that is n't overly sensitive
4	i sometimes have an allergic reaction to one of the key medications i have to take bioderma helped calm the need to itch all over my body but especially my arms and face it acted quickly and though i still felt the impulse to itch at times a reapplication of this lotion mostly relieved that over time the lotion is scentless and works quick its of average consistency and works into your skin fast it has a plastic stopper which removes easily the first when you first open the pump style nozzle the stopper prevents leakage during shipping this is a large bottle at 16 7 fl oz
4	have n't tried it yet surprised at the terra color from the outside of the bottle , i thought it would be more muted as soon as i use it , i will report more objectively
4	i have always wanted to try these products so was excited to get this opportunity through vine i 've often wanted to cover a big shaving cut when i have to a summer wedding , or some other similar issue this does the job i plan to use it for such situations , although based on usage it seems that it would work very well on scars and discolorations or other issues people may want to cover from time to time great power
4	i love how this cream feels on my face and the fact that it sinks in and does n't make my skin shiny the dispenser is easy to use it takes a few pumps to get it primed but after it is primed you just push the button and there is the perfect amount of cream the price however , seems pretty high for what you get i will have to update my review when i see how long it lasts after having used this for a week i still love the cream but dispenser was a good idea that does n't work right i have to push it several times each use to get anything out it would be much better if it stayed primed
2	11 13 2014 much to my disappointment as this really is a rich and delightfully scented cream , i found a week or so into its use that it was making my eyes water , as in wash away eye makeup water i am unable to continue using it ! first impression review let me state right up front that this cream is fabulous it has a delightful fruity smell which , unfortunately , does not linger long after application no need to rub this rich formulation across your skin it literally glides on and a little goes a long way which is good considering the cost i have only used it for a few days so i ca n't speak to whether or not it has favorable effects on skin appearance , but i assume other reviewers speaking favorably on the subject are pleased with their own experience that said , i'm wondering about this proprietary fruit stem cell blend infused into a vitamin c , resveratrol rich formula business my understanding is that vitamin c serum on your face is good , and resveratrol is a worthy anti oxidant it took me awhile and a little creative searching on pubmed com to tap into the botanicals as skin research world after a fruit stem cell search on google resulted in little but cosmetic industry nonsense there is a lot of research supporting the dna qualities of plant derivatives , particularly those from green tea , , lilacs , and swiss apples all of which , apparently , are rich sources of and a lot of genetically to never grow hair spent a lot of time drinking green tea in their water bottles or having it slathered on their wrinkled , pink , hides before exposure to uv light to prove that green tea is a super duper protectant and of sun damaged dna and the application of lilac leaf stem cell derivatives to sun bathing of human skin cells growing in petri dishes uv damage to their dna in a satisfying sort of way human trials sunbathing with their hides still in place \? well there are n't any my conclusion \? botanicals are good , but buying a luscious expensive cream filled with fruity goodness of strength and benefits is a luxury that i probably wo n't on a regular basis i will , however , continue to drink a green tea , creepy green in color and faintly tasting of grass clippings based on an enormous amount of research evidence that green tea are good for my skin and all the rest of me too maybe i 'll even spring for a 14 diy instruction manual on making one 's own antioxidant skin cream
5	this cc has light coverage , amazing anti aging skin benefits with good clean organic ingredients like oils , , hyaluronic acid , anti oxidants etc shade warm glow is for light med skin w yellow undertone gives very pretty slightly tanned healthy complexion evens out texture in skin but doesnt create texture , it is invisible finish looks like skin , it is smooth and slightly glowy but not at all oily it doesnt accentuate lines , pores or peach fuzz you do n't have to set it i sometimes use loose mineral foundation on top for extra coverage sunscreen is mineral only , non nano it doesnt have any chemical uv absorbers now they added more shades , i think there are 5 my second tube , highly recommend
4	this is a really nice lipstick it applies well and stays on very nicely over the course of a day , through , family kisses , etc it is not inexpensive , but what italian product is \? this color shade 07 is sort of a deep mauve but with a definite red hue to it shade 06 is a more true mauve it looks velvety creamy once applied and is really a nice stick it does last all day and night long , much better than a more basic brand though , so between its look and its staying power , it may be worth the price to you
5	yet another great product with full coverage i got this in hopes i could use the shade to add some contouring i do n't recommend the product as a contouring product , but for a blemish cover full face coverage this will be perfect i do n't have the setting powder by dermablend , but felt my regular powder worked well
4	ive been using this for 7 days and nights it certainly makes the skin look more firm after application long term \? im not really sure maybe , but its a small change but i guess small change is better than no change i was surprised that it did not irritate my sometimes sensitive skin it is easy to apply and i forget im wearing it
5	i really love this stuff i did not need much at all , and i got the same effect as using my bed head wax very light not sticky i love that when i used my dry towel it came right off of my hands , it smells awesome it might be expensive , but it seems like it 's going to go really far and last me awhile i do n't really have anything bad to say about it
4	xen tan moroccan tan ultra offers an alternative to spray tanning for who need tan legs for \( e g , irish \) there are several steps involved , so if you do n't plan to read the instructions carefully and put in quite a bit of time and work , then this wo n't be a good choice for you i would n't go to these lengths on a regular basis but it would be fine for a special occasion \( e g , a job interview , a company , a wedding , a prom \) you will also want to make sure you get the application mitt it 's easy to see it as you apply it start on the light side the fragrance is not overpowering , which is another plus
5	this review is for , a purple green duochrome zoya was having a sale and i could n't resist this one it is unlike anything else i have i feel like it is a true duochrome \( and not just using the name to attract attention \) you can see the shifting between the green and purple in the bottle , but also on your nails depending on how i hold my hand with respect to a light source , my nails look either purple or green , with maybe just a suggestion of the other color it 's pretty cool and i ca n't stop looking at it ! formula wise , this is one of my favorite it did require three coats to become opaque , but it was super easy to apply it was not drippy and the brush was fairly narrow \( not wide like those nails inc brushes \) , which i felt gave me a good level of control it dried quickly \( helped along by some seche vite fast dry topcoat \) and has a nice shine and a smooth , even surface i 've had this on for about a day now and i do n't see any chips \( my nails are fairly short \) i did have to do a lot of cleaning yesterday evening and normally that would cause chips , but it did n't this time in the end , i like pretty much everything about this i'm going off to look at more zoya now !
5	this eyeshadow is really easy to apply and goes on very nice stays on for at least 8 hours without having to touch up
4	obviously the scent will be up to individual tastes , but in general the hair spray portion of this product worked well with a light spray , the hold was firm with still a bit of play when brushed , the hair still held the styled shape relatively well , but there were quite a few if you used a heavy spray , you would suffer from hair , ' and i did see some hair spray flakes after a while the scent , i'm not sure i would call tobacco , ' but rather a generic sweet with overtones of licorice being a pipe tobacco fan , i ca n't really say that i 've smelled specific tobacco that was similar , but i can sort of see how you might that a tobacco shop in general might smell somewhat like this scent when sprayed lightly , the smell was not overpowering and could be worn in conjunction with a cologne or other scent when used heavily , it does stand out and lasts quite a few hours
5	i decided to try the night firming cream since i 've been using for about 6 weeks after the pa at my plastic surgeon 's office said she swears by it i was n't a believer , but said i 'd give it a try in just a few days i can feel my skin is tighter after i put it on at night , and it has a lovely glow and shine to it so far i could n't be happier i highly recommend it !
5	i'm really impressed with this hand cream my hands get really dry and cracked in the winter and this works i put it on at night and do n't wash my hands again until the following morning it 's completely healed the more minor dry areas and has greatly improved the cracked areas my hands are much less painful than they were i do find that it 's not great to use during the day since it takes a long time to absorb but i do n't mind that
3	this is a convenient starter kit however , it is a bit time consuming to use the product i 've been using it for a short while , but have n't seen any difference to be fair , it is a product that claims to yield results over time i 'll keep using it and update this review if i see any changes
5	just had to add my vote to all the other reviews this really works and i too have found that it nearly completely healed a vertical split in one of my finger nails for years i had been polishing my nails and then had the bad habit of pulling the polish off the nail when it would start to chip then i used nail products like nail that only seemed to make it worse finally after all nail products for a while , i came to understand that even in their natural state the main problem was lack of moisture , not lack of hardness the first product i tried is nail , and that made a huge difference , used twice a day then i came across this and have to say i think it is even more effective the does moisturize the nails but the cnd leaves a very light protective coating i continue to use both products as often during the day as i can my nails finally look healthy , better than i can every remember them looking i will never use polish on them again
5	like velvet when you out on
2	i would classify this color palette as on the bold side it is advertised as it definitely leans toward dark sparkly out of the box i took an immediate dislike to the product it arrived in its black japonesque box , but there were no plastic seals at all no shrink wrap , no plastic over the makeup , no plastic , etc i have to knock it down 2 stars just because of that there also is nothing at all in the way of an applicator now , for decent better makeup that is not uncommon , but just a note to anyone who is buying this expecting an included applicator in total , there 10 colors , 16 4 grams the color palette itself is varied as far as color options there are four pro basic colors and four pixelated \( sparkly \) colors medium flesh tone lighter flesh tone cocoa flesh tone black pixelated silver turquoise lavender pixelated gray bronze pixelated purple obviously the colors have a good deal of sheen glitter properties to them the pro basic colors are more matte , but have some shimmer to them they go on nicely and are excellent for transition between colors if you like a more prominent , bold shadow look , you probably will like working with the colors this is definitely more of a weekend kit than a business work day eye shadow set the colors all apply nicely , but like anything strong or bold , less is more and a little goes a long way i see the shades as more accent colors than the base this is a decent set , but i could see younger people or those who go bold preferring it over someone looking for a more subtle look probably a 4 start product , but eye shadow with no plastic seal \? 2 stars
3	after trying several vita liberata tanning products , the last one i used had me raving with joy \( that was the fabulous self tanning gradual lotion the best self tanner i 've ever used \) i should 've stopped while i was ahead , because the body blur instant hd was a bit of a do n't get me wrong it gives a decent color , particularly on the legs \( my personal \) , although this was probably a bit dark for me i found the application streaky , no matter what i did and the idea of putting this on my face \? oh , no ! the real problem with this is that it rubs off i had this on my legs , hours before i went to bed , and it did n't feel tacky in the morning i woke up to sheets with tan colored smears , the product in the fibers i washed them immediately , but the stains remain well , at least i found something where this product sticks , cause it sure was n't my legs ! i wish i could recommend this more highly , but it 's a disappointment fortunately , the company 's fabulous self tanning gradual lotion is available on amazon drop this , and get that , you love it !
3	let 's start with the ingredients i see one review here that raves about 100 natural ingredients that he she can feel immediately when it hits the scalp that is not true far from it , in fact granted , the manufacturer makes no such claim , so i do n't know where this reviewer comes up with this i assume he can read since he was able to write a review ingredients are listed in order of highest content to least ingredient 1 is water it almost always is after that , there are 8 compounds listed that would require and advanced degree in chemistry to read , much less understand then we get to the peppermint , more , shea butter and such not a big deal just clarifying the shampoo conditioner is good it does n't lather as much as i'm used to , which is to be expected with a combo product , especially one sans the sulfates it has a pleasing , not overbearing scent and i do feel a slight tingle on my scalp after massaging it in , probably due to the peppermint it leaves my hair shiny as advertised my hair is relatively short so tangles are never an issue it does n't take much product to clean my hair , a couple of pumps is sufficient i do like this quite a bit , but it is very expensive i use jack black products religiously shampoos , shaving products , lotions , etc and i 've never been disappointed with their performance i 'll probably stick with their regular shampoo after this bottle is exhausted , mostly because of the price point if money is no object , i 'll say go for it if you are price conscious , there are alternatives available for less than half of what you 'll pay for this
3	this is a tinted lip balm that can be worn under your lipstick my wife says it does have s sticky feel at first that gradually goes away after being worn off a period of time she did like using it ok but for what it is , it is very pricey and works about the same as cheaper lip balms
1	the first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly wo n't let me return and i'm very disappointed i wo n't be buying polish off amazon again i usually love essie
5	i have been using this as my day cream during the , winter i can remember it keeps my skin moisturized , and i have n't had issues with chapped or rough looking skin it has a very mild , pleasant smell \( i hesitate to call it a fragrance \) it is tinted faintly blue , but it does n't look blue on your skin i have very fair , sensitive skin that tends to dryness , and this moisturizer is one of the best i have ever used it is thicker than most day creams , but i love that as i feel it provides a better barrier against wind and sun
5	this is one of the best liners i have tried
5	this is the first time i am trying vichy products and i think they now have a new fan this hydration cream is thick and rich but not greasy at all every bit of it absorbed into my skin and it really feels soft i could do without the fragrance in a face cream but it is a nice scent i always test products on my hands first , never knowing how my face will react my hands have been in and out of water all day yet still feel soft i do n't feel the need to reapply the jar is a little small for the price but you really need just a small amount and it lasts so long recommended
4	i have had good luck with all the products i have bought from the mario badescu line the texture is great and it hydrates the area around the eyes i would recommend this product
5	love this lip stain the only one i have found that does n't dry my lips out very pricy though
5	great neutral color , love it !
5	this is a very impressive texture cream the first thing i noticed was that it did n't leave any sticky feeling residue on my hands after application then , after my hair dried , i noticed how soft and manageable it was there was no crunchy feeling but yet no fly away hair either just a thumbnail size dollop was just right so the tube should last awhile
5	perfect light coverage foundation !
2	i love essie nail polish , but for some reason this one chips off very easily maybe it 's the shimmer
2	i have purchased mario badescu products in the past this seaweed cleansing soap , i did n't like the scent , i felt like i was putting a salad on my face , which i did n't like the little pieces in the cleansing soap , plus it really left my skin feeling clean , but overly clean , stripped , not feeling soft they say on the bottle that it 's suitable for all skin types , which is kind of subjective to me yes i want my face to feel clean when iam using a cleansing product , but i do n't like it feeling stripped this also left my facial skin looking red , which really surprised me not sure if iam allergic to an ingredient in it or not live and learn !
3	i had a hard time applying this cream foundation evenly on my skin once on , it does provide good coverage it just did n't feel creamy enough for me to apply easily and smoothly over my skin i do have uneven skin tone and bumps that seem exaggerated by the cream if not applied correctly i prefer dermablend 's liquid foundation much more
5	this product is exactly as advertised arrived promptly thank you great product !
4	good
3	the obagi sun screen felt thick on my face the scent was n't bad but my skin is dry and this felt dry on top i also had to rub fairly hard to get the cream to go in and that made my face feel a little sore it did keep my nose from burning and when i sweated it did not drip terribly into my eyes because i liked it okay but did n't love it , i had to take the price \( at this time \) into consideration and realized i would n't buy it
4	i love jane iredale products they smell delicious and are cruelty free the only thing that i do n't love is that they are often not durable part of the lipstick broke off in the tube after only a few uses this shade was a little more orange than i expected but it still looks nice on pale skin
3	be aware this is a new hydroquinone free formula and not the regular one from before my wife claims she can clearly tell the difference she started using t he obagi products many years ago and i will not complain about the results , as she easily looks 15 years younger than her age we had to start mail ordering the products because texas put strict standards on products with hydroquinone , thus cutting the number of available and hiking the amount you pay my guess is that obagi is starting to some products to avoid the in texas and perhaps other states she will not be re ordering this product unless she can get the real stuff i ca n't get much in the way of as to why it performs differently she simply claims it leaves her skin flat and dull compared to the previous formula
5	i love hour cool and smooth my face feels after i use billy jealousy 's shaved ice my skin does n't burn anymore post shave and i do n't have anymore red splotches it 's a bit expensive for an aftershave lotion , but feel it is worth it i 'd definitely recommend trying it as a part of your shaving routine
5	amazing neon pink that stands out and screams look how awesome i am ! perfect neon with the amazing essie quality
5	this lip gloss is rich and shiny , but the color is the exact color of my lips , so it 's very understated \( i'm a blonde , fair skinned caucasian \) there is no flavor , but the smell reminds me of cake somehow it 's not quite vanilla , but close anyway , it 's a great lip gloss with low color contrast for my particular skin tones i love the natural look it gives
4	i received this product from on the vine and ca n't say i 've noticed a huge difference yet and do plan on updating this review since i have only been using this product for a little over 2 weeks however , i do really like the consistency of this product as opposed to most serums most serums i 've tried are applied by a dropper and a consistency this serum is not runny but still goes on smooth and one pump goes a long way i also really love the fact that it 's organic and all natural i apply this in the morning and it only takes a minute or two to dry before applying make up i also use it after i wash my face at night and after i apply it , i feel like my skin is actually tightening it does make my face feel good and i do think that my face looks well hydrated when i put this on as opposed to not using it however , unless i see some major results by the time this container is gone , i ca n't really say i can justify spending the high asking price on this product unless there was some kind of money back guarantee
5	love the smell !
5	it is nice and refreshing ! love vichy !
4	this left my skin feeling smooth and younger i followed the instructions after washing and immediately felt a change i have used it for about two months now and really like it i ca n't be sure about how much it actually since the ingredients are not the best and if they were there 's no good way to tell , but i have felt my skin looks better and healthy looking it is kind of expensive to use constantly so i recommend using as little as possible and squeezing the tube dry at the end
1	i love bulgari it is a wonderful clean scent with just the right hint of manly spicy end notes this starts off with the same citrus notes with a little heavier lime but as it transitions to the floral and spicy undertones it loses some of the depth and staying power it quickly into just hints of sweet citrus 4 4 people could not tell difference between it and for first few minutes after an hour 4 out of 4 could and preferred bulgari as a scent alone i 'd give it 3 5 stars for this price and this staying power and for being a total bulgari knock off id give it 0 if i could
5	oh my goodness ! this stuff is absolutely amazing i 've struggled with acne for years and i tried this out last night , woke up today and no joke my red spots and acne have 80 my skin looks so much better after only one use i'm amazed finally something that actually works ! ! !
4	living in central with all the rain it took me awhile before i was able to try this product finally got a nice stretch of weather and i 've tried the hampton sun tanning gel a couple of times now i spray it on and sit in the sun for about an hour i have noticed that i get nice color , without burning , in that hour the gel feels nice if you like the feel of tanning oil this feels about the same i already had some base color before i started using this product i think if you have lighter color skin you might burn using this product if you do n't already have a base tan the gel smells nice also while overall i'm happy with this product , i would not pay the money they are asking for it as there are cheaper products that pretty much work the same
5	i have been using the shellac process for almost a year and my nails have never looked better recently i had to have surgery and remove all nail polish i was skeptical but did as advised i was amazed at how much healthier they look than they did before starting the shellac usage this top coat is the finishing touch when using shellac and a bottle will last a year doing your nails every ten days great product !
5	have never used this brand before but saw an instant difference in my hair ! softer and silkier i will purchase again !
3	it 's ok it leaves my hair very soft and smooth it 's not too pricey i'm just not crazy about using jars for conditioners too awkward and takes up space i do n't see any significant , visible brightening of my light auburn copper hair with this , but i do believe it my easily to fade red tones , so i do like that about it
4	i'm middle aged , with combination skin i tried this as a day moisturizer but did n't like it as well as my usual nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href trader joe s nourish antioxidant facial serum two pack dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 trader joe 's nourish antioxidant facial serum two pack a , which goes on less creamy and more matte i moisturize at night only once a week at most \( my bad \) , but as an occasional night creme , the vichy works great ! i am largely scent free in my laundry products to spare my friends with environmental sensitivities , but i confess i do love my facial products this one is noticeably scented , but i do n't mind it using it twice a day would be way too much moisturizing for me , so i 've set it aside for the occasional big burst from deeper application
5	the brush is loved by everyone in my family when my children come home for a visit the brushes seem to walk out the door with them when they leave ! they hold up to daily use for years my original brush is 12 years old and the handle is a bit worn with some of the white tips missing hope the company continues to keep making a great product
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
5	lovely color ! soft , pretty , slightly iridescent , more on the mauve side than pink great coverage
4	cleans well and removes makeup very well , smells a little , and leaves face a little tight feeling i do n't know yet if i will stick with it after initial purchase , it is a little pricey time will tell , but good as a makeup remover , but i would n't use it as my morning cleanse
5	my favorite liners are the liquid kind , and this one has made it to my list it is easy to apply , and dark it does n't smear , or run i have been using it for awhile now , and it is still dark and seems to have a lot left in it i like the liquid kind because they are easy to apply , and they go on dark , where some crayons are hard to get the pigment to show like it should the cap screws off , and contains the liquid liner the tip looks just like the picture this really is a great eyeliner ! so far , i love it !
5	i 've been using this product for two weeks and can see a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes and across my forehead it does n't have a strong odor and feels nice on my face i 've been using it at night before bed and when i wake up i do n't feel any excessive oiliness i plan to continue using vichy liftactiv for several more weeks my only complaint is that the packaging does n't come with any instructions it has an eye dropper for applications and i 've been using a drop in each of my problem areas
5	this is the best self tanning lotion i 've used while i'm not sure i would call it odorless , it does have a lot less of a scent than most cosmetics even other cosmetics that are unscented it goes on very easily not so thick that it requires a lot of rubbing but not watery , either as to the tanning effect , i am extremely fair skinned one application is enough to give me just a hint of a tan the next day if i use this product a few days in a row , it definitely looks like i 've been on a beach vacation i have n't used it more than than because i do n't want people to look at me and immediately know that i'm using a self tanning lotion i never get a dark tan because i generally use a lot of sunscreen and avoid sun exposure due to my tendency to burn
1	broke out
4	good and feel soft
5	we love the jack black line my husband normally uses the all over wash on his hair and happily agreed to try this it is similar in affect , in that it leaves his hair clean , freshly scented and moisturized , which he needs since he does n't use conditioner he washes his hair at least 5 x 's a week and this does not dry out his hair i do believe it is largely due to the removal of sulfates the tea tree is a nice addition , promoting hair health growth it 's hard to comment on how well this thickens since my hubby has short hair , however his hair does look great this would be a product that he probably would n't buy for himself , but i would buy for him during holidays
5	this product is like getting your hair conditioned in a salon calmed down the ends and made my hair shine and show off all the different highlights that my stylists had put in last time my hair feels soft , shines and is very easy to style great product for colored hair
5	love it ! a new most important in my make up line up !
5	great ! i no longer have to go to the nail salon thanks !
5	love this room spray always getting compliments
5	this polish is less like a pink and more like a skin color , which i guess can be pink based on the color of skin a person has i really like it and think it 's pretty the shipping was quick the polish was not goopy
5	works well !
3	like other jack black products , i love the feel and aesthetic i love it 's whipped creamy texture but currently , i'm using proraso soap and my shaves are just fine the supreme cream was n't any better in fact , the proraso gave me a smoother shave perhaps this is a good option for people with sensitive skin or particular needs but i do n't notice the difference
4	what a box ! this is great for new parents or those that are still learning a year later we are still using a lot of these toiletries on our little one and it 's great to know we have some in reserve , thus we are not going to run out and have to bundle baby up to go to the store yet again the items are in the box very securely and it 's such a great box to keep little and in that you do n't feel like you can part with anytime soon
5	i never liked browns , but i love this color ! it 's called take it outside ! great for fall , winter and spring formula is nice , goes on smooth , shiny , and lasts a long time ! the darker color on other fingers is chinchilly by essie which is nice too
4	my skin color more accurately matches the linen shade of dermablend , but i gave this natural beige a try , just to see what the coverage was like instead of setting powder , which is recommended by dermablend , i used infallible pro glow powder in nude beige i liked the results the combination did lessen discolorations of the skin but it 's hard to keep from inadvertently rubbing off the makeup over the course of a day but for a temporary solution , this cover creme is a good choice as to ingredients , it 's nice to see that i recognize the first three mineral oil , talc and beeswax and the spf 30 sunscreen is titanium oxide
3	this is a very thick very rich moisturizer specifically formulated for night time use i must admit i did like the subtle floral smell my wife liked it even more in the dry months of winter this should come handy you can apply obagi hydrate luxe in the evening to combat skin dryness overnight to make your skin feel soft but not greasy at all little bit of researching this product 's success on the web revealed that one of the ingredient called as which is derived from the which people in know about for ages and it is known to be a potent moisturizer it is known to reduce skin water loss and have a rich moisturizing effect on the skin if you love thick cream types of moisturizers and learn to apply using very little cream and spread it around you will find this adequate enough to combat dry skin so , why three stars \? 1 the acrylic jar which holds the cream while looks cool seems to dry out the cream as it does not seal properly if the top loose piece of plastic is removed 2 yikes ! it is very expensive for mere 48 grams of cream me to rate it with 3 stars ! side note buying directly from amazon \( which clearly says shipped and sold by amazon \) ensures that you get a genuine product , buying from third party amazon market place is always questionable since these are not controlled by amazon and that is where the counterfeit products which are cheaply made the market i always have trust when products are purchased directly from amazon cheers !
5	i'm a guy , and i love this stuff bonus points for being able to use it as a shampoo and body wash it really makes you feel awake and refreshed when you use it , like a fresh pine forest but not a gross air freshener after all , this is philip b it 's legit amazon has the best prices too , so no need to keep shopping big bottle will last you a while too
4	i'm not a huge fan of putting just any old sunscreen on my face , so when i tried obagi sun shield tint broad spectrum spf 50 sunscreen , i was a bit skeptical not only because it 's sunscreen , but it 's tinted as well i'm pleased with the results it did n't have any negative effects on my skin and the tint was just enough to give my face a nice even look it protected the way i like and i did n't get a sunburn something that i have to watch i'm quite pleased with the overall performance of obagi sun shield sunscreen , but am a bit hesitant to buy it again because of price it performs about the same as neutrogena did for me , but the only difference was the tint something i can do without
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	this is an amazing tool for skin cleaning , after years of trying scrubs and masks , this does the job in a few days , with twice a day use , my face is exfoliated and glowing i use a very mild soap and once i use a facial cleanser it has three speeds , and feels deceptively like nothing much is happening wrong , it really gets the top layer off works well in shower for arms and neck and back cons , the button is right where you handle the , esp in the shower , easy to turn off the other is really weird on the charger at 4 am the entire thing lights up like its calling home , has me up for the last three nights , its really bright !
4	seriously , i love the smell of this hairspray it 's fantastic i know the fragrance is called sweet tobacco but it definitely does n't smell like cigarettes to me , it smells like old spice cologne with good pipe tobacco clearly scent is a subjective thing so your mileage may vary but i love this stuff it comes in a very masculine looking can , which may or may not matter to you however , even the most manly man wo n't mind having this out on his bathroom counter the hairspray itself is what i would call a light hold spray it once and your hair wo n't be stiff and it will be held in place for the day in indoor conditions you 'll need to spray it again and maybe even 3 times to get the kind of hold that will stand up to windy conditions and even then , this wo n't give you helmet hair since my guys prefer a light hold , this is great for them and all of the men in my family really like the smell i suppose a woman could also use it but the scent is decidedly masculine i'm focusing on the scent because that is really the only reason to pay this much for a can of hairspray this is more than 4 times the price of the brand we normally use so it 's not something my guys will use on a daily basis but for date night or a big event \? think of it as cologne that keeps your hair looking good
5	it does what it claims ! !
4	i 've been using this about 2 weeks , so not really long enough to notice any anti aging effects i 'll update later on that so far , though , i have n't found it to be irritating \( i use it every other night \) , and it feels good on \( not too greasy \) and seems to absorb nicely
5	i have mature skin , so cleansers need to clean my skin without over drying it this one works beautifully the first thing i noticed as i dispensed the cream into my hand was the scent light and very pleasant , slightly floral i do not care for scented skin products usually , but the scent is so gentle that it felt more like aromatherapy than something perfumey the cream foams up a little and rinses easily my skin afterward feels clean , smooth , soft and not tight i 've been using it each evening for several days now , along with the vichy toner and my skin has been looking pretty darn good for a 59 year old this is a product i will happily continue to buy !
5	i generally like burberry fragrances , both the ones marketed for men as well as those marketed towards women it was with high expectations i looked forward to trying out the brit rhythm aftershave balm as for the fragrance , well , it is a clean , inoffensive scent , that is , it smells very nice , but it is completely there is nothing that really stands out about the fragrance at all this is not a bad thing like one might assume , however , as there are many times when this type of scent is preferred over anything else as for the properties of the balm itself , i am extremely happy with its performance it is a nice consistency that is neither too thin nor too thick it smooths into the skin readily , leaving it feeling soft and moisturized there is no greasy feeling with this balm it does a good job of soothing razor burn without stinging or burning upon application so my verdict \? use it for the excellent aftershave balm that it is it is a good inoffensive fragrance for those who work in close quarters with others it is least likely to cause others to wrinkle their noses in
1	essie nail polish usually impresses me , but this polish does not last more than a couple days i would be very surprised if it was real essie
5	i have tried many spf lip balm in the past and this is the first one that i can actually say that i like and that i continue to use it has a nice moisturizing balm feel to it and you do n't see the tint or any color once you put it on , though in the tube it looks like a dark tan it does n't have a ton of sheen , so i can use it above my top lip where i have melasma and it does n't get all shiny or greasy i just tap or rub it in a little in that area and it 's just as good as using a regular sunscreen there it 's not as dry or matte as most of the other sunscreen balms i 've used and that 's one of the reasons i like it so much it actually softens and moisturizes your lips while using it it is light and smooth and gets the job done perfectly sort of amazing with such a great spf level
5	romantic color ! ! very nice
4	ive said it before , and ill say it again ive gone through my share of expensive clarisonic products for skin cleansing , and i mean , gone through plenty of them , and they leave me with the feeling of being ripped off since id find them non after a year or so plus , the who invented them are in the money if they 're not breaking , you have to refill the heads of brush bristles ive also tried some cheaper fake knockoff models of clarisonic , but found those to be just another waste of money a couple of years ago , i discovered a much more frugal alternative , the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href solo mio sonic face cleanser and massager brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 solo mio sonic face cleanser and massager brush a nbsp and found it to be an effective face cleaning instrument recently , ive had the opportunity to try nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href foreo luna face exfoliator brush and silicone cleansing device for sensitive normal skin pink dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 foreo luna face exfoliator brush and silicone cleansing device for sensitive normal skin , pink a , and though its pricier than solo , it is larger , and the device has the added anti aging feature , which at my age is more of a necessity than a perk ! i also ordered the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href foreo luna mini silicone face brush with facial cleansing for all skin types petal pink dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 foreo luna mini silicone face brush with facial cleansing for all skin types , petal pink a nbsp , and found it to be perfect for my daughter who needs a gentle but thorough cleaning for her sensitive skin , which , on occasion , has acne breakouts she uses it once in the morning and once at night and loves how it cleans deep into her pores and removes impurities without leaving her skin dry i can definitely see the difference on my daughters face her face appears much smoother and softer ive had some charging issues with my with my foreo product and found the device doesnt hold its charge however , we have not found this to be the case with the foreo luna mini silicone face brush we find the device holds its charge well
5	gorgeous , deep color that looks great on all skin tones nice consistency and great shine another example of color and quality from essie brand great price from company , too
5	this product give me the confidence to go out without wearing a hat i have been using this for over a five years , i was lucky my sister shared it with me i'm no longer concerned should someone take my picture from a a facial picture to one from behind if you have thin hair this is the product to use
5	i really love this thermal water ! it feels best as soon as i wake up i spray onto my face and my face just feels so great i also can spray throughout the day and spray onto a cotton piece and use for a final sweep after removing my makeup with my cleanser there is so many uses for this water and it can even be sprayed over makeup \( and does n't disturb the way my makeup looks or as set \)
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
3	makes me break out and turns my face into an oil slick , i have very sensitive skin and a lot of products do this a lot of reviews stated better experiences than i had but this was mine my wife likes it and uses it regularly
5	this perfume is definitely a winner my wife has used primarily softer perfumes in the past by estee lauder , beyond , etc but she really likes this one endless euphoria is stronger both in terms of length of time it lasts on the body and in terms of intensity of smell but it is not overpowering and has floral tones that soften the stronger sandalwood and musk i also really like it on her this is a perfume that can be worn in any season but can take the heat of summer , i think it will be a winner for women who like floral perfumes that have a full bodied , long lasting sense to them
5	do n't let anyone tell you it is just water this is different i received a small sample bottle in my monthly allure beauty box and i loved it the thing that really sold me was that after i used it a few times a day my skin was soothed and so much clearer ! it relieved me of clogged pores and my skin is perfect i had heard that the chemicals and deposits from hard water can irritate skin and i am a believer now i mean i would never have believed it had i not experienced the difference with my own eyes for the record , evian and other sprays are not avene , this is truly a special product ! update why anyone feels this review was me i would think a to it 's ability to sooth and calm skin to the point of clearing up clogged pores in some individuals would be a useful bit of information obviously , if you have no sensitivities it would not be a point of concern , but it is still to the uses of this product and to be honest i did n't realize i had sensitivities to the hard water where i live until i began using avene personally , i use a daily aha bha product as the last step of my night time skin regimen and rather than use tap water to neutralize it , i spray my face with avene and pat dry there has been a big improvement in the clarity and overall appearance of my skin another added bonus i 've found is that when i use this on areas where i'm prone to psoriasis before using moisturizers or medicated creams it seems to somehow increase the efficiency of the other products and amount of time in which the affected areas clear up lastly , avene is very refreshing \( as any water spritz probably would be , but this does n't have calcium or other irritants possibly found in tap water and has additional soothing properties not found in distilled water \) and it is great for de mattifying makeup after setting it with powder if you prefer a more natural finish
4	i have been using this for several days now and i quite like it although we have had a mild winter , the air is still dry and my skin gets dry and flaky within just one application of this , i felt like my skin was softer , more , and just healthier there is no greasy residue and a little goes a long way , so this container will last you quite a while i am really liking this cream a lot !
4	i always struggle with mascara and eye liner bleeding down from the lower lid to wipe , wipe at it , add foundation or concealer to hide what wo n't come off , etc this product works pretty good for the problem many older gals like me with age thinning skin will love this rather than all that tugging and pulling using other methods i feel a great product to have in your makeup kit
4	this is a really unique fragrance i think that it is definitely appropriate for men and women it mixed with my body chemistry well , but i think that it is better to spray it on my clothes because it does n't alter the fragrance and it lasts longer the only reason why i did n't give it five starts is because i found that it does n't last very long this is one of the nicest fragrances that i have ever had and i would recommend for everyone to check it out
5	great color
5	buy directly from pca
5	great nude pink shade definitely for daily wear
4	you do n't use a lot of the base coat at one time but , it keeps for a long time even the small bottle is good for a bunch of manicures
4	i really like this ! ! it leaves my face so smooth ! it works really well feels so good to remove dead skin great ingredients high quality product
4	i 've tried 4 micellar cleansers in the last few months and i'm on board , after assuming the were nothing more than overpriced water they really do remove makeup and cleanse in one easy step this one has a mild almost undetectable fragrance , which is a big plus it left my skin clean and moist , no drying \( i have combination skin \) all the micellar cleansers i 've used perform similarly , so based on price this would not be my first choice
5	beautiful colors by opi infinite shine collection
3	did n't notice a difference between this and cheap drugstore brand eye creams i like that it 's organic , but for the price , i 'll pass
5	i love this concealer stick a little bit goes a long way you just dab it on and then blend after , i put my bb cream or foundation on top for a smooth look and end with some powder this stick really helps to make my skin look clearer and brings down the red overall , i am a big fan
3	pro whitens and brightens my natural nail tips looks really nice by itself con bright nail tips really show through color polish and look horrible horrible pro quite a good basecoat keeps polish firmly in place and makes nails strong while in use con it really does n't fill in ridges very well it does make nails somewhat smoother but nothing to write home about additionally , my bottle is gloopy and it tends to pool on the sides , making my polish colors uneven yeah , i'm not really impressed with opi ridge filler i'm going to stick with my nail envy
4	i 've tried the oil cleansing method a few times but my skin just really was n't a fan and went back to a traditional cleanser i decided to give it a go again with juice beauty and see if perhaps this was the time that would make all the difference it is ok but i really feel like my traditional cleanser is still doing a better job for my skin \( ymmv \) however , i have been using this to remove makeup and other than stubborn mascara it does a great job so i am going to continue with this method and follow this up with my traditional cleanser this may work for others but for me using it as just a cleanser was n't a total win
5	wonderful product i must say skinmedica 's new product delivers ! softer , supple skin and a little lift , if that 's possible i'm impressed
1	awful color ! !
4	to give this a bit of perspective , my favorite scents are all the sweet ones channel 5 is a great favorite if you love that , you wo n't love this if you think that 's too flowery , too girly , not right for today 's woman , you may well adore this it 's not at all like a normal perfume the initial impact , when it as its strongest , smells like it 's horrible after a few minutes that fades and you get a kind of spicy musk , almost like a feminine variation on a man 's cologne then you get the more subtle layers of sandlewood and spice it is a very sophisticated , very different scent it takes a bit to get used to i would not this at an important event try it first , because it is not for everyone and definitely give it time to settle down before going out in public with it i would give it five stars but for the first few minutes after putting it on i know perfumes are always a bit overwhelming initially , but this was far worse than i 've ever experienced before
5	i ordered do n't me around it 's not the color i was expecting in yellow light it 's a creamy brown and in bright light it almost has a lilac tint to it however , application was flawless totally opaque and beautiful with a single coat
5	this stuff is really amazing it removes dirt that other cleaners leave behind i tested this many times in , but time and again , this cleansing water just pulls out more dirt from my face after washed it every other cleanser i have my skin has never looked so healthy , natural and glowing after each treatment my blemishes have lightened and evened out on my face it seems my acne wounds heal much faster using this to clean my face i am in love with this stuff and will be buying big box of it to take with me to se asia when i move there to live i have another micellar water bottle that i had to review earlier , and i tested this product against that one and still this one pulled out more stuff from my skin the cotton pad was brownish , and i thought , hey maybe it 's just does that every time , even on clean skin a chemical reaction , perhaps \? but nope i used it a second time and it pulled out nothing more anyway please try this , and i'm hoping you 'll have the same experience as me i swear by it now my daily regimen is to first wash my face with cetaphil , a gentle cleanser then i proceed with cleaning my face with a cotton round and a few shakes of this product i squeeze out the excess before to wipe down my face , flip the pad and repeat then i toss it out , and rinse my face with plain water , as i do n't like the cleanser on my face even \( though i 've left it on before with no issues other than a tight sensation \) it 's just do n't like how my lips taste \( a bit bitter \) , and i prefer to have absolutely nothing on my face before hitting the
3	i was surprised at the size of the cleanser , it is a very generous size ! though i have heard of the brand before i was not sure if it was meant more for the male market yes , skin is skin but males generally have tougher skin that is more oily and has more follicles so they need something a little stronger on the other hand i have really dry skin so i need something really moisturizing the pump squirts out a bit of product which is just right for my morning cleanse \( i only used one pump \) , it does not foam up which i really like as i find foaming cleansers \( with the exception of fresh 's foaming cleaner \) really drying on my skin it washed off very easily \( no soapy feeling yay ! \) which i also liked as there was no unnecessary tugging action on my skin i did not apply moisturizer after using this cleanser for the first few times to accurately judge whether it was working for me unfortunately though my skin felt really soft and smooth after the wash , i experienced the horrible tightening and dried out feeling around half an hour after washing i will be passing this on to my husband who has oily skin and hopefully it will work for him
5	when i ordered these resurfacing pads through vine i did n't realize they were for men i will say they are perfect for women too in just a couple of weeks i saw definite results in the firmness of my skin and i only used the pads about three times a week so you might see results in as little as six uses the pads are also slightly abrasive so they seem to remove dead skin while applying the peel ingredients i also have sensitive skin and the ingredients did n't seem to cause any irritation i used the pads at night before going to bed and they seem to work great i think this is a safe way to use glycolic acid i also noticed my skin was clearer than normal after a few weeks of use i put these in my shopping cart as i definitely want to buy more when i run out the rebecca review p s i looked at my skin today and thought something was different what i finally realized is that my pore size has significantly reduced my skin is starting to look like porcelain if you know what i mean i'm so impressed
5	awesome fall color ! ! ! !
5	need a gentle cleanser \? this is for you ! i struggle with very oily skin and use strong cleansers this was a good alternative for the day off in between strong cleansers , and would be fabulous for anyone with delicate skin it foams gently and has a light fragrance , but it cleanses well
5	fashion styles come and go , and trendy is a term applied to those who can generally ill afford to follow but there are products that can be helpful , especially health and beauty products for men \( who generally do n't use much as a rule and we 're speaking of average men , not urban \) this is a men 's product , made for men , and made to help men who wear facial hair proudly even us aging men with beards and can benefit from using this product especially older men , whose skin tends to dry out more rapidly and who benefit from moisturizing a concept rarely at an early age unless with a dermatological condition although labeled oil , ' this product mainly benefits the skin beneath the beard \( although it does help the hair and follicles \) the smell is manly , a cedar and \( i think the italian screwed up on the packaging text and really meant \) blend that can also a light cologne or aftershave while beard oil was popular in the pre depression era in america , its time has come again men are being men again , and wearing beards this means your face and the skin under the beard on your face needs a bit more attention treat it right use this beard oil it 's great stuff but proraso fix the typo on the packaging and as a consumer , i'm glad to see that you sell this product with a safety seal good job !
5	this is aptly named amazing base it really is amazing how well this powder covers usually you need a base or foundation and a powder to get full , even coverage , but not with this powder it is very light and does n't feel cakey and covers like you have on several products instead of just powder i am a huge fan of this product
4	this concealer is awesome , it covers my dark circles nicely i have an in color that works well year round it certainly stays put , even in hot weather the only thing i did n't care for was that it still encourages my mascara to smudge a bit the old dermablend \( in the pot \) did n't do that , it kept me from having raccoon eyes my eyelashes are a bit long on the bottom , so i tend to have that problem with many concealers i 'll be looking for the old version instead \( if they still make it \) , especially to wear in the summer or in humidity in the winter , or will try ben or joe and use this concealer elsewhere on my face
5	my fianc immediately tried this item as soon as i gave it to her here is her review the feel and texture of this primer was so smooth and glided evenly on my skin even with my dry skin , it showed no dry patches at all ! it was like starting on a smooth , clean palette ! after applying my foundation , it almost had an airbrushed finish i would recommend this to anyone and everyone ! definitely worth the price
5	my wife loves this stuff so i picked her up some more while getting a few other things smells really good and works great too
5	does n't feel greasy makes the skin feel good and smooth i found it has a faint , pleasant scent , not strong at all my wife likes it as well note it 's meant for dry hands , so do n't use it on your lips or other sensitive parts
1	i would give this zero stars formula is very watery something is not right with it i will be returning very disappointed for an opi product
5	perfect purse size compact for fresh ups during the day and fits into an evening bag too they should have darker color ranges
3	i have been using this product for about a week now and i am impressed with how clean my face feels after using it i cannot really speak for any other benefits , other than a clean , tingle , feeling similar to a toner after use i do have sensitive skin , and this product has not led to any breakouts or increased redness but i cannot really speak for any other noticeable benefits one obvious negative to this cleanser , is that it does not remove eye makeup very well given that the product is sold as a makeup remover , this aspect falls flat it does also appear to be quite pricey for what it is given these facts , i am considerably less likely to purchase this product again
5	i prefer lightweight foundations on the sheer side , and this fits this bill really nicely this has wonderful coverage it looks as though you 've used a primer underneath it also goes on easily , blends in without creating lines , and stays on \( i use a foundation brush , which i believe works better than anything else \) my only complaint is that it is hard to tell which color to get by just looking at the photos my skin color is fair and cool , but i usually go slightly darker to avoid looking like a ghost i got the sand color which is unfortunately a bit too dark and warm toned for my just from winter skin color i am pretty sure the color will work in the summertime when my skin gets darker anyway , but for now i feel i with the color i wish there was a better description of the colors or underlying tones two others that i like quite a lot and can compare this to are clinique 's even better glow and lumene 's instant glow beauty serum lumene 's is thinner consistency and than this , which is more like the clinique product the sand color is similar to clinique 's honey , if that helps anyone
5	this is a good hairspray ! i think it 's great they make one targeted toward men , and it 's a good quality my best guy friend uses it , and he really likes it it has a good scent to it , it does n't smell girly or anything overall , i was happy with it and i 'd recommend it
5	good head camo
3	the color is a bit darker than what i expected and i feel like it is a fake essie bottle , because it is different from what i bought in cvs
5	been using this stuff for years and works very well !
5	i usually do n't write reviews on shampoo and conditioner but i felt to after using this product my hair is thin but i have a lot of it and heavy blond highlights which is alittle past my bra strap i'm growing it out alittle more i have been hooked on lanza healing oil shampoo and conditioner for 2 years now but after a recent visit to an upscale salon store i cringed at the price of this but figured it was worth a try for my hairs sake ! this is truly a gem combined with the conditioner my hair feels light and airy like when i have the salon blow it out it smells amazingly fresh my hair is soft and styled really great ! this is expensive stuff but it 's well worth the price of looking like i just got a blow out every day ! ! ! i ca n't wait to see the long term effects of this product !
5	in case you all took a different language requirement in school , jouer is french for to play i like this name for this company , and find it appropriate there has been a lovely playful vibe to every one of their products which i have been fortunate enough to try , so far however , quality wise , jouer does n't kid around it makes good make up ! how do i know \? because i prefer to use good make up and recognize it i am hip to makeup which is first rate , i like to think it is so great to see what effects you can achieve with this particular product , jouer luminizing moisture tint in golden it is a bit like a bb cream , a bit like a foundation , but if you are a makeup lover , you will see , as i did , that it is actually so much more than only that i took my shower this morning and primed to try this out only with a very simple moisturizer i really wanted to start from the ground up to see how this performed however , i did n't want to use this as the base moisturizer , as i am extremely fair skinned i decided that it would be too strong a tint if i chose to use it as moisturizer base alone so i focused on its feature as a luminizing tint i was correct in guessing that i would need to start with plain old moisture first the reason i say this is that when i applied the jouer luminizing tint in golden i saw such a difference in my face it was a bit of an overkill however , after i took a cloth and patted some of it away a bit , the effect was stunning ! so what i am saying is this definitely try this if you love makeup and like looking pretty just do n't overdo it if you have fair skin i am also adding that i especially like the gorgeous blending aspect which jouer luminizing moisture tint in golden has , even if i did overdo the applying the first time and had to pat some away your face will look like you do not have a single wrinkle or a that alone is something i rarely say , especially when i am talking about myself and my face so i do encourage you to try this i love it ! effectively , i just needed to go easy on the application and use a light hand , i repeat i started from the neck up and covered my whole face with the tint by gently applying it with my fingers and palms after rubbing my hands together when i had put what i originally thought would be the right amount on one of my palms so far it has lasted all day ! i am going to be attending a school in a few weeks , and my jouer is coming as my why \? because it makes me look that good , now that i have figured out how to use it \) i am with jouer ! you will be with jouer as well , i bet ! i do hope you like it as much as i do ! it is a great boost for a fresh spring and summer look , alone and or with other added makeup you might want to try when you are in the mood to look totally drop dead gorgeous ! thanks , jean note the way i applied it , after a steamy shower , and by using that other moisturizer first , did cause a bit of a stinging sensation this stinging feeling dissipated rapidly i think my pores were really open from the shower and my whole face was a bit sensitive the next time i apply jouer luminizing moisture tint i am going to prep a different way , washing my face thoroughly but ending with cool water , then using a light oil or serum , and then applying the jouer tint i think this will solve the stinging problem which i believe i caused myself by jumping in too !
4	loved this when i first started using it , does give a lovely glow to the skin i have recently stopped using it however because i think it accentuates the lines on my face \( in my mid 50 's \) the colour range is a bit strange , i was using the no 7 which is a tad too dark \( very yellow \) so bought no 5 which is a tad too light \( more pinky \) so ended up mixing the two i think this would be great on younger skin i think the problem is with its very thick consistency which i have found makes lines worse
2	going on 3 weeks and this has n't done a thing it actually seems to have made my acne worse i kept using this , as directed in hopes that it was just because it was a new product i 'd definitely consider something else i have combo skin , 33 years old buy some stridex red box and save the money
3	this beard oil really does soften a beard after a few days use it made a huge difference in my beards softness what i do n't like about i is the scent it is pleasant but i do n't like fragrance in my hair care or skin care products , and it is a very heavy fragrance
5	great color !
3	bright , pretty color
5	love the color
5	jack black is designed for men , but can be used by women as well the mint adds a touch of cool and the shea butter provides moisture the balm stays on well after burning my lips badly while on vacation , i was on the lookout for a balm with as high an spf as possible this produce has spf 25 , so should help prevent future burns
5	i 've been using the proraso line for a while now , they pretty much only make the one cream and a couple others similar to it but yeah , i really like how it makes my face feel after a shave and also how it is so quick to lather up with even a halfway decent brush i like the tubes of cream more because they just seem to lather faster than most of the tubs of cream , those tend to need a little more work
5	highly recommend as a full body wash as indicated even my wife likes it ! !
5	good
3	i like the texture but i usually wear medium which this said it is and it is sooooo light like i said , the texture is soft and smooth and covers well , i just wish it was n't so darn light then it would be perfect
5	wonderful color , true to photo !
5	i love essie for the quality and colors and i love that amazon often has a good price pleased with my polish
4	this is nice , and works well makes your skin soft as an aftershave it has a perfume smell that i do n't like , my wife did though it also did n't give you the cool fresh feeling after shaving i do like that it is n't a solid liquid and you skin feels nice after , but the price and smell to me , make it a four star item
3	good product for up fine hair , but bottle when i opened it and powder went everywhere i lost a lot of powder as a result bottle was packaged well , but not something that should be sold thru the mail i'm surprised no one else mentioned this in the review
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
4	i 've tried quite a few lip and cheek combination products lately , and usually i find that they look good on the cheeks or the lips , but not both this is the first product that really works for both , i think it 's a light pink but it shows up on my cheeks \( it 's pretty pale \) you can get away with using a little or a lot , and you wo n't look like a clown if you use a lot \( i was almost late to work one day experimenting with a similar product last week , when i had to wash my face and start over again , so this is an important consideration ! \) it 's a faint color on my lips , and not too much of a shine , but good for a sort of enhanced natural look as a cheek color , it 's fairly long lasting as a lip color , you 'll have to reapply it after it 's not the most moisturizing lip color i 've ever tried , but it 's not the worst , either i 'd put it somewhere in between , which is actually quite good for a combination product it 's not a stain , though , and i do n't really feel much in the way of plumping effects what i like are the color and the convenience of having a product that actually works on both lips and cheeks
5	this is very pleasant to use it has a light fragrance and feels like a gel moisturizer going on you simply wet your face then apply one or two pumps i use a bamboo baby washcloth to then wipe the product off it takes all the makeup and grime off without any oily feel at all it does n't burn my eyes whatsoever it 's like a very wet gel it only takes 1 2 pumps to clean my face and it does a very good job of my mascara off it really makes me feel a bit spoiled i normally have used makeup remover wipes but this leaves my skin feeling even cleaner and smooth this is a product that i will continue to use
5	my favorite has been since i was a teen a must have in your beauty routine d
3	great container pump style for ease of application and distribution and product a little will go a long way ! tends to leave a bit of a greasy residue feel , so use at night has made it less annoying results are good , but has taken several weeks of continued use to notice a minimal reduction in fine lines and bags under eyes may not purchase again since a daytime moisturizer , especially for dry summer months , may be more beneficial
5	so i am mid thirties , pale complexion , sensitive with a relatively clear complexion i like this make up remover to cleanse my skin fast and efficiently did n't leave my skin too dry , and i did n't have a residue left behind
5	great
5	very nice product ! my husband is so happy about it says it leaves his face feeling so nice and that it rinses off his face so easily he has sensitive skin and since he got this is now shaving daily
5	i have used obagi products in the past and was very happy with them this eye cream really does help reduce fine lines around the eyes i was also surprised that it smoothed out the area below my eyes which have lost fullness as i age that area does n't appear as in now the pump provides an easy way to get out just the right amount for application i wish more products incorporated a system like this yes , these products are expensive but until recently , they could only be purchased at a doctor 's office i did have eyelid surgery twenty years ago and use a more expensive cream around my eyes to keep that area in good shape
5	very nice product but you have to go over it twice at least
5	this is the best concealer i have ever used ! i have uneven skin tones , large pores and fine lines it did an amazing job covering up and even filling pores and lines my face has never looked better
1	it was watered down ! it was a waste of my money
4	i love blinc mascara and i 've tried all the colors i have green eyes and thought this one would bring out the green it does n't it 's more like a dark gray so if you want a mascara that 's lighter than brown then green would be great i like the purple better then the green but if you do n't want to play with the different colors just stick to dark brown or black you ca n't go wrong with blinc mascara
5	i adore this color it 's a great nude color that goes with anything i wore this \( and safety pin as an accent nail \) for a wedding i was in , and it was chic and glam without being too goes with anything it 's my go to shellac nude coverage is great , and it applies smooth
5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
4	this is a bit pricey for 1 oz of moisturizer and does feel like its making the skin smoother , it is light , not oily , and felt nicely hydrating under foundation in my drying work environment it also was fine to put on my skin at night it comes out blue , which i was n't crazy about , but does n't add any visible tint to the skin it is smoothing , but you can feel it on your skin if you rub it moisturizes nicely overall
3	great color \( patina \) , very dry , not as long lasting as id hoped
2	personally , i prefer an antiperspirant in the summers here but do wear just deodorant in winter since this was vichy 24 hour deodorant i thought i 'd give it a try i love vichy products but really did not like this product at all i did not notice it said it was for light activity until after i received it i tried it on a day where all the activity i did was work on the computer , do laundry and make dinner it failed miserably within 4 hours i was starting to feel sweaty \( even though this is n't an antiperspirant and had some odor not even close to the listed on the 80 degree humid weather may have had something to do with it , but it should n't be so for me , it was totally worthless and i threw it away
4	this facial sunscreen works very well it is very lightweight and nearly fragrance free it goes on the skin smoothly and feels good the part i like the most is that it gets absorbed almost immediately and does n't make my skin oily , so it is easy to apply other skin care or makeup on top also , there is no sticky tacky feeling or residues after application neither the sunscreen provides broad spectrum spf 34 protection with a special blend of antioxidants to filter and absorb uva , uvb and infrared a rays from the sun while promoting natural repair i like that it is lightly moisturizing and helps keep the skin hydrated to me , it really feels like a sunscreen and moisturizer in one it is an effective sunscreen and a light moisturizer , albeit on the expensive side easily one of the better facial sunscreen products that i 've tried
4	smells great and works well for my all silver shoulder length hair my hair has no dye or chemicals on it so i want to keep it bright and healthy , and this helps good shampoo
3	it is fine as a powder foundation , but if you are looking for it to cover certain skin issues , it fails i am 42 years old , my skin has large pores and redness around my nose i am fair in skin tone with blue eyes i found that the makeup looked darker than my skin tone i found that the foundation did not help cover the redness and my pores and slight wrinkles were more noticeable i even combined the foundation with dermablend liquid foundation and face powder if i really caked the makeup on , my imperfections disappeared , but then my make up looked far too heavy for my personal taste the compact is nice , the small applicator is a plus the makeup is easy enough to apply and blends decently
3	this makeup definitely camouflages anything you want to cover up it 's buildable if you need more coverage it feels sticky to me but i do n't normally use any foundation if you like full coverage foundation or need to cover something up , this is for you if you do not normally wear foundation , you might not like this
5	this edp spray by the fashion house of juicy couture is extremely pretty in appearance , and it smells completely delicious ! my first impression is of melon and of honeysuckle these top notes quickly dry down into the scent of tuberose and lily , two white flowers which are often used in perfumes i barely smell the base notes of caramel and brown sugar , however the scent is very long lasting and wonderful for fruit \( the does linger \) and flower lovers i would say if you particularly love tuberose , go for this ! also if you like really stunning eau de bottles \( which i do \) , try this offering from juicy couture the bottle is very heavy , and the cut glass top is a total wow the little , attached at the bottle 's wrapped neck by a silver tone safety pin , are of an crown in faux ivory and a silvery j for juicy the label has the couture house crest in silver on the front and the box is what else \? pink ! it 's juicy couture makes a super gift for the perfume lover in your life , or for yourself i love this it really does have the juice !
5	the japonesque kumadori blending brush is a full sturdy blending brush for all your make up needs kumadori is a japanese tradition in ancient kabuki the purpose of the kumadori is to emphasize the facial expressions rather than to hide them the soft touch wide handle feels comfortable to hold while the ultra soft natural brush hairs blend pigmented powders and liquids to smooth perfection this is by far the best brush i have ever owned and i would highly recommend the line
5	i'm in love that 's all i can say i'm in love with this perfume ! i'm someone who does n't wear perfume often not because i do n't like perfume , but because it tends to be tricky for me to find a scent that i not only like but that also works well with my body chemistry when i got this perfume i put a spritz on my wrist and rubbed and a spritz that i walked through i wanted to make sure the scent was thoroughly on me to see how strong it was , if it was off putting or if it was n't too bad firstly , the scent was definitely not too strong every person that i came across i asked to smell my perfume i wanted to see what their opinion was without me telling them how expensive the perfume was every single person sniffed my wrist and their eyebrows shot up wow that smells really good ! they all said ! my husband , mr cheapskate himself , took a whiff and immediately said that he loved the smell then he started sniffing my neck to ask if i 'd put any there ! i have now learned that you should ignore the price of something and go with what works for you this perfume absolutely works beautifully for me and has enough of a scent that it smells amazing but not so much that it 's cloying i'm definitely a fan ! !
5	love opi
5	goes on smooth , is clear and has a great shine to it the picture looks deceiving b c it is a black bottle but it is a clear top coat dries relatively quickly i really like it
4	overall this is a very good concealer it does blend in slightly lighter than i expected the tan to me goes on almost like a lighter shade , say ivory it does cover decently , including dark circles under eyes , although i think if it had slightly more pigment it would work a bit better the skin tone in my family is fair so i assumed the lightest shade would be best but we will buy medium next time and see how that goes i do n't fault dermablend for that , and while not a huge fan of their products this one is good i usually find their stuff overpriced and requiring too many steps drying , setting powder etc application is simple , treat it somewhat like a lipstick and dab or stroke it gently onto your skin all in all a good concealer once you find the right shade
5	great color goes with anything red orange etc
4	i gave this to my wife to use and she likes it it is a white cream which is easy to smooth on her face she says the dark spots she is using it on seem to be getting lighter the longer she uses it it is hard to say if the effects of the lightening will be long term , so i may have to revise this review in the future the bottle may last a few months for now , this is a good product \( a bit expensive \) if you are trying to lighten some dark spots caused by sun damage or possibly aging
2	too much glitter , do n't like the way it applies or looks just not for me
5	excellent
2	tried this after becoming very disappointed with the \( art of shaving \) shaving cream line this was n't the solution ingredient list has all the right stuff , but i find the lather to be extremely weak very very small layer of protection even when i use a generous amount of cream ca n't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather , just wo n't work experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if i could find the right consistency , but could never find it i would amount this to being the shaving cream i will continue my search as this product just was n't for me the art of shaving provides a better leather , but is very drying this product makes canned gillette creams look like the cream of the crop
5	great product , keeps my hair healthy and my gray in place !
4	the l'occitane cade shaving cream does n't foam the way that the canned shaving creams do instead , you 're supposed to take a nut sized amount \( i figured double of the pea that you use for moisturizing the face \) and massage this to your face to create the lather the product spreads easily and smells fresh , green , not floral it feels luxurious , smooth , creamy and it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth my husband tried it on his face and though it took him a while to adjust to not having the lather of shaving foam , he liked the way that it felt both while he shaved and after i found it pampering when used on the legs it 's more of splurge item , but a treat to use
4	this arrived today and i could n't wait to try it out it 's a decent size bottle for the price and love that it is spray vs splash on i liked the smell well enough but ca n't say i loved it it 's stronger than my current scent my husband loved the scent , and 2 of our 3 cats wo n't stop my wrist \)
5	love it
3	meh the bottle touts this as a high shine glaze you use instead of conditioner once a week i used it yesterday and i definitely wish that i had used a conditioner instead the scent is really strong and has chemical undertones , it does fade , but i do n't care for it my hair has a bit shine in the sun , but nothing extraordinary i have thick , long hair and it feels than normal and i can tell it 's more difficult to brush unlike when i use regular conditioner it might be ok if you have shorter or layered hair at this price point , this just is n't a product that i would ever purchase
4	the foundation itself is fine it does provide good coverage and if you use a setting spray , it will last my issue with dermablend products is the colors most are darker than expected this one is darker and brighter with an off orange undertone that is not flattering i suggest you try them in person rather than it on line the product itself is nice the coverage is buildable , not loaded with fragrance and non irritating the trick is to get the right shade
4	very nice , refreshing cleansing gel the bottle makes it easy to keep handy and use often it has a very pleasant fragrance that is almost not detectable , a fresh , clean scent i like the texture of it all in all , it 's a nice cleansing gel my face feels really clean
4	i know baxter products are for men , but my wife actually ended up using this product more than i it is great for men , though , in the sense that it does not have a strong fragrance it feels nice , works well no real complaints , other than the fact that it is 24 this seems ridiculously expensive as far as i'm concerned , the cheap stuff works about as well so while i really like it , i ca n't see ever buying this full price
5	i do my own nails at home and love cnd shellac it is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days my nails always look amazing and i get a ton of compliments i also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome
5	i first came across this hairspray from my hairstylist then i found some at super cheap so i bought a can i loved the first bottle of it , so next time i was at i bought every bottle they had , lol ! but since then i do n't know if the texture of my hair has changed or what , but i do n't like it anymore it smells great but i ended up giving all of them to my mom who does still love this ! this is the only chi hairspray i 've ever tried so i ca n't really compare it to any other hairspray they offer maybe i 'll try a firmer spray next time i want to try a chi hairspray
5	i was so excited to try this product on my aging hair and on my son 's youthful cut for myself , i have short hair that is starting to thin and go grey i really loved how this clay seemed to blur my roots and gave me lots of volume on my son , we wet his hair down then slicked this over it and to the side because he has a really cute cut that you see on in for example it worked really well on him too it kept his look all day at school \( and through gym \) i highly recommend this product
5	i 've used a variety of different beard oils , from small , locally produced ones , to national brand ones most of them all work the same , and they all generally smell the same not so with the beard oil ! first of all , the packaging is outstanding , and really looks like you are getting a high end product \( pics attached \) the major is the smell , however it smells absolutely amazing and unique ! ever since i used it and kissed my wife , she ca n't stop commenting on how great it smells ! now that 's all the endorsement i need !
1	i tried to use crepe erase and found it so heavily perfumed , it was i used it on my hands and did n't notice much to write about certainly not any better than a store brand olay some may have great results but if you have any perfume sensitivities , stay clear the strong , alcohol perfume lingered and every time i put my hand near my lips , they actually stung i could never use this product on my face you do get a nice big tube , so there 's that this product is not for me
4	i tend to like perfume that is n't so bold as to overpower here we have an attractively designed contemporary bottle , well manufactured for this price range , and a perfume that has a pleasant jasmine and musk scent which , lightly applied , does indeed smell like laundry that i 've washed in over the course of the day , the scent smoothly leaving the freshness intact very nice
2	makes the spot you are covering look dry and dull not a natural look i will not buy this again
5	you can not go wrong with jack black !
5	get this for the man in your life they will really love you for it and you will love the way they smell \) it does have a faintly oriental odor that is not overpowering or feminine i am tempted to wear it on me ! the bottle is a nice masculine looking design that your man will not be afraid of using will definitely buy more as he is using it all the time
4	yes , this sunscreen is expensive but , for a high quality product that actually does what i need it to it is amazing ! the sunscreen kept me protected and my face did not look greasy after applying
4	did not receive instruction booklet
3	well it goes like this if you really , really want to smell like after the shower , try the man made wash because will seriously i suppose it 's supposed to be a but i tend to be allergic to fragrances and this is one body wash my body or skin is not super enthusiastic about my standard for a body wash is one that does not smell at all and does not the skin 's natural and healthy odor but the man made seems to aggressively attempt to replace that with some combination of stale tobacco , old leather and sweat which maybe make some feel good or more manly but it makes me want to go back to the shower and wash again with something else to get this odor off my three star rating stand for if it 's not good for me , it does n't mean that everyone should avoid it because it does the wash part it 's only the smell that makes me disagree
4	first let 's look at the trinity device itself and then we 'll get into the eye and lip enhancer attachment the nuface trinity makes a big promise use and you will see your skin plump and firm to reduce the signs of aging does it work \? yes is it the easiest or most convenient product ever invented \? no read on process after washing your face , you will apply the gel primer to the areas you want to target because the gel dries very fast i break up my face into three treatment areas forehead brows , left side of face , right side of face following the of the device , you glide the nuface over the area three times there are many techniques you can use to do this for example , your cheek side of face is divided into three sections along the jaw , in the hollows of your cheeks , and on your cheek bone you glide over each area three times , slowly , in to the beep of the device you can also use a hold technique where you leave the device in one place for the beep cycle this is particularly effective on your nasolabial folds and for picking up your eyebrows when you are finished you will wash the gel primer off with a warm wash cloth you can then apply moisturizer and either makeup \( if using in am \) or night creams \( if using in pm \) results you will see results instantly i notice them most in my smile lines and in my brows the 'elevens' between my eyes let me explain the effect is two fold the lines are plumped so you no longer see the smile lines or the 'elevens' there is also a slight effect in that you can smile and the lines do n't come back very neat i hate my down turned brows i have taught myself to constantly hold them up using my forehead muscles the nuface creates the same result i get when holding my brows up my brows easily stay up about a centimeter from where they would be in resting position this makes me look more awake and less grumpy definitely a plus ! drawbacks the biggest drawback is that the results are temporary after about 6 hours your face is back to normal therefore if you want the results , you 'll need to use everyday day and night which brings me to the second drawback time is a big issue for a full treatment with optimal results , you need about 20 30 minutes i find if i do a the results are n't near as noticeable and fade quickly if you have the time to spend an hour a day on your face , you 'll have no issues for those of us who need every minute of every day for work life it gets old even though the results are great it 's still a great investment for those nights out when you want to look fabulous i actually first heard about the product in an elle magazine article about stylists and makeup artists who used it to prep celebrities before an award show so they would look younger and refreshed i hate how the gel primer feels it 's similar to smearing your face with syrup or jelly i just do not like the sensation then it is thick so you have to work it off with the washcloth ele \( eye and lip enhancer \) attachment i should state that i do not have smoker 's lines on my lips and i do not yet have crow 's feet perhaps if i had these types of lines i would have gotten more out of the ele that said , i do have awful tear trough lines and smile lines i honestly did not notice a big difference when using the ele attachment to target these areas and using the regular nuface i experienced the same amount of lift and plump without having to switch out the device heads some of the youtube tutorials i watched recommended using the ele to really target your brows and i have to say i get much better lift using the original device on my brows than the ele ! based on my experience , you really do n't need the ele unless perhaps you have smoker 's lines or crow 's feet
4	other than being quite pricey this is a really nice product it 's designed as a cleanser , which i take to mean a shampoo conditioner type of product \( but not really your basic all in one \) this does a really good job of cleaning your hair while also still leaving it nice and conditioned the smell is also really nice \( oribe also has a couple of fragrances \)
3	la roche posay is noted for their quality products this eyeliner pencil is no exception it glides on easily and i did not find it to be irritating it has a decent amount of pigment so you do n't have to go over and over the areas you want it on the color brown is a neutral medium tone shade that will suit many that said i did not find it to be that much superior to other less expensive products and the shade is a common one i did find the packaging to be annoying it is overly wrapped and a pain to open the size is good and it should last a long time you will need a sharpener for this one
5	beautiful color
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i used to wear burberry tender touch \( the one in the pink bottle \) but they stopped making it years ago recently i tried burberry body and i love it but feel like it 's really a summer only fragrance my other favorite is black for women burberry london for women is that perfect perfume , i can wear it every day it 's not chemical smelling , it 's not overpowering , i never feel like i need to wear a certain outfit to pull it off i love it so much i 've moved the bottle from my bathroom to my nightstand so that when i put it on in the morning the scent hangs around in my bedroom all day buy it for yourself or for a gift without worrying about the season or your age , it 's just wonderful for everybody !
4	so far i am liking this product i put it on at night after my shower and let it soak into my feet all night while i sleep i noticed a difference just after a couple of nights my feet feel softer and smoother i would n't want to put this on during the day and walk around all day with it on my feet , but it is a great night treatment
4	love the color
5	thank you so much
5	it was a gift to my girlfriend and she loves it she wears it all the time she loves the color and it stays on for a while
5	this is a deep reddish purple color , really lovely , and unusual not sure what else to say , but need these extra words to post \)
5	no complaints at all i have a couple of patches of vitiligo and this does an excellent job of covering them up i have n't tried the setting powder yet but it seems to have plenty of staying power on its own
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great product delivered on time
4	there are some things about this highlighter that are good the brush to apply and a nice looking compact container the colour nor is lighter than it looks on the site , so if you need a darker highlighter , this might not be for you you push down on the button on one end , which is difficult to do while holding it up to your face it takes one or two pumps to have the liquid come out on the brush however sometime two pumps and definitely 3 and it drips off you also have to brush very thoroughly in order to have it look natural the price seems high for what you do get , especially compared to other brands and methods of applying highlighters
5	gentle yet very effective removed all makeup including mascara with only two pumps on a cotton pad , however i always choose to double cleanse no matter how good the product did not sting my eyes which is a big plus !
4	i got this in hopes of helping my babies face her little cheeks get so red and look cracked although this is thick and smells weird , it did help over all there was not a huge difference but enough that i 've kept using it
1	was n't as sticky as the other brands but it felt funny after it evaporated not what 's i would say is comfortable i usually use put distilled water into a spray bottle but thought i would try the entire line did not like the brand any longer but i have used it in the past it 's not consistent , possible change in formulation
5	if you are looking for a great comb to carry with you and you are a guy , this is n't it obviously , it is n't going to fit well in your pocket if you are a woman and have a purse , it 's a different story what i do is keep the comb at home for grooming after a shower the comb is very well constructed as you might expect from its price the use for which this comb excels is as an out of the shower and styling comb it is perfect for working rapidly and effectively with thick , wet hair it is also great for working with hair that was sprayed with hairspray and styled right out of the shower and is now dry the comb works easily through hair that might stop a flimsy comb
5	this is the perfect pink and i really love it order and i do n't think you will be disappointed at all
5	vichy 's aqualia is basically water on steroids it is light , hydrating , and a pleasure to use i tend to be about skin care routines and rarely bother with makeup , but i am using aqualia regularly because i absolutely adore the light , mildly floral fragrance this product not only smells wonderful , it does n't set off any sinus in my chemically sensitive nose that 's a very good thing my oily youth has paid off my very mature skin is n't terribly dry , so this product is perfect for me i use it morning and night after washing my face \( and sometimes in the afternoon because it 's so refreshing \) i just put a little on a cotton pad and rub it in it seems to clean my skin a little more after the soap , which is pretty impressive and it feels sooo good aqualia absolutely keeps my face more hydrated than it normally would be that 's obvious on drier days on very dry days , i put a little moisturizing cream on top of it , especially if i'm going out i 've been testing this product in winter and i love how refreshing it is in summer , it 's going to be over the moon pleasurable to use ! i will be purchasing more before this bottle runs out while not inexpensive , if you do n't soak your cotton pad too heavily , this will last quite a while \( i do n't recommend using cotton balls because they will make it go too fast \) if your skin is anything but very dry , i 'd recommend giving thermal facial essence water a try if you wear makeup , this is a great light moisturizer
1	the first coat was too thin and watery !
4	my experience with jack black products over the years has been quite favorable , and that holds true for this shampoo , which i 've used before the shampoo itself is , for the most part , colorless and its scent both interesting and muted made with basil white lupine \( white \? \) , the smell is unique and not objectionable , though i much prefer a shampoo that smells like coconut or mint the label claims that expansion technology helps to make your hair thicker and fuller , but no one 's commented on my hair looking thicker and fuller and i have n't noticed much of a difference however , that being said , my scalp remains healthy and free
5	always happy with this brand i 've used this foundation for years
1	when i tried to find out about the ingredients of eltamd uv sport broad spectrum spf 50 , i noticed the following claim on their website active ingredients 9 0 zinc oxide , 7 50 octinoxate , 5 0 octisalate ingredient tocopheryl acetate \( vitamin e \) antioxidant that reduces free radicals to help diminish the visible signs of aging zinc oxide natural mineral compound that works as a sunscreen agent by reflecting and uva and uvb rays octinoxate organic compound that helps increase uv protection inactive ingredients bees wax , butylene glycol , cetyl dimethicone , cetyl peg ppg 10 1 dimethicone , disodium edta , hexyl laurate , hydrogenated castor oil , iodopropynyl butylcarbamate , isopropyl palmitate , octyldodecyl neopentanoate , polyglyceryl 4 isostearate , purified water , sodium chloride , tocopheryl acetate , both active and inactive ingredients are full of chemicals but why would eltamd would try to promote a hazardous material like octinoxate as an organic compound worth placing it on human 's biggest organ which gets absorbed and processed by the liver is an indication of eltamd values
4	love the color quality good as all opi products
5	i love the way this absorbs so thoroughly yet protects so superbly
3	this toothpaste flavor is not that unique i was hoping it had more of the ginger flavor than the mint , but it 's mainly mint and there 's very little trace of ginger i simply hate the taste of toothpaste , all of it every single brand stings my mouth and makes me gag , the more minty the flavor the worse it is this one makes me gag too , unfortunately however , i'm going to order the jasmine flavor and hope for the best yes , it 's expensive and probably not worth the extra money but if i can find a flavor that does n't make me gag and does n't sting my tongue , i'm willing to pay more i 'll make my hubby use this ginger mint flavor up he can use anything hopefully the jasmine will be more sweet than minty i'm going to pay 10 for the of testing it out otherwise , i do n't know what other brand makes something that is n't overly minty tom 's used to make an orange flavor but it 's been discontinued apparently my sensitivity to mint is unique , it must be because it seems that everybody else loves it otherwise there would be a market for toothpaste without it if the jasmine marvis does n't work out , i guess i 'll just have to gag as usual
3	i have tried a few foam free shaving creams or shaving butters that cost more than off the shelf traditional foams or gels like the others , this cream provides a smooth , comfortable shave however , the benefits of it over a 3 shaving gel are not apparent enough for me to continue with it or the others i have tried the cream is on my face so briefly that i cannot imagine the natural ingredients contributing to the health of my skin the quality of the shave really seems no better than with the gillette gel i was using the is that this is a good shaving cream with natural , dead sea ingredients that sound healthy and feel for me , the benefit does not justify the cost difference between it and other cheap gels
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	thanks \)
5	if you are someone who loves a truly feminine fragrance this is it ! i specially selected this perfume , and i will be wearing happily on my wedding day in 2 weeks ! i want to have the perfect scent that will always remind me of the day i get married ! i was reading tuberose and vanilla aromas have very relaxing and calming properties which will be perfect for me as a nervous bride this perfume also carries notes of creme brulee which happens to be my fiance 's favorite dessert ! i was wearing a little bit of the fragrance yesterday and he could n't stop clinging to me he just loves it ! when i this perfume 's sweet , creamy , soft scent it was true love at first sniff ! there is something exotic and just so pretty about it it is definitely a perfect scent for all seasons my husband to be also loves juicy cologne and wears dirty english by juicy for men i love the way my juicy couture and his dirty english cologne smell together i think those 2 juicy fragrances were created to compliment one another i think any woman could appreciate this perfume it is just so universally pleasing to everyone and fit for all ages
3	so both my daughter and i used this product i tend to get hormonal outbreaks and she is a teenager and has more of a tendency to get outbreaks for me , it did n't work in all fairness , my skin is pretty sensitive to many products this definitely caused a reaction my skin was puffy and red and hot on the flip side , it worked quite well for my daughter she had no reaction to it and felt like it helped control the oil she gets in her t zone for that reason i'm giving it a 3 star rating right in the middle if you have sensitive skin , you might want to avoid it , but if not , it might be worth a try for you
3	pretty color but it is really silver not gray , lighter than appears in the picture , its okay but i really needed wanted a color that was gray and a little darker
2	this product appears to be targeted for those who apply a lot of different make up products to get that perfect look i'm a great deal more when it comes to applying make up and i honestly am not seeing a difference when using this
4	color and stays longer
1	baffled by the positive reviews for this face wash i guess this could work for minor acne but it did n't make a dent in mine i 've since learned much more about the dangers of using , and have switched to much more gentle skin care that does n't cause as much inflammation \( raw honey , oils , etc \)
5	i like to keep my routine simple just because i do n't stick with complicated i was concerned that this product would dry out my skin but it is refreshing and feels great i used this line of products before the toner and i can say that it does make a difference i even like it in the cold midwest winters
3	i have very sensitive skin and this serum was very difficult on my skin it gave me some peeling and irritation the scent is nice and a little bit goes a long way it rubs in smoothly and absorbs into the skin easily it did lighten some of my darker spots , but overall , the redness it caused on my sensitive skin was n't really worth the improvement on the darker spots
5	just started to use over the acetone what a good purchase again
5	this is most definitely the most effective skin serum i have used on my sensitive and aging skin ! it has been extremely effective in reducing fine lines and smoothing out my skin , especially prior to applying makeup i also apply at bedtime and my skin still feels smooth and silky in the morning when i rinse the sleep from my face and eyes i also use it on my entire jawline and neck as i am a convinced our necks show our age more than our faces will i'm not sure i will ever want to be without this juice beauty repair booster serum or the other products i am using this fall and winter outstanding , love the fragrance , effectiveness and quality of this serum along with the j b stem cellular eye lift treatment fantastic , moderately priced product for healing and slowing my sensitive aging process love it ! \( reviewed by my wife \)
4	love this stuff ! ! wish i would have found this year 's ago it would have saved me tons of money ! ! !
5	love their colors !
5	i have very dry skin and this product is awesome just enough moisture does n't make face oily like some products do i had used the absolute moisturizer found it was just not enough moisture for my skin this one is perfect
5	just received this beauty box and it is amazing ! ! ! i absolutely love the ahava hand cream that i 've tried so far \) it has a super soft scent and feels luxurious the actual box holding all the luxury items is very pretty and reusable ca n't wait to try everything ! ! i received exactly what was pictured i love love love skin bath products , , so this is great for me ! ! if you like birchbox , you 'll like this \) \) so happy i purchased not only do i get an intro to some new products and brands , but a 20 credit for what i love ! ! nice amazon ! nice ! !
5	great stuff , leaves hair nice and thick
5	this is the first time i have used this polish and really like it would buy again stays on long
5	this product did an excellent job covering up a scar from a curling iron mishap ! when i wear short sleeves , it really does bother me , and this concentrated stick applicator really gave a nice layer of natural color to make it disappear
5	wonderful product that really helped improve my acne prone skin i am acne free and glowing !
5	i 've used mario badescu skincare for about 10 years now love it and will never switch to anything else the product i 'd most brag about the vitamin c serum it keeps me looking much younger than i am and is the most effective product i 've ever tried for keeping my melasma at bay when i ran out of the last bottle the spots came back slowly but surely and much darker a true test of its efficiency i highly recommend all mb products they give you excellent results for a great price
3	works well lasts a long time make sure you purchase a good moisturizer to use with this product as it really dries out your skin
4	love the color ! does n't wear as well as some other brands
5	beautiful color , speedy delivery , and the merchant was very helpful and responsive i originally received this item defective , it was very tacky and thick , hard to put on i emailed him , and he sent a replacement immediately , which i also received quickly will definitely do business again ! ty ! !
4	i own 2 clarisonic cleansers and cannot say enough positive things about them i currently use the soft brush heads i like this brush head because it cleanses thoroughly without being too rough on my skin this review has little to do with this brush head , but really has everything to do with the cleanser which is a great way to good facial hygiene
5	i'm seriously getting sold on demablend ! i 've been using four products the last month and have been really happy with them this is no different i 've used green cover up makeup before for a few imperfections i have found that sometimes they are too chalky and do not blend well , and the other one disappeared once my liquid makeup was applied it did n't happen with this ! i applied both with fingertips and with a sponge , both worked great ! i followed up with dermablend liquid makeup and loved it the green covers pimples , red splotches , and red discoloration this makeup is not thick , and applies easily the tube is small , but you only need a small amount i did not experience any rash or irritation it takes a few applications to get used to applying green makeup before your regular makeup but it works wonders !
3	this skin treatment has little fragrance so it does not interfere with my perfume , and it does not bother me when i do n't feel like adding yet another scent to my skin treatment routine the creamy lotion is non greasy and quickly absorbs my skin can get pretty dry , and this cream was n't able to fully fight the dryness i really did n't see any improvement with crepe skin issues either i'm not sure it 's worth the money for my skin so i doubt i would purchase this in the future
5	i have medium yellowish olive skin tone which has been difficult to find a neutral this shade tea and crumpets is beautiful ! i was looking for a color that would match as closely as possible to my natural nail bed color , and i was not having any luck ! finally i went less pink , more neutral tan , and this is so flattering ! contrary to what i thought , it 's lighter than my skin tone , and it actually brightens my fingers i mistakenly thought lighter colors would darken my skin , but this is a splendid exception \( nice word splendid \) it 's definitely a frost , and i find it streaks a little , but i'm not a professional , so that 's fine for me i'm just thrilled to death i finally found a color that is n't goth or weird or screaming for attention i like subtle and refined , and this is it ! it 's so pretty !
5	though the image looks pink purple , this color would be appropriately labeled as a nude nail polish i love this color and it looks fantastic either shiny or matte i bought this bottle to replace one that i used up because it is such a pretty nude color
5	my wife loves this i have had the opportunity to try many salon hair oils for shine and damage , and this one is the best im currently dealing with massive breakage due to over drying my hair and overuse of a flat iron this oil in conjunction with the lanza healing oil shampoo and conditioner is bringing hope back to my life the combination of these three products has made my hair feel like it has n't felt in years i forgot hair could feel this healthy i do n't care if its expensive this stuff is worth every penny for those who are concerned that its a fake product , i can tell you that mine ive taken a picture of the bottle i purchased about three months ago at a reputable beauty supply store and the product i received from amazon yesterday they are exactly the same the text on the bottle , the aroma , the feel of the product the exact same when i use this product , i usually dry my hair slightly , let it air dry a few minutes , put about a quarter size in my palm and pull it through my hair if you put the oil in while your hair is damp , speed up the dry time , and then if you want to add a little more at the end for shine , you can do that i use it pretty liberally , and its taken me three months to get through half of a bottle the only caveat i would have is that i do n't love the aroma its hard to describe perhaps a little powdery , a little old lady perfume y that being said , the product is so good , im willing to overlook that give your hair a treat !
3	this is an overpriced skin cream which is highly fragranced my jar arrived without any other packaging and there were no ingredients listed so i referenced the company 's website for the data to figure out what this product is this is a typical non natural skin cream product this is scented with a lab made fragrance , to me it smells like a crisp orange with a twist of something woody it is labeled as cedarwood but i work often with cedarwood essential oil and have cedar wood objects in my home and to me this is nothing like cedar , but i like the fragrance this is highly scented which i like but it 's like a cloud of fragrance if you apply it to your body \( versus just your hands \) this is a water based skin cream which does not have extra ingredients that would cross this over to a medical spa type healing product this is a basic skin creme so this is overpriced for what it is , it is ml which is 7 ish ounces , do the math for the price so how did it perform \? on my hands it absorbed 100 and immediately which acted more like a lotion than a skin creme , but my bare hands are used for things like cooking , dishwashing , cleaning , doing , making art , so they need more moisture than this can provide on the hands this left no barrier afterwards , it was all absorbed instantly , i need something more and a creme provides that that is why i say this acts more like a lotion on my body it sunk it but left some on the surface as a barrier because this is more like a lotion and due to the size to price ratio i did n't feel this was worth the cost , especially since it 's a regular creme not a medical spa grade treatment product , rating 3 stars it 's okay also it is so strong i worried it would bother other people in public , in the interview i attended and in my college class and i did n't want to be that intrusive with my body fragrance
5	so cute
5	i have fair skin with freckles this product is perfect for me the light beige color goes with fair skin the powder goes on easily with a nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href brush dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 brush a nbsp and smooths out my skin tone and covers my freckles i do n't have serious skin flaws that require masking , just little flaws with room for improvement so i just use a thin layer of powder that 's all i need a little bit makes a big improvement in the appearance of my skin i do n't really need to build it up , but if you have problem areas you can build it up where you need to skin powder light so your face is not so shiny i do n't care about shiny skin except when it comes to photos and , and then powder makes a big difference in how the picture comes out without powder , my face looks weird in pictures if you are going somewhere and you think someone is going to take your picture , be sure to put on some powder i used to use foundation with translucent powder , but i like this solution better , especially in the summer the powder camo works all by itself , and it is light and quick to put on very nice stuff
5	i 've seen noticeable improvement in my skin texture , and color after 8 days of use i applied a liberal amount each night before bed , after washing with a natural fruit enzyme facial cleaner there was no greasiness to the cream , so it was a little difficult to determine how much to apply nevertheless , i put enough on to and let it go to work the smell is almost none so it could be used by a man as well as a women based on the rate at which i'm using this , i imagine that 1 bottle would last 30 days of liberal use or could be stretched to a few months is used sparingly or only on troublesome areas
5	very moisturizing , just takes a little bit
5	i was excited to try this because i have long been familiar with the bliss brand , but had n't tried any of their makeup products yet their makeup line interested me because they described it as and who does n't want makeup that also has complexion boosting benefits i was supposed to receive their darker bronzer , but actually received me caramel ' looking at the color in the pan it struck me as being pretty accurately named it 's a warm toned , caramel colored bronzer with a ever so subtle shimmer i used it to contour my face along with shimmer from the smashbox on blush palette for my highlight i gently swept it just under my cheek bones , along the underside of my jawline , along my hairline , and the of my nose when used with the shimmer it makes for a contouring look that 's perfect for a day look and adds more definition for my look for a night look i use it after the cover fx contour kit in n medium for my neutral toned light medium skin i think this shade is perfect however , i do have friends whose skin trends more cool and who struggle to find a bronzer that works for their skintone and for them , i'm not sure this would work i also liked the longevity it stayed all day and i only needed to touch up after work for the night out as for the promised skin benefits , i'm not sure i 've seen them which honestly is n't surprising since i use bronzer more for contouring and am only applying a small amount to small sections of my face that aside i'm still very happy with this bronzer i think it 's a great choice for contouring for someone who many not want to invest in a whole kit , especially if you already have a highlighter that you like
5	just beautiful !
5	wonderful very light , almost undetectable fragrance using this in the shower , after washing , really skin feeling soft and smooth no longer is my skin dry later in the day , the moisturizing effect lasts all day great idea wash , rinse , use bioderma , rinse and pat skin dry this will be a permanent fixture in the shower from now n
5	but im on 2nd to see results , it gives teeth that no grit feel like after a cleaning i , and does so each use the whitening takes 6 using both and i 've now seen a visible difference even w out a tan
5	i loved this chemical free vegan polish it came in a very pretty bottle design and the color \( \) was a pretty greyish purple i like that it was fast drying as well nothing worse then trying to wait to let your nails dry i did not use a top or base coat but used 3 coats of polish and it looked great and stayed looking good for over a week i do n't mind that there is smaller amount then other brands , i would rather use it up then have it sit around and get old and toss it out over all this is a great product
3	i was concerned when i ordered this that the light beige color in the la roche posay toleriane teint hydrating foundation might be a bit too dark for my fair skin but i was pleasantly surprised it was a good match if your having trouble deciding what color to chose i suggest going a bit darker as i feel the light beige is lighter than most other name brands i have tried this foundation has a light feel , goes on smooth and covers adequately it is marketed towards normal to dry skin and claims to even out and illuminate but for me it made my dry skin appear dull the foundation is very matte it seemed to stick to the dry areas and draw attention to them i might try this product again in the summertime when my skin is less dry but as of now it just seems to accentuate the dryness on a good note this did not irritate my sensitive skin or cause any breakouts i also like that it is fragrance free i feel that it might be better suited to someone whose skin is not as dry as mine
3	i do n't use a lot of make up but my aging skin might benefit from some moisturizing and certainly spf 15 can be a benefit unfortunately , the yellowish cast to this product did not flatter me , and the moisturizing effect was minimal here are the ingredients as listed on the jouer cosmetics website titanium dioxide 4 5 , zinc oxide 3 inactive ingredients water , cyclopentasiloxane , octyldodecyl neopentanoate , butylene glycol , polyglyceryl 4 isostearate , dimethicone crosspolymer , peg ppg 18 18 dimethicone , silica , dimethicone , cetyl peg ppg 10 1 dimethicone , stearic acid , aluminum hydroxide , sodium , , hexyl laurate , , nylon 12 , sodium chloride , retinyl palmitate , tocopherol , tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate , , crosspolymer , magnesium chloride , potassium chloride , zinc chloride , lysine , sodium hyaluronate , phenoxyethanol , methylparaben , propylparaben , ethylparaben , butylparaben , , potassium sorbate may contain \( \) mica , titanium dioxide , iron oxides some of these ingredients are listed in the skin deep database as being in the red zone of high concern they are propylparaben , retinyl palmitate , and butylparaben i suggest researching these and at least avoiding them during pregnancy since all three have toxicity listed as possible effects in fairness , most cosmetics contain something that 's suspected of being bad for you , but that would not be the case in an ideal world
3	i wish it had made a difference , and perhaps it just needs more time , but i applied it to my right eye only for the last 4 days , and as you can see by the picture , there is not really a noticeable difference note that my right eye is on the left side of the photo , for when you are comparing , so if it had worked , the left side of the image would look better \( photo has no makeup or of any kind which is pretty evident , but i'm stating it here for the record \) the metal tip applicator is very clever , and yes , it is quite cold against the skin i am assuming there is something with anti inflammatory qualities in the ingredients , but that is on my part , as i did not see a difference i guess i should try sleeping more if only that were as easy as applying cream to my face
5	hot tools is my go to brand for curling irons i have 5 in different sizes i use this size iron \( 3 4 \) for my vintage inspired hair styles if set properly , it really the look of a on my hair really wish these bad boys had an automatic shutoff after a certain amount of time , but it is still my favorite regardless they last for years , and i 've never had one malfunction on me \( unlike other brands \) a very happy addition to my hair styling arsenal
4	love it , pretty color
5	along with the perfect shade of dermablend cover creme \( warm beige \) , this quick fix concealer stick is probably my favorite new makeup product by dermablend that i 've tried so far and i 've tried several items over the past few weeks first , the lipstick style tube makes it extremely easy to apply the concealer but do n't press too hard or you may get more than you for that said , even this light shade covers well , but perhaps too well my spouse said it looked like i had a black eye on the other hand , i received a compliment at work , and i thought i looked good , so maybe it just needed to sink in i used it specifically to hide my purple tone under my eyes and my reddish nose , but if i find myself with any acne in the future this will be the first item i grab this turned out great for me and it 's easily recommended
5	beautiful color ! ! !
3	this medicated acne mask is better as a spot treatment for me that applying to the full face it has a whole list of ingredients and many of them seem to be plant based but it 's still fairly and harsh on my skin and made it red and itchy in parts that are not oily the menthol like ingredient in it almost burned off my skin as it seemed too harsh my eyes always get red and itchy with shampoos that have tea tree oil or peppermint for cooling the scalp , so i washed it off as soon as i realized it had some menthol type ingredient in it however , it did help with an acne spot when i applied to the oily part near my nose that had a zit i cannot use this product as i am allergic to something in it , but i am giving it 3 stars as it seems to have a lot of natural ingredients and might work well for acne for some people i did not like the nature of this product , it seemed more like a scrub than a mask , but that 's probably because my skin is more sensitive to scrubs
5	love this product i use it over my eyeshadow for a great sparkle without it looking like sparkles also if you put in the corner or your eye \( nose side \) it really opens up your eyes and makes them appear bigger
3	just another curling iron at the right price works
5	love the color and the quality of essie dark blue navy is pretty in as a color this year so i plan on wearing this polish a lot
2	i really do n't like this cleanser it 's hard to squeeze out a really small dab , and anything marble sized or bigger ends up being way too much product it neither lathers well nor is a creamy cleanser , plus it 's kind of slimy , so it 's kind of the worst of all worlds it does leave my face clean , i will give it that , and my skin has n't been irritated i need a separate product for eye makeup i have no idea why it 's called rejuvenation because my face does not look younger upon use , but if anything feels dry and tight , and really crying out for moisturizer so it 's not a fantastic product for me
5	this product works very well to thicken my fine hair applying it while towel damp after a fresh washing , i 've found it 's best to use a minimum amount of the product too much makes my hair sticky difficult to comb through it did take a few times of application to find the right amount
4	i got this for a friend of mine who was interested in trying it \( it is not the right color for myself or my wife \) she was impressed with the make up and coverage , but the color just was n't as perfect a match this is a great idea for a product , but i think you have to be very careful about matching the color it either works for you or it is going to look a little funny
5	love this color
4	i have liked most of the vichy products i have tried i like that this one is refreshing and feels good on my face while offering it moisture after cleaning i do n't like the way many cleansers dry out my skin i just ca n't afford the dryness it kind of felt funny on my skin though this product has a very faint scent it is hard to figure out it is like fresh lake water or baby powder kind of both i do n't generally like scents but this one was faint enough not to bother me
5	this is a lovely sheer foundation with a luminous glow i am very fair \( \) and the opal shade was just right for me this works like a lightweight bb cream on a good skin day i could wear this alone with concealer , but that is for very light coverage most days i would wear this under foundation on my dry cheeks and undereyes i need moisturizer underneath this , so i would n't buy this thinking that it is a substitute for a tinted moisturizer but the good news is that it wo n't make your skin look shiney or greasy i thought at first that i should not use it in my t zone , but it is absolutely fine used all over the face it is a lovely addition to my makeup because it creates a sheer glow
4	age defying \? i do n't know about that is nice moisturizer i normally do not like the real thick and sticky feeling creams , however this feels thick and sticky until you apply it and give it a few minutes , then it absorbs into the skin and leaves your face feeling hydrated , and soft it smells really good too !
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	my hair is extremely long , very fine , and \( sadly \) starting to thin its been hard to deal with for as long as i can remember , and even though ive been living with it my entire life , i never quite became good with hair , the way some people do on its own its neither perfectly straight nor wavy it tends to frizz and it attracts static like business for the longest time , i wore my hair in the same layered style , turning the ends under and trying to feather the front or trying to wear a side part that did n't end up looking greasy by the end of the day forget they make my hair look limp and in need of a good wash and in spite of practicing at it every day for a solid year , watching every tutorial out there , and getting an in person demo from my stylist , i never learned to make spiral curls with one the of the curling wand was a game changer for me i do n't have to worry about my wrist not wanting to move a certain way , and i did n't have to learn any special techniques its just wrap , count , and release i can vary the waves by changing the size of the section of hair , and i can loosen them just a touch with a slight tug while they 're still warm the versatility of these appliances is amazing i love that they come in so many sizes and shapes a allow for so many looks the sultra bombshell is my fourth curling wand the 1 inch straight barrel allows me to do a big , subtle wave thats smooth and sleek i love the look i can create with this the waves are so loose , my hair looks like it just has an easy , natural wave my hair is extremely long , so a barrel this size works fairly well im not sure how it would do on shorter hair the wand only has one heat setting , but it heats quickly i have another high end wand that gets much , much hotter \( which is kind of scary actually \) so if you have very thick or very coarse hair , you might want to experiment a bit to get your section size and time right i would definitely recommend this wand for anyone who has really long , fine hair like mine at the amazon price of 130 00 , its actually more expensive than the wand i have , but if it lasts as long as that one has \( ive had it four years \) it would be worth it i do have to note that i do n't use the heat gloves i discovered very early on that they get in my way and cause my very fine hair to frizz i am extremely careful when these hot wands however , and i do n't recommend that anyone go without the glove who has n't before , unless you are using a wand that has a cool tip \( most higher end wands do not have one , but both of my remington wands have this feature \) it takes a lot of practice to handle these things safely so its better to practice with a glove or a cool tip beforehand
5	this stuff works great !
5	i confess that my blush usually comes from the grocery store as i get older which means both that i have to work a little harder to like how i look when i go out the door and that i have more financial i have been trying higher end makeup products and discovering that there are actually reasons to prefer some of them this one is a keeper it seems to work with my skin better than grocery store blush it 's more on my skin and wants to stay there instead of the other that is happy to fly away \( and i have an oily complexion , \) i am extremely happy with the way this goes on , the way it stays on , and the way it looks \( and feels ! \) i think that part of the think is that it 's sort of lighter weight than the blush i'm used to , so there 's better color for less product on my skin also , as mentioned in the product info , this means that you can build up the color more effectively than the relatively clumsy products i'm used to this ends up feeling more like naked skin to me when i wear it , because it is so lightweight i do n't think budget me in my 20 's and 30 's made the wrong choice , but i'm really happy to discover this blush and will be buying it again
4	when this arrived , the dryer smelled pretty bad i had n't even turned it on yet but i kept picking up an electrical burning scent it filled my bathroom when i put it in there , so i was skeptical to turn it on and use it the first few times i used the dryer , it smelled , but gradually my thought was maybe it just needed to be broken in although it was n't a good impression \( having read previous reviews w electrical problems \) , i am loving it now it 's very soft to the touch , easy to use and dries my hair pretty quickly i was using an old conair dryer that finally died , so i was happy to upgrade there are 3 temperature settings which i like , and i do n't think the hot gets so hot that it burns your head , hair and leaves you seeing smoke it is a little heavy as previous reviews have mentioned , but i do n't find that it is difficult to hold for the couple minutes i am using it i never had a problem w frizz , so i ca n't speak to that i do n't notice any additional damage to my hair , and that 's all that matters to me i am just enjoying the couple minutes my long hair takes to dry using this , versus several minutes with other dryers it 's also quieter than my last dryer as well overall , i am liking this dryer a lot and would purchase again
5	butter london has once again met and exceeded all my expectations this polish color is just as vibrant as it appears butter london 's colors are always rich and beautiful in person all what i really love about their nail polish is the fact that is does n't have any of the horrible smells that many of the other brands have because they cut out those chemicals the polish does n't destroy the nail like many other products and is always easy to remove and applies smoothly and thickly two coats is perfect if you have n't tried their polish before i highly recommend it !
5	this is nonirritating to my skin , which so you know is very rare my skin is easily irritated and can turn red from products it works best used day and night if you want to keep your pores cleaner and less chance of blackheads and breakouts works great with concentrate , lotion and moisturizer
5	i have n't been pleased with self tanners in the past and almost did n't order this , but i am glad i did the mousse goes on creamy \( once you let the application mitt dry \) but is almost instantly absorbed best yet i did n't get a streaky line from applying it down the back of my legs and the color was a very natural warm tan no obnoxious smells i do n't like to wear so this extends the season for me it took about an hour to show , so do n't get anxious and reapply i'm pretty light so the first week i applied a second coat after 3 days , but i only needed to do that one time the color lasts a week i have tried several products and this is by far the best !
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	daily use of a blow dryer and hot iron can leave my color treated hair feeling dry , so i use a conditioner every time i shampoo although i have a lot of hair , the individual texture is fine and this oribe intense conditioner provides moisture without weighing my hair down my hair is shoulder length and about is all i need to use i apply the conditioner from the mid shaft down and leave it on for 3 5 minutes before rinsing this product has a clean , fresh fragrance and leaves my hair soft and tangle free , with plenty of volume im used to paying salon prices for a quality conditioner , but i have to admit that the price on this product \( currently 49 for 6 8 oz \) gave me sticker shock this conditioner works well for my hair type but id find the price prohibitive
5	i like this one ! it 's really thick for a glitter and i just wore it alone great with 4 coats
3	this color \( tickle my france y \) was definitely not what i expected i do n't know if it is an old batch or what but it 's not my favorite much more of a purple mauve than any of the photos here appear i would not call this a neutral , really it 's very purple to me it looks all right on my fair skin but i would not purchase this shade again in the future unless it was in person and the color appeared more neutral and muted
4	this is different from anything else i have ever tried expected it to be a gloss but it is more opaque and matte than a gloss the color is more intense and has much higher coverage than a gloss it is moist but not greasy or sticky the color stays on quite well for hours the packaging feels high quality the gloss has a faint nougat sweet kind of scent i like this , and would reconsider repurchasing , but would be afraid to purchase online because the color swatches do not match reality based on the swatches i would have expected no 4 to be a very warm clay pink it is actually a very cool dark peony kind of pink not sure whether the color shift applies equally to all the swatches shown , but my experience with no 4 would make ordering online a little
5	hands down my favorite concealer spf 30 that 's way cool ! ! i do n't wear make up i say , and with this that 's true i believe anyway lol i mean its sun block right \? i do n't actually burn but i look like i do , my face and neck are always red regardless of sun exposure so i use just a little color to reduce the appearance i'm a guy so no purse , i carry this in my pocket someday someone 's gonna see it and say you wear make up i will say no i wear a tinted sun screen and it will be true , , that one this stuff covers great and last all day never gets on my collar and is still in place at the end of the day totally covers my red while protecting my skin i'm a lifetime user unless my redness someday goes away but i do n't see that happening so dedicated customer here
4	la roche posay is the sunscreen brand i like to use these days the anthelios 60 sounded interesting with the cooling water like lotion i thought it was cooling , but i did n't notice it being water like , although it is light it says it 's fragrance free , but it still has a sunscreen scent just a slightly medicinal smell i like the spf of 60 , water resistant and paraben free it 's not cheap , but this brand is excellent as a sunscreen recommended
2	tacky and do not like the taste the color was quite sheer too
5	amazing ! works like magic applied to a very stubborn deep pimple and this stuff dried it up to a significantly smaller , much more shallow pimple overnight shocking results usually deeper pimples take almost a week to surface this one never did applied a second time and the drying lotion off the bacteria completely and obliterated the last bit of debris under the skin pimple never came to the surface and is now completely gone
5	absolutely loved my purchase ! ! ! \) \)
3	i am a fan of the baxter products love their bar soap and their hair pomade however the grooming lotion did not do much for me i have medium length thick hair would put on my hair when damp and it helped style it but did not hold for long as others have said it does have a nice scent
5	my skin gets dry and easily irritated , especially on my back and underarms this cleansing bar is like magic i have only been using it for two days and have already gotten relief from itchy and dry skin after a shower , my skin no longer feels tight and itchy it 's softer and smoother so that i do n't feel the need to use body lotion also , it 's gentle enough that i can use it lightly to cleanse my face without causing irritation or tightness this is an absolutely excellent cleansing bar , a tad expensive compared to others but worth every penny that i paid for it i will definitely be buying this again
3	here 's the thing it 's refreshing that 's about it i remember when i was in high school my girlfriends and i used to buy a similar product from evian we thought it made us chic and , it was really nice in the summer but the effects were short lived \( as most would imagine \) this reminds me of those times i used this after the gym and it had a nice relaxing effect for several seconds but , outside of that , it has a limited usage now , i did show this to my dermatologist and she confirmed that while it cannot do anything to improve skin quality \( look to peptides and retinol for scientifically proven improvement \) , it is not harmful \( in any manner \) and will not interfere with the efficacy of other products so , if you are seeking a little pick me up after the gym workout or even on those extra hot days , this is nice outside of that , it seems to have very little purpose \( clinically speaking \)
5	this is a wonderful lotion ! smells yummy and not stickey , makes skin feel so soft !
5	excellent creamy formula very rich but not greasy there is something about this product that actually healed my cuticles i used to have hang nails and the skin around my fingers peeled and no matter what i tried this completely healed my hands and my nails are so long and beautiful now i no longer need cuticle cream does it all i am asking for this and the foot cream for christmas the hand cream lasted about 3 months
5	this is the perfect medium brown color for fall very polished look , and a great change from the normal bright colors
5	love the multi colored sparkles !
2	after four days of using this product as recommended , twice a day , my face is itching and i'm experiencing mild burning i have very dry so i was looking forward to the hydrating power of the juice beauty serum this product has initially worsened my skin condition my face feels slightly chapped as if it were despite the fact that this company boasts of the organic ingredients , which are rich in antioxidants , there are other things in this serum that have the potential to irritate a person 's skin it appears that one of them is having a negative affect on me here is a full list of ingredients organic juices of pyrus malus \( organic apple juice \) , vitis vinifera \( organic white grape juice \) , citrus medica \( organic lemon juice \) , aloe barbadensis \( organic aloe leaf juice \) , vegetable glycerin , organic plant oils of helianthus \( organic sunflower seed oil \) , simmondsia chinensis \( organic jojoba seed \) , butyrospermum parkii \( organic shea butter \) , palmitate , caprylic capric triglyceride , glyceryl stearate , magnesium ascorbyl phosphate \( vitamin c \) , stearic acid , cetearyl alcohol , malus \( apple buds \) , vitis vinifera \( grape buds \) citrus \( lemon bark \) , organic essential fatty acids of oenothera biennis \( organic evening primrose oil \) , linum usitatissimum \( organic linseed oil \) , borago officinalis \( organic borage seed oil \) , xanthan gum , panthenol \( vitamin b5 \) , allantoin , sodium hyaluronate \( hyaluronic acid \) , tocopherol \( vitamin e \) , sodium benzoate , potassium sorbate , ethylhexylglycerin , citrus \( mandarin \) , \( may chang \) and \( ho wood \) pure essential oils some are raving about the positive results they are having with this product perhaps i'm experiencing sensitivity to one or more of the ingredients whatever the case , i'm unable to recommend this serum based on my personal experience if you do intend to purchase this serum be sure to look over all of the ingredients first to check for allergens or other possibly irritants also , be prepared to moisturize after each application especially if your skin is the least bit dry
1	i was so excited to see essie nail polish on amazon i thought i was ordering this barely purplish more reddish wine color as seen in the product pictures but it arrived as an undesired purple i ca n't return it so i wasted 9 on this color that i will never wear i want my money back i always rave about essie nail polish but this was a disappointment just because the photos are n't accurate i guess i have to buy it in store from now on to be sure of the color
5	great summer color new nail polish dries so much better very happy with color it was a risk online i love all things hot pink and this is true to family yipppee
4	always a quality product
4	it is blue green with shimmer
5	this stuff is
3	overall the product works well but right where the handles at be careful because if you hold too high up or move your hand a certain way you get burned ! and it 's hot ! i feel like that 's a bad safely feature ! !
5	i love this for my nails i am able to fix my nails as well
3	i neither like nor dislike the fragrance of this conditioner and cannot even describe what the aroma is like nevertheless , this conditions my fine hair nicely without weighing it down and left my locks soft however , i am also very attracted to fragrance and this just does n't have a strong enough nor an attractive enough scent to make me want to purchase this based on the other reviews it appears i'm in the in not being overwhelmed by its scent
4	have n't tried it yet surprised at the terra color from the outside of the bottle , i thought it would be more muted as soon as i use it , i will report more objectively
2	it is creamy and goes on so smooth , the scent is n't overpowering so far i have found no difference in my facial skin and the moisture does n't seem to last long so my wrinkles appear more prevalent after a half hour or so i feel this product does n't live up to its claims , i can see no tightening my my skin and the wrinkles are not disguised and look actually worse if i only use this product my face started looking so bad that i had to start using my usual products sorry but for my face it pretty much thumbs down on this particular cream
4	i'm a fan of tea tree oil as an ingredient in certain body care products however , sometimes the smell fragrance can be unpleasant and or over powering happily , this is not the case with this product so if you share this concern based on past experience with other products with tea tree oil , know that this product has only a very light \( and pleasant and neutral as it were \) scent i'm hyper sensitive to fragrance in products and this presented no problems either in skin irritation or aroma i like how lightweight it is and how easy it spreads it is really moisturizing but it is not slick or greasy after application , i found that my socks were not stained or by having it on my feet this is not as thick as some other foot creams , which may be a plus for you as the richer and thicker ones can often be a bit of overkill this product reminds me , somewhat , as a more contemporary and lightweight version of a foot cream i got from the de santa in a few years ago that cream is unbelievably effective , but also unbelievably expensive i'm glad to have found this product , which seems to work as well , if not better , than what was my favorite foot cream this cream is especially welcome for use in hot weather some others just feel too heavy on your skin but this feels cooling and comforting \( if our had not died , i would have tried heating it slightly to see how it works when it 's warmed up ! \)
5	dang i love this stuff ! best moisturizer i have found yet and i have tried due to allergies , reactions , breakouts , etc great product line i have the cream wash as well
5	when having to remove waterproof mascara , i usually fall back on the old standard of baby oil or an equivalent oil while they may work ok , i do n't like the scent in the baby oil , especially when it gets into my eyes , or any oil in my eyes for that matter so i was really happy to to try this la roche posay waterproof eye makeup remover , since , right away i noticed it did not appear oily , nor was it scented also , it was labeled as being safe for sensitive eyes \( personally , i believe all eyes are sensitive \) i 've now used this remover several times , with both cotton squares and also tissue , and it works perfectly i have now permanently settled on the tissue , since i do n't like the fact that a cotton square or even a cotton ball can leave small fibers in the eye area and those are not pleasant when they get into the eye , itself one thing to note is that you have to vigorously shake the bottle before using , since it is a bi phase formula \( you can even see a blue layer of liquid on top of a clear layer after the bottle has been standing \) this is a great product , and , while not cheap , it does last quite some time as you do not need a lot of the liquid to remove your eye makeup
5	i am very pleased with this eye anti wrinkle moisturizer i have only been using it for about a week and a half , but i have seen significant results since using it after using this moisturizer , i have noticed the eye areas to feel smoother and look rejuvenated the last anti wrinkle moisturizer i tried did not show me similar results , and i used the expensive product for 2 months the moisturizer is lightweight , non greasy , and absorbs into my skin immediately after application this eye moisturizer is better priced than other moisturizers because it shows satisfying results without breaking the bank i recommend anyone in search of a new anti wrinkle eye moisturizer to give this one a shot in just the short time that i have been using it , i feel better about the appearance of my eyes
5	my wife likes that it is a 3 in 1
5	good grief , i wish i 'd tried this product years ago what formerly took me an hour \( base coat , 2 coats of color , top coat \) and even then was n't thoroughly dry , now took me 25 minutes and it 's dry i mean , i tried to smudge it on purpose , about 3 minutes after the totally dry time , and it did not budge no more pushed away color ! this is a must have for me , from now on
3	this is a unisex eau de toilette it is fresh and crisp at the beginning and dries to a more powdery scent although i like the scent it does n't last long enough because it is an eau de toilette and not a perfume it feels more like a summer fragrance to me
3	what a strange makeup unlike every other product i 've used this compact is about less , not more it is extremely translucent and i seriously doubt that color is going to be a problem for most light shaded women when i first used it i was like , the , there 's nothing here but i was wrong upon putting up my specks i saw something that was pretty cool and that was that it over flaws in my skin but not the way a foundation does it sort of fills in for large pores and discolorations from the sun summary i like where this makeup is heading it 's an intriguing idea but it needs to work a little better for me to purchase it what i don't like is that you have to use your fingers yuck i'm a mom if you 're a mom you know where my fingers have been i do n't want to contaminate my makeup like that also , i do n't like how shear it is i'm a person who wears very little makeup , even when dressed up and this is too light for me what i do like is the minimalist nature of this make pairing it 's cool how it works , i just wish it had a little bit more color
5	amazing product ! i usually stay away from oil product because my hair is fine , and they are usually very heavy this product just disappears into your hair leaving it unbelievably shiny and soft i'm really having a hard time believing it this product arrived during a very humid time and my hair was out of control frizzy this product tames the frizz without leaving that oily heavy feel bravo , , bravo !
3	i received a 10 ml tube purse sized index finger sized not the larger size included in the vine reviewers list , for 120 according to the product description on this page i smoothed a bit on my eyelids and below it went on nicely enough but absorbed very quickly , leaving the skin still a bit dry this product is not specifically for eyes , i know , but it 's a bit of a test , comparing to my usual products \( mary kay and meaningful beauty \) if the product does n't moisturize there , it wo n't elsewhere and besides , i have only this tiny tube
5	dj play that song is a semi neon purple color with red undertones i say semi because it 's not a blazing neon it can be worn to work it looks just like it is pictured in the bottle pinkish purple i tried to take pics after applying but my camera would n't capture the real color i tried in sun shade indoors lights but did n't work the color is really pretty to naked eye saturday disco fever is a bright pure orange color this is not a very blazing neon , so i am able to wear it to work it looks fabulous in sunlight as well as indoors i felt that this color is more suitable for evenings and parties in summer i was a little apprehensive at first because i personally do n't like yellow orange shades but this color worked for me it is more red toned than yellow toned this dark orange looks good on nails too the formula on both the polishes is great two coats are enough for perfect opaque polish they dry quickly but dry matty ish so top coat is a must for me i applied a base coat \( opi base coat \) , 2 coats of polish and a top coat \( opi top coat \) they lasted more than a week on me which is rare \)
4	this is a nice product it is free from alcohol and parabens which is a real plus it has a nice cooling sensation when it goes on and the smell is clean and not overpowering while i like this product , my standard toner is witch hazel which works as well and is significantly less expensive
5	i loved the cleaner and day cream the scent is light and lovely the cleaner does not leave my skin tight and washes away nicely the day cream is light and does not leave a film \( love that \) but i mostly use creams at night except on cold , windy or hot days the peel has 5 uses only and stings so this is my least favorite i do love the way my skin feels and looks after using the whole system highly recommend despite the price
3	nice color , slight shimmer , unique
2	this product is n't my favorite while it definitely gives my face a clean feel , it also leaves a strange film behind i'm also not a big fan of the scent it 's citrusy , which is n't totally offensive , but has some underlying other scent that makes it smell like grandma 's perfume another , on the front of the bottle , it says it 's cleansing , makeup removing , and purifying when i think of a makeup remover , i'm thinking that it can be used for eye makeup do not use this on your eyes , it stings ! my neutrogena toner and grocery store generic makeup remover are preferable to this product i 'd rather spend the money on these two products i know work than buy this one that 's just so so
5	this is the perfect pink and i really love it order and i do n't think you will be disappointed at all
4	i like the color but it is really similar to to sp it goes on a bit too thin but with 2 coats it 's ok
4	i 've tried a handful of lower end spray dry shampoos i have n't gotten a chance to try the more expensive kind , but i do n't know if i want to when i have this powder at first it was n't what i expected a blonde friend recommended it to me and upon first use , i was convinced it was n't intended for dark hair no , it 's great , but there 's a learning curve i actually like the applicator i never apply the applicator directly to my scalp , rather i put some into the palm of my hand and then sort of sprinkle it over areas of my scalp okay , yes this is messier than a spray , but imo , it allows for more precision and this powder has a lot less residue than any spray i know of i think it 's a lot easier to control the amount when you apply with your hands with the sprays spray for half a second too long and now your hair is gross and covered in too much dry shampoo no good i hardly have that issue with the powder more tips on application like straightening or curling , you need to apply a little bit to sections of your hair so i 'll section off a part around my crown , sprinkle in the powder and really pat it around with my fingers do that with the next section sometimes i do get and put on too much either way , i use a brush at the end to better distribute the powder sometimes i do this so carefully and it takes enough time that i wonder why i did n't just wash my hair but it 's still worth it oh and i cannot stress that this is minimal residue ! that 's my favorite part about it other positive while i have n't used it consistently or on a weekly basis , my medium sized bottle has lasted over three years a little truly does go a long way and you really get your money 's worth this does n't get a five star rating because sometimes application can be messy do n't wear black while you 're doing this i'm also looking for the perfect spray but as far as i know , it does n't exist
5	awesome fall color ! ! ! !
5	such an unexpected color but i am in love !
4	this is a wonderfully hyaluronic acid serum , which is absorbed fast into the skin , helps with hydration overnight and makes skin look plum in the morning since i only had a sample , i cannot tell much more about the long term results i do n't regret buying the sample \( i used the credit for another cosmetic product \) , i definitely started liking this brand by trying their samples i compare this to the paula choice hyaluronic booster , which per oz still comes to a similar price but i would buy the paula choice one which is 0 5oz i prefer to get in smaller sizes , since i take a lot time to finish them and i prefer to have smaller quantities to have a product on hand
5	the only polish i can wear that does n't chip off in 2 days it is organic , so that must be the difference
5	love the color
5	thank you , very god
5	subtle fragrance works well it 's hard to find a deodorant stick that does n't leave underarms sticky this is just perfect
5	i love this eyeshadow ! i have been using it for years i love jane iredale cosmetics because i am sensitive and they do not give me problems and they go on so nicely !
5	this works beautifully , even for those of us who are not pros at using conventional curling irons my teen approached it and asked me if she would burn herself with it , as this has been a problem for her when using regular curling irons not only did she emerge without scars , but her hair fell in the kind of loose curls she had of i can tell the competition for this curling iron will be intense
4	i found the smell of the cleanser a little off putting this is typical of organics so it 's no surprise , just a bit hard to take for me my daughter has used it now for three days and her skin has shown a marked improvement in blemishes and in overall tone neither of us cared for the moisturizer and the amount of peel included in this kit is miniscule still , the cleanser and serum work well together and do offer results if any of these items are offered separately , those are the two i would recommend
4	this is an interesting product that requires some experimentation to figure out how to best use for me , mixing with a little lotion to tone down it 's quite tan color , makes a good cover to give me tan legs when i want to show them you need to make sure , however , that you allow about 15 minutes for the color to try , or it will smear on your clothing this is a good alternative to self tanner , though it washes off with a shower , where self tanner lasts about two days \( in my experience \) for me , using this product on my skin works best , but others may like it on their faces as well in any event , it gives you a tan look without exposure to harmful rays
4	i like this obagi lotion and sunscreen it is thick , but not overly so and it it easy to evenly apply all over my face and neck it rubs in completely , even though it contains zinc oxide it does n't clog my pores and seems to wash off completely when i clean my face at night if i'm out in the sun for a long time , i will reapply every hour and i have n't gotten sunburnt at all it comes out of the tube well and i do n't squirt too much in my hand it seems like one tube will go a long way the scent is very mild and i do n't notice it when i put it on i 've been very happy with using this sunscreen and it 's doing a good job for me
5	l'occitaine immortelle precious serum goes to work for you right on the very first day you receive it additionally , it also shows even more beneficial effects a month later , and going forward this serum is an absolute winner ! l'occitaine immortelle precious serum has a beautiful , light and powdery scent it is hard to believe that there are one thousand flowers in each bottle , however there are the serum is not a perfume it is a skin treatment to bring out your skin 's most impressive immortelle precious serum works for you and you in a lovely and effective way ! it does n't quit your skin just gets better and better check it out a month after you begin using it if you are like me , you will be thrilled it works in this manner it begins to show a gorgeous right away , the very first day , on your face i use it on my decollete as well i feel younger , using it , than i have for ages later on in time , your skin becomes more wrinkle free in a month , as i mentioned , the positive results are very clearly noticeable this serum is a distinct wow ! l'occitaine produces some of my favorite beauty products this serum is just beautiful to the eye as any of the other l'occitaine offerings in their treatment line i have and used wonderful l'occitaine for years now it treats you elegantly and effectively , as you should be treated try it once and you will be a devotee it is definitely worth the money and will leave you feeling precious and youthful you will love l'occitaine immortelle precious serum !
5	fast shipping ! loved this color i usually go for darker reds and thought i 'd try something different absolutely love it for fall !
5	i got say i'm pretty impressed it is light on the shin it goes on so nice it lasts a good while without feeling heavy \( hard to accomplish \) but a word to the wise make sure not to apply before your moisturizer has absorbed well i use just coconut oil and it got into my applicator pad , which in turn mixed it into my powder so less than half of disk works right bummer , i finally found one i a normal no make up wearing lady likes i do n't like the feel of make on my skin at all
3	not the color i expected gave it away
5	the in touch cream blush in color named collection seems to be the closest in color to the pure pressed blush named best makeup ever ! !
5	few lotions pack the moisturizing punch of a thick cream but this one does i usually use a combination of oil and cream at bedtime during the winter and still usually wake up with dry flaky legs and arms but this lotion alone kept the flakes at bay i love it and will definitely purchase again
5	love essie products and love this color looks great and lots of fun for summer very bright would definitely recommend
5	best curling iron i 've ever owned ! heats quickly , curls smoothly helps prevent the harsh lines that appear when using drug store quality tools i have longer than shoulder length hair this helps create curls that are formed well loosen gently throughout the day highly recommended !
3	i have pale skin , and this color looks very intense and not very natural even when i very lightly apply it it does n't come with a brush be careful when you do go to use a brush on it , you barely touch the blush and it starts shedding off like crazy this wastes a lot of \( very expensive ! \) product it is also a matte finish my personal taste is to have a dewy , natural finish to my blush so i'm not a huge fan of this product hope this helps !
5	this light pink cream is smooth and rich , but looks much paler on your finger and absorbs quickly into your face the spf 15 is good for daily use but probably not strong enough for the beach it 's pricey so you probably want to use it sparingly anyway you get 2oz \( a standard shot \) for 24 , whereas you can get a bottle of other spf15 cream for 9 12 , even 4oz of your average face sunscreen is easily half the price it 's definitely a pleasure to use , like all the mb products we have tried
5	perfect for me please have it for next time you use have it on when going out
5	dermablend has a great product lineup with some great camouflage blends from heavy to lighter coverage they all feature some amount of spf protection i really like the quality and feel of it it leaves skin feeling smooth and is not greasy nor sticky the texture is silky which is a nice surprise the coverage is excellent and a little goes a long way even applied to hands and neck this works well on most areas it has good water and sweat resistance and stays on well a quick scrub with a good skin cleanser and water washes it off you do have to put some effort into it great foundation and camo professional strength is right
5	wonderful neutral color
5	i love shellac and it 's easy to do at home plenty of videos on u tube to get you going and give you great tips the top coat provides a durable , glossy finish do n't forget to add some extra curing time under the uv light \( two 2 min cycles \) and clean off the sticky residue with 90 isopropyl alcohol for lots of shine
5	brand new as description , love the price !
5	my face looks less tired and more radiant now that i 've added bliss triple oxygen radiant protection serum to my routine i like this formula a lot it 's a pretty peachy , shimmery color , which it may or may not impart on my actual skin it 's hard to say it does plump up the fine lines i have , and i do n't look so haggard by the end of the day , when i use this product , along with my moisturizer and makeup i like to think of it making the job easier that my makeup needs to do my skin is really sensitive , so i always worry about stinging or rashes or of swelling eyes when i try a new product , but there was none of that trouble with this serum
5	i ove the navy blue with just the finest hint of sparkle , not too teenage y looking and perfect for fall !
5	this is a nice toner !
5	this concealer has nice coverage and was easy to apply only one application was necessary color was true to expectations
5	this is the best and finest cream of this type on the market ! once again pca has come through in this area with ! ! love it and must have it at all times in my cabinet ! it did more in two days than another well advertised product did in over a month ! the other product was a terrible joke , if a person is expecting help , thank god for pca products and there quality and honesty
4	a must for shavers with sensitive skin a little bit goes a long way this is all i use for shaving when i use a blade
4	when it says smooth it definitely means it the coverage is great , a small amount covers a large area i have worn it for an entire day , and i do n't think it stays on the entire time but i think it 's still a good product i got the color medium and at first it looked a little dark for my skin but over the summer i tanned a little bit but now its perfect i think the value is good , a little goes a long way
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	avene makes great products , this is for sensitive skin have used it for years and love it because it works ! !
3	while the manufacturer doesnt promise that this cream will make you look a decade younger , they do claim that nightly use will leave your skin looking , rejuvenated and as if you have had two extra hours of sleep vague and rather subjective , doesnt it \? i have normal skin that tends to get a bit oily in the t zone , and my usual nightly routine consists of cleansing , toning and applying a retinol cream in order to give this product a proper test drive , i nuxellence for my retinol cream \( nightly \) for 4 1 2 weeks my thoughts light , non greasy texture that absorbs easily into my skin strong floral herbal fragrance that dissipates after a few minutes leaves my skin feeling moisturized \( keep in mind that my skin is not dry \) experienced no redness , irritation or breakouts do i look \? rejuvenated \? like ive had 2 hours of extra sleep \? actually i look about the same as i did 4 1 2 weeks ago i found this product pleasant enough to use but saw no results beyond what i was getting from my retinol night cream its very possible that my normal routine is effective and im not going to see any appreciable results beyond what i get from a retinol cream , and thats fine i liked this product well enough to finish it , but i wo n't be purchasing it again this might be worth a try if your skin is normal to oily and you cant tolerate \( or just prefer not to use \) a retinol cream i suspect dry skin types will require additional moisture as for that 2 hours of extra should be so lucky ! note because of the container design i cant tell how much product is left after 4 weeks of nightly use
4	good goal or if you like polish without sparkles
3	i have sensitive skin and was a bit concerned about whether this cream would cause problems for me fortunately , i did n't experience any redness or irritation at all , so that 's really good i have fine lines in my neck as one tends to have at my age , so i was rather hoping this would help minimize them unfortunately , there has n't been any noticeable effect other than general moisturizing , which i can get from much less expensive creams it also has a pretty strong aroma for me , but perhaps not for people less sensitive to fragrances
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	very pretty color
4	a friend and i saw this polish on pinterest but could n't find it anywhere we were so happy to see it on amazon it is an awesome neutral color for any time during the year , as well as any occasion you can top with a touch of sparkle for a fancier event !
4	i have been using boc products for a few years now i really like this pack the deodorant smells great i use it in conjunction with a nighttime product and the combo keeps me dry all day i have semi oily skin and the lotion does leave my face looking a bit greasy by the end of the workday , but ymmv it moisturizes really well so i still tend to use it quite a bit i have several clay wax pomades and the included clay pomade has made it into my rotation i have fine hair and i have found this one is best applied to damp hair then i use the hair dryer to work it through my hair and give it some hold
4	this t3 micro twirl convertible curling iron comes with a 1 25 straight barrel with clip that is suitable for creating waves , waves , or volume with curl in very long hair \( the included barrel is totally for use with my short hair and bangs \) the handle can be used with any of four other available barrels \( currently priced at 85 each on amazon \) for classic , full length , bouncy and defined curls , you need the 1 straight barrel with clip for bombshell , full bodied , sexy style waves , you need the 1 5 straight barrel for uniform spiral curls , or mermaid or defined waves , you need the 1 straight barrel for beachy , textured , natural looking waves , you need the 1 25 0 75 tapered barrel the barrels are easy to insert , and are locked in by a sliding ring at the top of the handle the barrel clicks when properly locked into place the locking ring has markings that indicate whether the barrel is locked \( for use \) or \( for removal and of barrels \) warning this curling iron heats up really , really fast ! being unfamiliar with curling irons , i burned my fingers by briefly touching the barrel \( accidentally \) before the led lights stopped flashing to signal that the barrel was heated and ready for use unfortunately for me , this twirl convertible model does not come with the heat resistant protective glove that is included with some other models because of the high temperatures achieved , this appliance should be kept under lock and key in with children there are five temperature settings , ranging from 260 degrees f \( for damaged or chemically treated hair \) to 410 degrees f \( for normal to thick hair \) it 's easy to change the settings by double clicking the power switch and then clicking to cycle through the led lights indicating the temperature settings to turn the curling iron off , you hold down the power switch until the led lights go out \( oddly , the instructions do not say how to turn the appliance off \) using the curling iron requires holding the handle upside down over your head , and then wrapping a strand of hair around the barrel by holding the end of the strand with your other hand some manual is definitely required ! the curling iron has a built in stand flat on the top of the handle and the tip of the barrel that allows it to be placed on a level surface also included is a pad that is probably intended to further protect any table or countertop when the curling iron is set down on the stand this is a good thing , because the stand is clumsy to use the curling iron has to be placed just so for the stand to keep the hot barrel off the level surface there is an auto shutoff feature that turns the curling iron off after one hour this is a beautiful curling iron , one that works fast and creates nice waves however , because the stand is clumsy and there is no protective heat resistant glove included , i rate it at 4 stars \( i like it on the official amazon scale \)
5	thus worked great to help me smooth out my hair after wearing it in a bun or ponytail if i put my hair up for even a short time it gets kinks in it well this heated up quickly and slid right through my hair brushing it and straightening it all at once my hair looked smooth and glossy afterwards and it seemed to last all afternoon this is a really great way for a busy mom to keep up with looking put together , without stress and money and time i love it
3	i was very excited to try this lipstick ! however , the shade did n't really come out on me like in the picture on my lips , it looked like a bright , cool , pink purple i have pale skin with warm tones so this was pretty much the worst shade i 've ever tried on me personally i left it on for a while to see how it felt , and after about 30 minutes my lips felt pretty dry and waxy i think if you have cool toned skin and want a bright shade , you should try this but be aware that you might need to apply clear gloss to keep your lips hydrated feeling hope this helps !
4	all day coverage ! i finally have tried dermablend ! it does cover very well the trick is finding the right shade or shades for my mixed race skin i do need to remove this every evening without fail or my acne has a fit and the hyperpigmentation spots i believe this does it 's job as advertised , i just need to do mine to have the best mature skin possible
5	great
1	saw on dr oz so ordered it very disappointed though did not fill in at all made no difference would return if it was n't such a hassle
2	did n't like the flavor and texture of it , felt old dry
4	nice but not my favorite
5	i have been using this for three weeks and i have noticed softening of my wrinkles they can be deep harsh lines and this has made them look smoother and less defined hopefully over longer use it will soften them even more it smells like rose it comes out very liquid and only a tiny bit goes a long way it does make your skin feel greasy i like it the most on my neck
5	alcohol free toners are a mixed bag for me some of them are ineffective for my oily summer skin but so far , this one has been great \( which is good because i have an absolutely huge container of it that will likely last months , even used twice a day \) it is moisturizing and non drying but it has some fruit extracts , including fruit acids these , i think , are critical \( see the full ingredients list by in on the product image of the back of the container \) they have some mildly astringent properties that actually tone tighten the skin based on my experience , but they also do a bit of gentle exfoliation if you have sensitive skin and ca n't take strongly acidic toners , this may be an option for you \( i am a big fan of exfoliators , especially gentle ones like this because i sometimes go overboard with the scrubs and have to dial things back a bit but it is hard to go overboard with this type of product as long as you apply it with a gentle or non cotton pad \) this really is the orange color from the photo , which is sort of unusual for a toner , especially one without artificial dyes so i think there are tons of fruit based antioxidants in this , which is awesome for a little extra measure of protection from free radical damage \( e g , from sun exposure \) of course you should also use a sunscreen when using this product i find this to have a mild but pleasant scent that does not stick around for long after application it does not irritate my eyes at all \( of course i do n't get toner in my eyes , but sometimes if other toners get a bit close , they can sting this one does not \) i use this morning and night after cleansing i follow with an essence \( this is a step in korean skincare that i have \) , a couple of serums and or face treatments , and a moisturizer in the morning i also use a sunscreen , a primer , and foundation this product does not interfere with the application of any subsequent products , as long as i allow it to dry adequately before continuing \( it really does not take long to dry also , a little goes a long way you do n't have to use much \)
5	product was as described
4	while this hand cream seems a bit expensive for the amount you get , etc , it is quite nice i like really that it is unscented it seems to last a while however as others have noted , if you wash your hands shortly after applying it , it will wash out and you can feel it doing so
4	i have fine long hair life occasionally requires me to it into an within minutes of the finished products , hair begins to escape i tried this as a holding gel and was pleased that it held the flyaways but did n't give me helmet head i really like the scent that admittedly is not feminine the combination of grapefruit , sage and ginger really worked for me my husband has curly hair which is difficult to tame and somewhat thinner than it was i his younger years i convinced him to try a little and he liked it a lot he 's not a hair product kind of guy but recognized the brand we are both using it now and are both satisfied
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	i like this but will go to oribe directly next time
5	this stuff works ! so much better for occasional adult breakouts than anything else i have tried put down the ! a little goes a way just dip a q tip all the way down to the bottom of the bottle to touch the pink part of the liquid \( do not shake \) dab on affected area it immediately dries note , it ai n't pretty , and you will have a pink dot of what appears to be dried calamine lotion on your face , but its totally worth it just do it before bed and wait for the vanishing act to happen !
2	this is a very expensive anti aging wrinkle cream unfortunately , after using it for several months i still do n't see much of a difference
2	i found out two things upon trying this the other day first , it is very powerful after two short squirts , two rooms in my apartment were bathed in the scent for a good hour secondly , upon smelling it , my 18 year old daughter said that it reminded her of my father , her grandfather i felt the same way it 's heavy on the musk and very strong neither of those are my choice qualities in a men 's fragrance currently , i use boss and low black they are both clean and fresh smelling , which i prefer , plus a bit unique , which is also nice to not smell like everyone else to each his own , and i my personal preferences as a point of comparison for your own
2	the anti acne ingredient in vichy normaderm beautifying lotion is 1 5 salicylic acid i generally use a product with 2 concentration , so i did n't expect this lotion to be so drying my skin began flaking and peeling after one use and that 's not all that unusual with a new anti acne lotion , but even spacing out applications , after more than a week it 's not any better i'm going back to my higher concentration , but somehow gentler , regular product
3	this men 's cologne was a bit too spicy and bold for my taste i liked that ck one had an understated , light scent a little spray of this leaves a strong impression not a good thing when you work in tight quarters with other people there was also too much alcohol in this product , that was part of a scent profile calvin klein should reconsider 3 5 stars
5	i love my clarisonic device and the way it the use i get out of the facial products i buy is amazing my skin is very sensitive and i need to be careful about which brush heads i use if i use one that is to harsh it will cause redness and skin will even break out from the irritation the sensitive brush heads are amazing soft enough that they do n't irritate my skin but effective enough to get rid of impurities i love the fact that they are just as efficient with my facial cleansers and serums as well they suggest replacing the brush head every three months so the four pack would last you a year , so when that is considered the price is reasonable when you take into account you can actually use them longer than three months \( sometimes six months \) and they will be just as effective it makes it even more affordable
5	this dermablend smooth liquid camo medium to high coverage foundation makeup with spf 25 covers my skin discolorations and a facial scar as well as various other skin challenges first off , you really need to go to a store in person to find the right color for your skin dermablend makes a wide range of shades and the color must be spot on to get flawless , undetectable coverage after you find the right color , you can order it online forever but the right color is crucial there are many stores that carry the dermablend line i 've been using dermablend 's camo powder foundation for 3 years now because it covers very well and is quick and easy to apply this liquid version takes a little more time to apply and blend but i think the end result is a little smoother and more even i am using a makeup sponge and i apply a fairly light layer and get a medium coverage i have skin discolorations from melasma as a result of having 7 kids and dark , under eye circles and a facial scar this provides good coverage with a light layer i can get complete coverage with a few layers but i hate wearing heavy foundation i use a setting powder and it lasts the entire day don't skip the setting powder because it 's what keeps the makeup from rubbing off or settling into lines and creases \( dermablend makes a good setting powder but really , you can use any loose powder for this purpose \) i will still use the camo powder foundation for daily use because it 's just so fast and convenient but for times when i want to look especially good , this will be my go to foundation
4	this ck2 fragrance is a new 2016 twist on older ck products indeed , and perfumes smell differently on people and even objects i had a very mixed reaction to it in the beginning and after careful , extended of the fragrance can rather classify as a more feminine product there are noticeable and of rose , citrus , and violet leaf that make this spray more feminine yet , there 's a noticeable base fragrance of sandalwood that gives it the overall masculine undertone and caused it to be classified as unisex it 's a complex formula that upon spraying immediately you with a sharper fragrance , but after a minute a two it mellows out significantly it does not have a strong sillage but has a good longevity overall the scent and what makes things smell attractive to you is a very subjective thing overall , like any other cologne or perfume , it is that you smell it first before ordering it i personally did n't fall in love with it my teenage daughter , on the other hand , really likes it
4	i have n't used a mask in many years , so this was an unusual experience for me the product has a very faint smell of apples , but a much stronger waxy smell it is n't unpleasant or overwhelming this seems like something that is n't too perfume y for a man to use anyhow , the directions are simple , smear it on your face and neck and wait 10 minutes before removing it the hardest part is the 10 minutes wait with a goopy face i thought the effect was slightly refreshing without being drying the mask is n't overly astringent feeling , and did n't leave the skin under my eyes feeling raw as for blemish clearing abilities \? well , it 's three days later and my skin is pretty much the same as usual greasy around the nose and chin , dry under the eyes , with a few annoying spots by my hairline that 's okay , since i'm not enough to believe that anything can really your blemishes the best you can hope for is a bit of control this mask seemed to do okay on clogged pores , without further clogging them , and my face looked smoother immediately after the treatment it 's not a miracle cure for blemishes , but they do n't make that claim anywhere on the box the product is certified organic and does n't contain anything you ca n't pronounce , so it 's not like you 're smearing chemicals on your skin i 'll use it on a weekly basis as it does make my skin feel cleaner
4	i am a female , but this intrigued me so i gave it a try it has a very pleasant , natural scent the serum is thin , but not greasy , and it spreads well a little goes a long way it dries fast , and you ca n't even tell it 's on your skin , after you put it on i do n't have many imperfections on my skin i was hoping this would improve the youthful look of my skin i truly did n't notice a difference in that area it works really well as a primer for makeup , so if you are already using a primer , and decide to give this a try , you can use it as a replacement i love the scent , the consistency and the quality of the serum it did n't do anything for me , but it may be that i do n't have the problem skin that it is meant for i see that others say this works really well for them if you think you have the skin this is designed for , then give it a try based on the quality of the actual serum , i would recommend it
5	literally cannot live without this stuff now it keeps my sensitive skin fresh and moisturized it 's helped the redness from my rosacea immensely i spritz several times a day , even over makeup it keeps my skin looking fresh and dewey i just bought travel sized to take with me on trips
4	i tend to like fragrances in the calvin klein line , as i generally find them to be very high quality and long lasting i was excited to have the opportunity to try a full bottle of euphoria , a scent i had only sampled in the past but had liked very much euphoria is one of my favorite ck fragrances it is very sweet , so those who do n't enjoy sweeter style perfumes may not like it however , i find it to be sweet not in a young or girly way but in a manner that is quite feminine and sophisticated the fragrance description lists euphoria as having exotic fruits , and i'm not sure that i get that from this scent black orchid is also listed , which seems more likely to me \( although i do n't know that i 've ever smelled black orchid ! \) i would also agree with the rich , creamy part , as there is definitely a richness to euphoria that lasts all day in fact , one of the things i love about euphoria is its staying power the fragrance remains potent for hours and hours , often still being detectable the next day ! so why only four stars \? as mentioned in my subject line , i absolute hate the bottle so much so that i was tempted to take off more than just one star for that ! apparently , the bottle is a piece of art designed by yes , it is pretty to look at , but as far as using it goes , it is extremely non functional first , i'm not surprised that the designer is male does he think women have a single perfume bottle that we display as an art piece \? no , we put the bottles together in drawers , on bathroom shelves , etc not only is this bottle an awkward shape and size but also it does not stand flat on its own that 's right , it rocks ! i could actual live with that issue if the atomizer part worked correctly unfortunately , just under the spray nozzle , there is a very cheap plastic piece \( i will try to add a photo of this later \) , i think which is supposed to hold the cap on well , this piece does not work properly , as it is loose and leaks if i try to push the cap all the way back on as designed , it makes things worse very frustrating ! again , i do love this scent and would recommend it i would suggest either buying the smaller \( 33 oz \) size , which comes in a simple , purse sized spray bottle , on be prepared to the larger size if needed
4	i wanted something to add a bit of sparkle to my hair and this is perfect ! it 's very subtle \( unless you get carried away \) and i 've also used it on top of my blush for evening wear i do n't think i 'd want to put it all over my body but for a touch hear and there it 's quite attractive it 's exactly what i was looking for !
4	the packaging both box and bottle have clean clear lines even the plastic that draws up the perfume is so clear , you have to look closely to even see the straw ' the bottle has a sweet little hang tag , and the cap fitted properly i do have a signature sent , an old favorite from jean , joy , and normally do not wear a perfume on a daily basis , as any sent , if you work in a garden attracts when the toilette burberry , the beat was offered from the vine program , i selected this toilette , i find that in the evening , after bathing after the garden work , this is a refreshing , light and breezy in scent it does last a while as i can wake up to a nice fragrance i would describe the scent as a fruity , nature scent clean and refreshing the one con would be the price for a toilette , i am used to high prices for a perfume and lower prices for a toilette of course , time has marched on for this old and seems like all have given rise in prices for a special gift , for a special person , i would recommend this recommended , i liked it
2	i tried this product a couple of times , each time i put it on over my makeup , but i have to say that it did n't illuminate my skin as expected , i honestly could not see the difference to my skin after applying it other than it added a different color to my skin it was easy to apply \( it looks like a pearly lotion \) it comes out through the small brush after you press on the end of the applicator , and even though you 're suppose to use the brush to distribute it , i also ended up using my fingers to smooth it into my skin i noticed that the color actually looked a little bit lighter on my face once applied \( i'm a brunette and i had the nor color \) additionally , after applying it , my skin did n't feel any softer , if anything , it felt a little tight i honestly do n't think it 's worth the price and i would not recommend it
5	meg 21 smooth radiance face treatment , 1 7 fl oz is a great product this is the first of item of their line that i have tried and i must say that i am very impressed with the quality and results very simple to use apply on your face , being careful to follow directions and over applying one pump is all that i find to be the required amount it absorbs nicely into your skin and leave a really refreshing feeling i do not have many wrinkles but its good to know that this product will help to keep it that way or even better , remove the few that i do have meg 21 smooth radiance face treatment is worth the price i have used other expensive treatments that did not really act any better than cheaper products you can buy at your local store this one is definitely a high end , high result product very pleased with it
5	i'm a huge fan of this facewash it 's so refreshing and leaves my skin feeling so clean i have very oily skin and wear foundation so a lot of products just do n't feel like they are getting my face clean to the surface the menthol in this feels tingly and amazing be sure to keep your eyes shut tightly because the menthol will sting your eyes the wash is a gel and becomes foamy once you start massaging it in a little goes a long way , so although this is a small bottle i have been using it for a couple of months now i like to mix it with any wash that contains exfoliating beads to really get a clean feel then you can use even less of this product and get the same menthol effect because of the menthol and the acid , this is not good for people with dry skin it definitely helps reduce breakouts for me the scent is clean with the overtone of menthol
1	do n't buy this ! mostly perfume samples , and if , like me , you never get the promised credit , you 're out 20 for samples you would n't take for free
4	i had used retinol creams that i got from a dermatologist years ago and i remember it took me a while for my skin to get used to it at first you might peel and get a little red , but over time \( and gradual use , do n't use every night at first \) it can really help the only reason i stopped is because i was going out in the sun too much and you really cant do that while you 're using a retinol cream i was interested in trying this because i love skinmedica products and know of their stellar reputation this cream does go on smoothly and it felt great but the bad news is that i had an immediate bad reaction even though i was careful and barely used any i waited a few days before i tried again but it was only worse what happened to me is that it made any broken blood on my face redder than ever and made me look very flushed , almost as if i had rosacea , which ive never had before i immediately stopped after that so i do think that this is very potent stuff , but that it can be very problematic for those of you who have sensitive skin like i do and especially if you have any on your face
3	i bought the 5 day detox kit so i could try a lot of the skyn iceland products this is an all right moisturizer for nighttime if you do not have dry skin it has no spf , so it 's not really appropriate for day wear it has a quick cooling effect i'm not sure this is actually doing anything for the skin , but it feels nice i have been using this as a sort of serum under a richer cream before bed have n't seen any changes to my skin using these products so if you have dry skin , this lotion may be one to avoid , especially at this price
5	good stuff love the dropper it makes it easy to place the oil in the palm of your hand and apply from there smells ok but could be refined works well
5	the anti aging skin care industry is full of luxury products claiming to restore skin using various botanical and formulations this product sold me by having 10 french and its unique combination of , and poppy when used as a night cream , the general benefit is to skin cells while you sleep the result is a revived complexion in the morning my wife is the primary user of this product she had very positive results from its use her skin is noticeably smoother with a glowing complexion on the downside , she is sensitive to many products so far she has had no negative reactions to the product i am aware of the concern with animal testing of cosmetics and i think it is a horrid practice i did some research on nuxe and found that they do not test their products or ingredients on animals during manufacture but they do in testing with the finished product when required by law \( certain countries like china require this \) the scent is light and mostly the box has multi language descriptive and instructional text but the could be better overall this appears to have a positive affect on my wife 's complexion and i have had positive results as well i would recommend it for night application with or without your normal moisturizer do note that results will not be instantaneous you will need to give it some time to work
5	i use this product mainly just for eyeshadow and to outline my eyebrows , and it is awesome i could see someone using it over concealer \( if applied lightly \) or even used as a base under a smokey eye , or even natural eye it is sooooo pigmented with beautiful champagne shimmer i am going to try the other shades soon !
5	i had this color done in a salon before i purchased it i almost did not buy it online because the color i see on here looks nothing like the color on my nails i was so sure i got the wrong name off the bottle , but i did n't ! this color is a really beautiful teal , not a light to medium blue with a slight hint of turquoise just thought i 'd give you a heads up so you do n't get sad when the color that shows up at your door is teal instead
5	burberry body tender milk is like a light lotion , packaged in a beautiful glass bottle with a apple floral , slightly spicy fragrance with some subtle musky undertones i like it because it is n't a sweet scent i love the smell of some sweet perfumes on other people , but they do n't seem to react the same with my body oils and seem overwhelming after a very short time this one stays fresh smelling even after wearing it for hours it does n't seem to last all day , but perhaps that 's because i grew accustomed to smelling it and do n't notice it as much after a while the glass bottle looks luxurious on my dressing table it has a pump type applicator that dispenses a drop or two of this scent at a time which is the perfect amount the scent is light and rather delicate and never seems overwhelming it seems sophisticated , a scent suitable for business or formal wear that 's partly because it is n't too strong i think a person would have to be standing close to smell it rather than noticing it when you walked into a room this is the type of fragrance i like
5	this is a great product they a speedy delivery
2	i have been using this morning and night for about two weeks , and it does seem to provide some tightening to the skin on my neck it feels very similar to some night cream that i have used , so i think it might have some similar qualities as that type of anti aging night cream lotion this is a small container that will not last long however , even with a short time of use , i think it has had beneficial effects however after the two weeks it seems to have a thinning , effect on my skin , so i'm taking a break from it i have used it on my neck after shaving and it is soothing also but the recent effects are concerning the area around the bottom of my neck and top of my chest has begun to redden after using at night , i notice in the morning that area of my skin is red like a sunburn so i'm stopping the use of this
4	i'm pale think the following foundation shades , fair , snow white yeah , like that pale so , when i say that these type of sets tend not to work for me , you can probably understand why so , with this in mind , here is my experience a \) i love the way these pieces slide together to create a single unit while it is a little difficult to see this here , even the lipgloss slides into place ! and , when all locked into place , the entire set is about the size of a deck of for me , this is incredibly convenient until receiving this kit , i has a small cosmetics bag in my briefcase that was filled with very similar items and was taking up about three times the space in my briefcase therefore , this is a welcome change ! \( more room for energy bars ! ! \) b \) the lipgloss is gorgeous it seems that this product would complement anyone 's complexion i has a very similar lipgloss a few years ago it was from stila 's kitten collection i am so thrilled to find a near ! it has a little shimmer and feels great on my lips awesome ! c \) the tint and are also lovely again , these seem fairly universal , require minimum effort , and deliver a genuinely pretty appearance additionally , they seem to last a typical length of time \( i do wear a powder over my foundation , so that may help these stay put well \) d \) the bronzer for me , this was a no go it was so dark that it made me look like that tan mom from new even with a light , light touch , i still looked bananas however , this goes back to my introduction i am super pale so , know that this could look amazing on you e \) no brushes included i have two bare minerals brushes that i added to this kit , but i now the bag \( which i love \) and the individual pans are kinda dirty from the brushes rolling around in the bag with them bummer i wish there were one or two little retractable brushes included \( i have a benefit blush that has a little brush in the top of the container now , it 's not the ideal shape brush , but it works in a pinch i wonder if something like this could be an option \? \) so , while the bronzer will go unused , the rest is truly amazing \( and , i'm keeping the bronzer part since the large mirror inside it is super handy \) ! and , as a final note , these pans seem really resilient they made it through a long shipping process without a crack and have been in my briefcase for about a month now without a break i keep waiting to find one of the powders destroyed \( since i always toss my briefcase on my desk or on the floor \) but no such thing ! this set is bound to attract some s and s why not set the trend in your school or office right now \? ! these jouer products will become your new obsession !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	i do my own nails at home and love cnd shellac it is a great prodct and truly does last at least 14 days my nails always look amazing and i get a ton of compliments i also love the colors and the option to layer and create new colors is awesome this is an effect it is a clear polish with a gold glitter effect
4	the coverage is very good however , i find that my sink has particles in it after i use it , and it does come off on my pillowcase however , it does wash out
5	this has been my go to cleanser for over a year , and it works great for my combination skin at the moment i'm using the combination code facial cleanser , which i'm also having great results with would recommend either product for combination to oily skin
5	love it
5	this is such a lovely highlighter ! as you can see from the attached photo , it has multiple colors in it , and creates a lovely , soft glow i'm slightly obsessed with highlighters and have quite a few in my collection , and this one reminds me the most of hill 's champagne pop highlighter i'm fair and cool toned \( i wear mac foundation in nw20 \) , and this adds a nice warmth to my skin it also does n't cake up or feel chalky on my skin , which is important since i'm in my mid 40 's and worry about powders settling into my fine lines i'm really impressed with this !
5	we love this baby shampoo because it washes out easily nothing is worse than a baby shampoo that requires lots and lots of water to rinse out so that the baby loses patience and starts crying in the tub this shampoo cleans well but washes with a few rinses of clean water in fact , we like this soap so much we use it as an overall body wash as well the smell is also pleasant and not too strong
3	i have not had much luck recently with commercial fragrances , as they all tend to smell the same with my body chemistry , sort of chemical like and cheap since i tend to gravitate toward woodsy or floral type scents , i thought maybe a fragrance that claims to have a more fruit based scent \( asian pear in this case \) would be different i was wrong josie smells fine in the bottle , but when i apply to myself , i first get a strong alcohol smell like i had spilled rubbing alcohol in the room then the alcohol smell goes away , and i am left with a scent that is hard to describe it is not asian pear , nor is it citrus , but more of a can of tropical fruit salad smell this fades quickly and is followed by a floral scent , like freesia and hyacinth mixed with ivory soap on my skin , it smells absolutely nothing like the matching body lotion did which is a good thing not a terrible scent , and it did not give me a headache like reveal by calvin klein , but it is not for me it does smell better on my clothing , , and as an air freshener than it does on me it does not even smell nice on my daughter , on whom the body lotion smells wonderful guess i will have to stick with perfume oils
4	i 've always used budget drugstore cleanser and did n't have high expectations for this but was pleasantly surprised i do wish there was a pump because everytime i'm careful and still pour out more than i need at this price point i do n't want to be wasting product the scent is really nice , smells spa y and clean and fresh without being overpowering it definitely is a scent for everyone the cleanser itself is clear and very silky smooth , it felt really great and gentle on my skin it does n't have a foamy soapy lather but it does n't need it even though it felt silky while washing my face and i thought it might leave a residue , it did n't leave any and completely rinsed all away it made my skin feel amazing nice and clean and not overly dry or tight i actually felt nourishing for my skin the bottle claims to remove makeup but i did n't find that to be the case with eye makeup , so i still use an eye makeup remove then follow with this i was n't expecting it but after a week of use i actually felt like i 've noticed a brighter complexion ! time will tell if it continues to outperform my budget cleanser but so far i'm very pleased with the nourishing and gentle results !
4	having a baby is real hard on a mothers body i remember my telling me it takes 2 years for a mothers body to recover from so i ordered this mustela stretch mark prevention cream for my daughter in law that was expecting she just recently blessed us with our first grandson he was a large baby , and she is a tiny , petite young woman she told me she has some stretch marks but that she 's putting this cream on everyday and it seems to help she told me that she was using a different cream , but she thought the mustela was better than her other product plus she 's more of this cream since it 's more natural and paraben free and wo n't hurt the baby while she 's breastfeeding mother and baby products are so advanced since my days , and i'm so happy and grateful for that thanks mustela !
5	i think this is a really great scent for those who enjoy what i would classify as clean or fresh smells it is quite potent and long lasting you definitely do n't want to overdo the spritzing or you will regret it later there is something in this that seems to remind me of the perfume in a good way i like both a fun note for those who like to collect bottles the alligator is actually
2	first the vials are a mess , and the company needs to do a better job packaging it inside their container the shipping box was pristine so this is not a shipper or amazon issue luckily none were broken actually using the product for close to two weeks first person me , had to stop after a couple days because my hair scalp started flaking very badly i was using it in front where i'm getting just a little bit of a receding hair line somehow my skin did not like this at all with that a huge fail , i have had another member of the household try it who has very thinning hair she seems to think her hair is getting a little stronger , but into the 2nd week we have yet to see objective results in before and after pictures i suspect products like this working or not depends a lot on what causes the problem , prolonged use , and a healthy dose of believing the ingredients are all natural and organic , so who knows if there is real un scientific study to back this up i hope the fda starts regulating these types of products so we can know more if things like this should work this is awfully expensive for 1 3 of a product \( the amount of product needed to see result \)
5	some people have commented that the polish was watery , not the case with the one i got i bought it as a back up for my pedicure in case i chip i can do a touch up worked just fine
4	a little bit of this goes a long way i have very thick , wavy hair that is often difficult to tame about a dime size of this worked into my damp hair at the roots and another dime size amount worked in from middle to tips and that 's all i needed \( my hair is about 3 past my shoulders in length \) then i blow dried it and my hair was much smoother i did n't get all the little flyaways in my part and my tips did n't frizz out this stuff is a bit pricey , but it does work and gave me smoother hair however , i do usually get 2 3 days out of a single wash , but with this stuff , my hair was noticeably the second day , so i only got 1 2 days out of a wash while using it
5	i love all things image these products are really great i have reviewed this one before so obviously i have repurchased this one it hydrates and plumps the skin ca n't go wrong here
5	this lip lacquer is not anything like your typical lip gloss it is richer and more pigmented than a gloss and the application is more precise and smooth with the included brush as for the texture , it goes on easily and dries to a soft , matte finish but not one that is too drying like many other long wearing lip products what impressed me the most is the intensity of the color i usually wear a similar shade lipstick under my gloss since most glosses fade so quickly not this one this is the first lip gloss that i have used that can stand alone as far as color longevity while it is not as intense as a traditional long wearing lipstick , the color does last and is perfect for a natural look that is still polished the 04 shade is a nice , soft pink that i imagine would work well for most skin complexions fyi the online photo of this shade appears to have a bit of brown in it but it does not while i normally think luxury lip glosses are not worth the premium price , this is not your average lip gloss and is worth consideration
2	on the one hand , this product does n't burn or cause skin irritation on the other hand , it does n't do anything at all
4	i love putting this oil in my hair just a squirt in my hand , and then through my hair it smells so nice and leaves my hair shiny and soft there is no greasy feel in fact my hand does not even feel greasy from the application i took off a star , but not for the product or the seller for the packaging i wanted to travel with it and i was afraid of the pump i contacted the seller who told me to push down the pump and turn to lock it in but , this is n't so easy to do and you can pump out a lot of stuff trying i ended up putting some in a travel container it worked just fine
5	this is the perfect pink and i really love it order and i do n't think you will be disappointed at all
4	leave in cream is excellent at leaving my hair frizz free throughout the day especially like this when it 's very hot and humid , my hair smooth and free of any tangles , also leaves my hair with a nice shine i like that it does n't weigh down my hair or leave it looking greasy the reason for my 4 star rating is because the pump did n't work from the day i recieved this but i was able to find another pump that works very good other wise this works great , even on the worse hair days
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	when i opened the box for this i thought really \? they could jack up my face and run a new one under it for that price the bottle is a little bigger than my thumb i suggest you do a test patch on your inner elbow before you put this on your face you can read the ingredients by the thumbnail photos on the left of the product page you wo n't be able to read them on the actual box without a powerful magnifying glass when they say oil that 's what it is , about the consistency of mineral oil it has a very subtle citrusy scent after cleaning my face i only use a couple of drops to cover my face \( if you use too much you will be a greasy mess and it will take some time to absorb \) over that i use a vitamin c serum then , after a little time for that to absorb , i apply a moisturizer it leaves my face warm and a little pink for about five minutes the results \? first i have to tell you i'm leery of any cosmetic that makes extravagant claims so i was n't expecting much i am pleasantly surprised after just a week my skin looks much better the fine lines at the corners of my eyes are less and a line on my forehead is less obvious is it the oil or is it because it helps the c serum to absorb better \? i do n't know but whatever it is it seems to work is it worth the cost \? i'm still debating that
5	i 've used moisturizers before and i try to take care of my skin and while i thought those were good , baxter 's night cream was much better than anything i 've used it is a thick cream texture , is n't greasy and a little goes a long way i use a 3 8 squeeze from the tube , which is enough to cover my face it absorbs quickly and well , so i can go about my business and not get anything on my pillow i either ca n't detect anything but a light scent or there is none added , so it has a very light to no scent my skin is on the oily side and i noticed that it was a little less oily after a week of use i'm sure it has more to do with the aha , but my skin looks better i think so and others have noticed as well my skin is even and just looks better , healthy people mostly commented like most baxter products , this is a good quality and will last longer due to using less so while some might look at the cost and think twice , it is actually a pretty good value
5	great moisturizer for rosacea , post laser \( after 5 10 days \) and to use over retin a
3	this concealer stick appears much lighter than it was pictured if your skin is a lighter shade then it would be good for under eye concealer as for deeper marks it does not do such a good job it does not cake which makes it a better concealer for the more delicate areas of your face
5	my favorite fragrances tend to fall into two broad categories rich oriental spices or masculine scents with notes of cedar , tobacco and or leather even in the summer , i do n't gravitate toward lighter perfumes that are fruit or floral forward therefore , i was hesitant to give this one a go , since the top note is berry but the list of base notes \( sandalwood , musk \) intrigued me enough to go for it upon first applying , the ultra sweet berry is very prominent , which was a big turn off to me , it smelled a bit juvenile and cheap but after a couple of minutes , it dried down to a very warm , sophisticated scent as the base notes came to the front my husband commented that the fragrance was very sexy plus it has real staying power \( sillage , as it 's called in the industry \) , which is a big selling point because even some of the most expensive perfumes can fade away after an hour or so my only real complaint is the packaging it 's extremely the gold bottle , the mesh bow and the pink plastic juicy couture logo it 's all a bit much but you ca n't always judge a book by it 's cover this is an exceptional fragrance and a very good price
2	too drying and not effective
5	this is definitely an upscale product , after a perfume and for significantly more than your average lotion what are you paying for \? mainly the brand , and , the perfume if you care about brands and like this perfume , then this product is for you the scent is mildly floral , feminine , and soft , and fans of eternity will enjoy this as for the lotion , it is fairly standard in that it moisturizers and absorbs into skin very well there 's no greasy finish , and your skin will definitely feel soft
5	thanks
5	i have been using my lavender \( sensitive \) foreo luna 2 for about a week i did n't even need that long , really , too review it from the first use , my skin was super soft i was actually surprised to find my skin so soft i could n't stop touching my cheeks ! i have pale skin that turns red easily i used it on the highest level , and it did not cause any redness or pain to my sensitive skin i use it as a cleansing tool place your regular cleanser all over your face and then run the luna 2 over your face it kind of pauses quickly when it thinks you should move to the next section i would say that i ignore it , because i use it longer than suggested once done with cleansing , you rinse off the cleanser i semi dried mine and then used it again on my face for the anti aging of use use it in areas that commonly have wrinkles i left the power turned all the way up , so i would n't have to keep adjusting it
5	bought i for my sister , she loves it , i have bought it several times for her
5	i have a very pale complexion and many make me look like i am going off to entertain at a children 's party this is a more natural look which i appreciate
3	when it first comes out of the bottle , the perfume smells strongly of alcohol and reminds me of cheap perfume , but then it gets subtler and you 're left with a light , fresh scent it 's ok but kind of bland it comes in a rather plain minty glass bottle with the lacoste logo on it an alligator patch if i did n't know it was for women i would have it was a bottle of cologne for a guy overall it 's ok but the scent is not particularly interesting
3	not sure about the washing part the fragrance was so strong that my husband and i were on it when we opened the bottle not a bad fragrance , mind you , but way too potent just could n't get past the first kiss with this one
5	i have had dark circles under my eyes since i can remember certainly since my teens i 've tried a variety of concealers , powders , creams etc , but nothing really worked everything just my raccoon eyes this pen the color of the makeup seems to really help it 's pretty yellowish and looks too bright going on but with some light blending , it not only disappears into the skin \( at least my skin \) but also lessens the dark circles nothing will make them completely disappear \( short of a magic wand \) but this makeup really helps especially when used in conjunction with at least a basic application of other makeup i am glad you do n't have to use much of it to make a difference , though , because the one flaw is the cost i understand you get what you pay for but this seems overpriced to me and i ca n't justify buying it too often
5	must have in your medicine cabinet !
3	this oil and based cleanser removes all traces of makeup and does not leave skin feeling stripped it is an impressive makeup remover i have issues with the aesthetics , though the first time i used it , i kept wondering when it would start to foam because it felt like i was still rubbing oil and water on my skin i finally opened my eyes and in the mirror to find it was indeed foaming i ca n't feel it changing on my face or with my fingertips i 've used it a good two weeks now , and that has n't changed i know that after i add water , it will start foaming , but i ca n't tell when that happens it is impossible to rinse off unless i use a washcloth i can see the makeup is gone , but water beads up on my face i appreciate the softness , but i really do n't like leaving cleanser on my face , so i scrape it off with a wash cloth yesterday , i noticed the safe for symbol on the back of the bottle this symbol looks like a jar , and has a number followed by the letter m this symbol is not on all cosmetic and personal care , but i find it more and more often unfortunately , according to the safe for symbol on this bottle , the cleanser is safe to use for a mere three months after opening i think the average consumer will wind up wasting a lot of product exceptions would be multi user
4	great product great shipping thanks
5	love it ! ! amazing
2	very thin , streaks and dries slowly , slowly
5	i got this for my girlfriend to try because she loves the various shea butter hand creams that l'occitane makes each year for christmas i get her one of their sets with lots of different scents in it and she never seems to use anything else this seemed like a natural , but she was hesitant at first as it apparently has very little shea butter in it but she still thought it might be too oily as she does n't have dry skin however , she thinks it works just fine , cleans without drying her face , and she was pleased that it washes away easily and does n't seem to leave any oil
3	i enjoy using the product but i am unable to say if it really helps tighten up the neck i am still on the first jar and have not noticed any improvements
5	great need it for your nuface love mine ! use it with your machine !
5	pretty classy nuetral looks good on my light olive skin tone im in healthcare and this looks clean and professional essie always pleases !
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
5	great product !
5	this balm body cream for extra dry skin from la roche posay really is exceptional for super dry skin it comes in a 13 , plastic pump bottle that dispenses a thick , ribbon of cream with each pump the cream is white and has just the faintest scent but no fragrance added it feels a little tacky on the skin at first but within 5 minutes , it has absorbed completely and leaves no tacky or greasy feel la roche posay says this provides moisturizing and protection for up to 48 hours but in my experience , i want to reapply every 24 hours , which is still quite exceptional amazingly , this cream can be used on the body and the face i do n't have dry skin on my face but i can see that even for my oily skin , this would be great on my face to protect against winter wind i use it on my feet and heels , which get very dry and even crack in winter this cream is wonderful and heals cracks in dry skin with continued use i really like that it 's non greasy when completely absorbed so my heels and feet do n't slip around in my shoes apparently this is also very good for , which a member of my household has at times she said within 2 days , she was seeing improvement in a patch of my only complaint is the bottle , which is made of a thin plastic that is fairly easily damaged my bottle had a spot of on one edge that fortunately , did not cause a full break but i can see how it could easily happen i hope la roche posay will consider a thicker bottle because this is excellent cream for extremely dry skin and the price is reasonable , imo , considering how much creams and lotions can cost
2	i hate to dislike a free product so much , but i really dislike this eye cream first off , it smells like latex paint which really is off putting to me i am interested in natural and this brand touts itself as natural and healthy , so why does this smell like latex paint \? i really dislike that secondly , when it put it on the area that has crow 's feet wrinkles , it stung a bit i could feel it tightening the skin , but it felt like too much acid or something definitely irritated my skin thankfully my skin did n't get red i actually did n't see any difference , i only felt it i really do n't tolerate this eye cream well at all which is a shame , because i was super excited at the of a free high end eye cream back to caudalie for me
5	i just watched a video of bobbi brown doing makeup on older women and she showed that using a heavy rich cream is okay , that it plumps up the face well for makeup application i'm one that usually uses that at night but for this last week , i 've used it during the day , under makeup , and it 's not heavy like i imagined it is thick but it does n't feel once your makeup is on i also used less makeup , just a smidge of cc here and there and a bit of concealer the plumping of the skin made my skin look more radiant than usual me , radiant \? \? \? that said , i really like and i'm a price this is a good price for a good cream , others at the makeup counter are much more expensive for example , i last tried an estee lauder heavy cream that was so heavily scented that it made my eyes tear up \( why fragrance in moisturizer \? \? \? \) this has no scent and has a bigger container that feels much nicer and the price was much less it 's not cheap , but even drugstore brands are comparable in price for this have you priced olay or roc lately \? i 'd never considered vichy a bargain brand before but it is great and high quality
2	very thin , streaks and dries slowly , slowly
4	i'm not huge on body fragrances but the smell of this interested me it 's a very sweet smell so if you 're not okay with that then this will not be for you it says indian rose and honey and that is exactly what i can smell the scent is like an exotic rose and if you think about it when you 're smelling it you can get honey from it as well i 've decided that i do like to miss this on my body as its subtle and it does n't last a really long time i have also decided that misting my linen with this , as in my bed linens , is not for me it is too sweet to try and sleep with it has a pump sprayer and it really is a very fine mist when you spray it i ca n't imagine using more than a couple of pumps at a time the bottle is made of glass and is pretty heavy from visiting a in france before i believe i did learn that plastic and light can be of perfumes so this make sense overall , this is pretty delightful and we will definitely get use in my home
5	this is an awesome primer it 's light and glides on easily i use it with a clinique foundation and my makeup lasts all day looking great and it does n't cause any kind of irritation or breakouts i wish i had discovered this years ago
3	it does not take my makeup off as well as a plain old baby wipe does ! it will leave your face moisturized and clean , but it also has a floral scent that i can take or leave
5	initially when i first bought it , i thought there would be no color pay off since my lips in my opinion are pretty dark since a lot of lip products , or at least the ones i have , either do n't give me color pay off or is the same color as my lips naturally but nope , 3 juicy apple gives me a really nice pretty tinted lip plus it 's pretty moisturizing ! only downside is when you get your gloss bar , there 's this seal on it and the seal tells you your product 's but once you throw the whole seal away , you wo n't have the number anywhere on your gloss bar so i recommended cutting the part of the seal that had the and stick it to the bottom of your gloss bar
4	love this color i could n't find it anywhere in the stores it was sold out you need a top coat for sure !
5	excellent product
5	goodbye rub ! unlike powder , this lotion stays with you and does n't need to be applied a day i love the fact that it keeps you dry and comfortable and does n't make you feel like you have something on awesome product !
5	this is my first julep product , and i am super impressed with this amazing blush called petal pink i wear a minimum amount of liquid makeup and add a blush for extra color , as i'm very pale my go to brand for many years is usually l'oral , but julep is going to be a close favorite the brush application over my cheekbones was fast with beautiful results , better than my other brand i only needed one quick swipe and the amount of color produced was just right that has never happened before ! the color looks very natural especially on my many decades old , face so the age defying is really a point for me , but i must say that your happy look is right on
5	i have extremely thick hair that resists lathering , so i can only report on this shampoo from that particular this shampoo is a clear gel that does n't have too strong of a perfume and made tons of rich , thick lather on the first shampoo my test of a good shampoo , though , is if you can open your eyes while using there are no stinging eyes with this shampoo , and it cleaned my hair thoroughly without stripping it i did not have the wow conditioner , so i used my own \( \) , and my hair came out shiny clean and very manageable , even though it was a humid day where i live this is a pretty pricey shampoo , for sure , but you do n't need to use much \( about a quarter size dab makes loads of lather \) , so it will last a long time in summary , this shampoo did a wonderful job getting my hair clean with one shampoo and left it soft and easy to manage good stuff !
5	perfect for a soft pink look for everyday or special occasions
5	love it
5	long wearing and easy to apply formula love the essie line was not able to find in the local store fast shipping and brand new bottle
3	i tried to give this a fair rating , but after a few uses with irritated skin and no noticeable difference , i gave up i am a firm believer in natural products only , but will make an exception if a product actually works this one has a lot of scary sounding chemical type words , but a quick research on the skin deep database shows that it 's mostly safe if you do n't have terribly sensitive skin like i do , give it a go it just may work for you
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	im giving this 4 stars i like it , and its a good quality pencil i just do n't think it goes above and beyond or is really any better than the other eyeliners i have i just paid more for this one its true , its long lasting but so are my other cheap ones it doesnt smudge which means when you draw that line on beware and be careful because theres no smudging it out for a smokey look or wiping off to correct a mistake i like it but its just a regular eyeliner pencil and overpriced at that
4	just used this for the first time with a fresh fusion pro glide cartridge i had previously been using aveeno positively smooth shave gel , which i'm pretty sure is marketed for leg shaving it is a great product and like 5 at every local pharmacy first and foremost , the jack black does not foam lather at all i'm guessing you need to use a brush and hot water i'm fairly certain this was marketed as a product , similar to art of shaving also , a small amount creates a thin film over your facial hair that dries very quickly this resulted in me using significantly more than the pea or dime size amounts referenced by other reviewers the downside to using such a large amount is that you need to constantly rinse your blade because it gets clogged up so why the 4 star review \? probably sounds like i regret buying this 25 jar of creme fraiche the end result was fantastic while it did take a little longer than i'm used to , my skin feels smooth and moisturized i will look into getting the jack black brush to match in the near future i'm hoping using a hot towel pre shave and using a brush to create a more noticeable wet lather will improve my experience for what it 's worth , i had looked at art of shaving , l'occitane , and kiehls before making this purchase i would recommend trying this , as it is priced and made with quality ingredients but do n't expect to be blown away when a dime sized amount does n't cover your face in a thick foamy lather as other reviewers suggested
5	adds amazing shimmer like rose gold not gloopy love this and will wear during summer and at night
3	pretty color but did n't cover well
3	i am still getting used to this shaver so i 'll list what i like and do n't like and add to the review if changes my opinion what i like i love that i can take it into the shower and that it is cordless i like shaving in the shower because shavers and razors seem to grab less when my skin and hair is wet but sometimes i 'd rather shave under my arms in front of the mirror because i can see the places i miss the combination of going anywhere and especially in the shower is a major plus for me i like the little piece for doing longer hair given the things i'm not so wild about , i think it will be a long time before i try a bikini shave , but if i have n't shaved all winter and am getting ready for spring , that attachment definitely comes in handy what i did n't like this is the first electric shaver i have ever used i 've been shaving with a razor my whole life and i think there may be a learning curve on how to hold it , but the leading edge caught on a large skin tag under my arm and cut it i also manage to catch just regular skin under my arms in that leading edge and keep getting places that are almost like razor burns later on they turn into sore red lines under my arms i am hoping that practice will teach me how to shave under my arms without tearing them up a shaver does n't give me the exfoliation that a blade does so my skin does n't feel as smooth as after i have shaved with a blade the convenience of this shaver will eventually overcome this but i did notice i was n't feeling quite as smooth because the weather is still cool , that is n't as much of an issue but later in the spring when i use self tanner , i 'll want more exfoliation to keep the color longer i 'll just have to exfoliate my legs other ways i should point out that my leg and under arm hair is fairly light in color and texture i waxed my legs for years and the hair never grew back as thick or dark as it had been and my under arm hair seems to have gotten lighter as i have aged as well
1	i really loved the color , and that 's why i gave it one star after i put the polish on , it was bubbly , it was very thick to put on , like polish does when it gets older , really disappointed since this was my first essie polish purchase
4	la roche posay water cream foundation offers excellent coverage and blends easily your fingertip the liquid is creamy and easy to dispense small amounts from the tube this 30 ml tube , while it may seem small to some people , will last me a good 6 months , if not longer , as a small amount of this product goes a long way this feels light on my face , as it should because i only dabbed with my fingertip twice , to cover problem areas honey is a bit darker than i would have expected i would choose a lighter shade with this brand next time
5	i 've been giving everyone in the family a mini spa treatment and it 's been great fun the guys initially balked but then they relaxed and ended up enjoying the pampering and results since the family complexions from from china doll fine pores to acne prone teen skin to old dad skin this vichy clay mask got a good workout to sum it up briefly , this is a great product it 's easy to use and gentle only me with my super dry skin would have to be careful of how often i used it the jar you get is filled with a grey clay mixture when i applied it i found that i really did n't need to use that much the mask particles are extremely fine and glide on there 's no feeling of piling mud on your face , and absolutely no grittiness the fine layer that we were applying felt good and after it was washed off everyone commented even how refreshing it felt both teens had pimples at the time and the irritation and the bumps were reduced afterwards if you 've never tried a mask before , i suggest you start with this one it 's superior to every other mask i 've used
3	this polish is watery way more so then the other colors maybe its a fake i do n't know i should have bought in store
4	it did pretty good but i think my eyes are pass anything that get
3	this is stuff is a bit sticky , but works pretty well if you have shorter hair that you want to style so , if you wanted a or something that is standing up , this stuff is perfect if you have thin hair and want some texture , this works well , but not for multiple days , as they suggest for my longer , thick hair , it just made it kinda greasy and did n't really work well
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	a nice little brush that did n't on quality badger hair is a for safety blade shaving and you should n't have to leave your brush home when you travel baxter of california makes it easy to pack your badger with an aluminum case and smaller than usual brush head that does the job amazingly well just be sure to dry the head before it in its aluminum case to avoid damage this is a great brush and would make a nice gift as well
5	find your color and try it i do n't leave the house without it it 's really quite remarkable !
5	thanks
4	i have recently switched from kiehls to jack black as i use many other jack black products and nordstroms carries the jack black soap so easy to purchase the jack black is a slightly smaller bar than kiehls and it seems to not last as long however the jack black smell is much better also i like jack black as it does a good job scrubbing where the kiehls soap is like using sandpaper on my body and it can actually be painful at times all in all i prefer the jack black scent and level of will continue to use jack black as an alternative to the jack black that i use several times a week
4	quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut ! i received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp i stumbled across this stuff on amazon and bought a competitors as well this one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one this was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result my hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a out i looked terrible ! this stuff actually created the illusion of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back it is worth a try ! hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer step 1 shake over your washed , dried , and styled , hair like you are in a back and forth motion step 2 pat gently but firmly into place step 3 wipe any product off your forehead , ears , neck and be prepared to do it again step 4 seal it with a mist of quality hair spray \( you do not need theirs ! ! \) paul mitchell freeze and shine worked great ! allow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer ! once dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose ! you 're now good to go ! yes , your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal , but for me i did n't care this saved me from a lot of embarrassment and i recommend it to at least try i do n't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on , but if you still have hair , give it a go ! buy two shades and use them together !
4	i naturally have dark circles under my eyes even though i could have had 9 hours of sleep genetically , i have dark circles so i actively look for a concealer that has nice coverage for this area that withstands all day in a humid environment although this is moisturizing and does not feel as if its drying out my eyes , the coverage is n't as great as i would prefer for minor imperfections , this would work great maybe for slight acne scars or some redness but for dark circles or a freckle , i do n't think it would be that effective overall , when compared to other concealers i have tried , it goes on smoothly , does not cake or clump , and feels light
1	broke after a few months
3	this is a light lotion with some little sparkles in it just a little shimmer i did n't really think the shimmer was all that easy to see you need to give it a shake before applying it did n't leave a greasy feel , no strong smell not exactly sure what this is all about , some sunscreen , some shimmer maybe to brighten a little \? like i said did n't really notice the shimmer , did n't think it was all that moisturizing either it is pretty in the bottle to look at \) there is nothing really with it , but just not sure what good things to say about it
5	i like to keep my routine simple just because i do n't stick with complicated i was concerned that this product would dry out my skin but it is refreshing and feels great i used this line of products before the toner and i can say that it does make a difference i even like it in the cold midwest winters
2	smells nice but made my skin too oily not sure if it was pevonia 's toner or this cream , or the combination of both , but my skin did n't like the ingredients and reacted adversely
5	this goes on a little white but as you smooth it in , it disappears this is one of the most comfortable facial sunscreens i have ever worn it has a very silky smooth feel no scent i had no sunburn on a very sunny day i like this plain or with a drop of dermablend flawless creator pigment drops mixed in it makes my skin look excellent im getting really good protection from the sun at the same time a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dermablend flawless creator pigment drops makeup 10n liquid foundation dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dermablend flawless creator pigment drops makeup 10n liquid foundation a
3	i prefer to make my own custom scents from oils , but i was curious about this perfume the bottle is pretty and the spray function works fine the scent is definitely a safe choice as far as being able to wear it at work or family functions not offensive or overpowering there is nothing wrong with it , it 's just too basic for me the scent is more reminiscent of vanilla and powder than amber and sandalwood if you are thinking of buying this , shop around there are better prices on it elsewhere
2	tried this after becoming very disappointed with the \( art of shaving \) shaving cream line this was n't the solution ingredient list has all the right stuff , but i find the lather to be extremely weak very very small layer of protection even when i use a generous amount of cream ca n't even use my badger brush and a bowl to bring a healthy lather , just wo n't work experimented with proper amounts of water several times to see if i could find the right consistency , but could never find it i would amount this to being the shaving cream i will continue my search as this product just was n't for me the art of shaving provides a better leather , but is very drying this product makes canned gillette creams look like the cream of the crop
5	nuxe 's hydrating energizing moisturizer is a rich honey scented cream with comforting elements it soothes the skin instantly and absorbs completely jojoba oil , moringa oil , camellia seed oil , soybean oil , flower extracts and oat kernel are the in this healing cream once you try a product with moringa oil , you may find yourself looking for more information if your skin feels dry , this is one of the best creams and it is especially effective as a hand cream the rebecca review
5	here 's something where a little goes a long way the foundation comes with a spatula and directions were to warm it up by mixing on the back of my hand before using it does a good job of concealing the best concealer i 've ever used just blot , blot , blot i had a bear of a time washing it off my hands , though it is water and soap proof i was able to remove it off my face with makeup remover
3	i 've never actually used primer before and truthfully do n't know it 's full purpose i started putting this on before my moisturizer but have not noticed much of a difference \( was i supposed to \? \) it takes a little while to thoroughly rub into your skin but afterwards it does feel very light and not even noticeable after i 've finished with the moisturizer and a little bit of foundation i hardly notice i 've put it on at all i like that the ingredients are all natural and it 's fragrance free which is very important for me as i hate harsh scents of any kind for this price , i'm not sure if i will purchase once i run out of it , especially since i'm not really seeing a difference in my face after wearing it for a few weeks i'm still optimistic though and will see how things progress
5	i love a good lip gloss and this is absolutely perfect the applicator has a small indentation which makes application easy this has a very light fruity scent this gloss glides on it is not sticky or too shiny i have medium skin tone and this color is perfect and i personally think will compliment any skin tone this is one of the best lip glosses i have used
5	this is another ahava product i love i 've been enjoying this brand for many years these are high end products the jars are n't glamorous but the are some of the best i 've ever used this is a white whipped cream moisturizer without sunscreen it on skin contact into a smooth thin lotion it leaves a slight film on the skin which is very smoothing and softening there is a very slight herbal fragrance which quickly leaves i enjoy using this i actually had been using ahava foot cream on my face and it is fantastic in this use so this is also a great moisturizing product
5	great product my favorite
5	there is a slight smell to this water i realize you can use micellar water to clean your face and nothing else , i always feel like i am still dirty when i finish with micellar cleansing water it is not drying to the skin the slight perfume smell is not overpowering , it fades quickly this is certainly okay for sensitive skin this is great on nights when you are so tired washing your face seems like far too much work the only thing i do n't like is that always have that dirty feeling afterward , i have tried cotton balls for , cotton pads , and a small face washcloth i just feel yet , but that is not the fault of the product , so i am not knocking off stars for my own tastes and preference
3	you know , in moderation , i actually really kind of like how the 18 21 man made wash smells there are n't a whole lot of manly body washes out there sure , there are a lot marketed as being for men , but you have to wonder what kind of guys buy the stuff \( think beast aftershave from ii a lot of the stuff just does n't manly \) do n't get me wrong , 18 21 man made wash is definitely some sweet smelling stuff , but it 's an odd \( but appealing \) mix of vanilla , honey and tobacco that together up images of and blends the scent itself seems overpowering the first time you sniff it , and honestly , to me it was a bit overpowering when i was actually washing with it , but it rinses off well enough and just kinds of mellows when you 're done with shower time it 's still very noticeable , but both my wife and daughter said something about me smelling good as soon as i walked out of the bathroom i generally keep myself pretty clean , but i'm not used to that kind of reaction unfortunately , actually using the wash was n't the best experience it did n't lather up well at all i have very soft water , so things generally foam up pretty easily , but in this case , i had to apply it to my hair twice before it would even work up a moderate lather trying to get it to lather up applying it directly to your hands is a seemingly effort , and i ended up using a whole lot more of this than i should have , and despite the fact that i used a good bit , i still went to the bar soap to work up a decent lather for washing the areas it might be better with a wash puff of some kind \( a manly option , indeed \) , but overall it just did n't seem to do a great job it did rinse off well enough , and my skin does n't feel dried out , but it also does n't feel particularly moisturized i liked it a bit better using it as a shampoo , as it did leave my hair feeling clean , soft and great smelling \( at least according to my wife and daughter \) i would still use a separate conditioner , as using it alone does leave it feeling a bit dry , but my scalp does n't feel itchy \( which it generally does unless i'm using a dandruff or dry scalp shampoo \) all in all , the 18 21 man made wash makes for a pretty good shampoo , but only a halfway decent if it lathered up a bit better and i did n't have to use so much of it to get halfway decent results , i might like it a good bit more , but as it is , the scent is the only thing about this that 's outstanding
4	my wife has been using retinol type products at night for about a year and her skin is not easily irritated so she was excited to try this product by skinmedica my wife has n't really ever had any negative reaction to the skinmedica retinol or to similar products she likes many of the skinmedica products because they seem well formulated and effective on her skin type , mostly dry but not sensitive she has been using it for about two months and her skin feels softer , less dry and tighter in most areas she thinks her fine lines are looking better overall , she thinks this skinmedica retinol is worth the price !
5	thanks so much !
4	jouer cr egrave me eyeshadow crayon is a soft beautiful accent for your eyes it does not pull at the skin where your most delicate it lasts nicely too did not have to touch up often
3	this is waterproof sunscreen ironically that 's kind of why i do n't like it on the positive side , it 's unscented , creamy , and the 40 spf kept me from burning in triple weather i hated that the sunscreen felt sticky on my hands i kept wiping my hands on my towel , but it took awhile until it was gone works well but the sticky feel makes me choose other sunscreens
5	it does a great job getting the skin clean without leaving that dry ish , stripped feel it has a nice light aroma that could be described as fresh floral the scent is light , so it wo n't linger long which i prefer great product
3	the colors are nice , but the brush is worthless does n't matter much since i have a set of brushes that i prefer to use anyway , but the quality of the eye shadows and blush are worse than the cheapest drugstore makeup i have ever used nyc , wet n wild , etc , are all better than this
3	the main reason i got this is because it 's advertised as non sticky lip gloss it 's very sticky , and it does n't last more than 30 minutes before i have to reapply the gloss the color \( charming \) does look pretty on my lips in fact , the color is darker and prettier than shown on my monitor for the color , i gave it three stars if it had n't been sticky , or if it had lasted longer , i would 've given it more stars
5	i can report that i have used this serum for a couple of weeks , and i can actually sense a reduction in the size of my pores that is what i was hoping for in general , i see an overall improvement in the appearance of my complexion , and i have had problem skin since i was a teenager i would definitely recommend this , because a little goes a long way i do n't think i 'll continue to use it every single day , but i do like the effect this is a winner !
5	best cleanser out there for us rosacea sufferers ! ! ! ! good price , well packaged will order again definitely ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5	this is a great moisturizing cream it 's rich and thick and better yet , it lasts for hours i can put this on under make up as well as on my neck and hours later i can still feel the softness on my skin this is also a great nighttime moisturizer this is a very versatile cream for day or night use it works flawlessly under make up and it works very well in conjunction with the vichy neovadiol magistral elixir these two products together are wonderful and are useful in the anti aging i 've had not breakouts with this product as i have experienced with other moisturizers and this really works to soften dry skin i had a cold where around my nose , my skin got chapped and dry but this cream cleared up the dryness in no time this is a really wonderful moisturizing cream that i ca n't say has had any drawbacks for me , only benefits so far
5	the older one gets , the thinner the hair , especially for light complected people like me also , when aging one tends to pay less attention to fine details like the eyebrows however , to me , the brows are even more important than eye liner , which i gave up years ago \) but i insist on that perfect on the brow with medium width hairs i ca n't stand the look of the very thin lined brow reminiscent of earlier ages thin lines tend to age the entire face , imo i see a lot of young girls who pluck their brows too thin , instantly aging them and from the eyes hmmm since my brows are so light it 's hard to pluck them just right , but i have a tool that helps with that too \) after i pluck them , applying this excellent pencil is easy the color is perfect for my coloring no reddish cast as some blonde pencils tend to produce as excellent as this product is for me and other blonde gray women , it 's the shape of the brows that make a huge difference in the brightness of the eyes i love this pencil and the little sharpener that comes with it is a nice bonus highly recommended for fair skinned , lighter haired people reviewed by betty dravis , march 27 , 2014 author of grand
5	this product is always a staple in my nail ! give you a perfectly ready nail bed to start your gel manicure
5	the color is really beautiful , it lasts a lot , doesnt fade i always buy this nail polish and have never had any concerns about it
5	cnd goes on smooth and stays put for weeks this is a great base product , much better than the gelish just a warning though your nails might suffer damage if you use the shellac all the time
5	i used this powder over a dermablend blurring mouse and it worked together beautifully all day i had thought the color might be off when i opened it but it went on and looked great i used a brush to apply it but it does come with an applicator sponge in the base of the compact and there is a mirror above in the lid of the compact if you want to carry it with you for a touch up this is a excellent cover powder
5	this is my favorite essie polish in the orange family it is perfect for fingers and toes in the summer stays on well too
4	definitely a full coverage stick long lasting , even on a sweaty hot day only negative is that it 's a little drying to the skin otherwise i like it and think it 's at a great price point for the quality
4	other than the color i like this lipstick well , no , there is another issue too when i twisted it down \( it \) , the color did not go all the way back into the tube this is not a problem as far as storing it there is about 1 2 of free space in the end of the cap , but it just does n't look right and it does seem a little worrying anyway , i had expected a kind of bright on the amazon photos , but the reality of london is more of a watermelon or strawberry pink on with a rich saturation of color , and the product is always easier to apply than a traditional thicker bullet after application i blotted my lips on a piece of paper just to check the color , and was left with fairly significant pigmentation and a nice dry feel \( similar to my usual rouge lipsticks \) next in the market for a new lipstick , if i can find a store selling the vincent longo products in person \( will be easier to check color \) , i 'll consider this brand
4	my skin gets really dry when it gets colder , and the older i get the more vain i am about having good skin i would tend to use and just lather up with that but figured that i should do a better job this vichy serum is first rate a few sprays and my skin feels marvelous without feeling like my hands are gross from the excessive cream and i can spray it on in the morning and my skin feels good when i go to bed there 's no real odor to it nothing that 's bothersome to me and i'm pretty sensitive about odors from perfumes and the like the only downside is that it 's a bit pricy i have a hard time it for just myself , so when it 's done i 'll look at what else is in the same category that 's cheaper and potentially try it out if money was no object , i 'd gladly stick with this
5	this is my second bottle of nail envy prior to nail envy my nails would break and flake i could n't get them to grow past a certain point not matter what now my nails are a lot stronger and have grown past the point they would n't before
5	first off , i have the regular sized nuface so already knew i loved the results i choose to use an aloe vera gel instead of the included gel i wanted a more natural option that i could feel good about leaving on my skin as long as i have enough aloe gel , i really do n't feel any of the micro current when i do feel it , it 's not overly uncomfortable , just noticeable think of it like exercise for your face it only works if you commit to it ! but it works ! hang in there , give it a week or so of consistent use this mini is a great travel option or one that i can put in my gym bag very pleased !
5	i love essie for the quality and colors and i love that amazon often has a good price pleased with my polish
1	not worth the money
5	does a very good job , especially when used in conjunction with proraso pre shave and after shave i use all four flavors green , white , blue , and red spice is the variety of life and i enjoy rotating through different products and experiencing what each has to offer buy proraso products with confidence
5	great ! this stuff is great i use it when i'm not quite up to the mb glycolic acid toner \( which is also great , but stings my face uncomfortably so i'm sometimes reluctant to use it \) makes my skin feel really clean without drying it at all smells amazing , very natural and not like chemicals
2	very strong fragrance serum is nice , lightweight and a little goes long way cream is rich , perfect for dry skin or as a night treatment i do n't like the cleanser not good in removing make up and it feels like a bar soap on the skin overall i would n't buy it as for active ingredients they seems good , but there was no visible impact on my skin i use skinceuticals , is , dr and kate pricey but they do not make my skin feel only good , they actually make a change with clinical studies behind \( especially skinceuticals \) i know vichy from europe when i grew up and i liked it this brand now i am an esthetician so i know more about skin , ingredients and importance of ph in products my advice go to a good med spa for consultation and invest in good products your skin will thank you
5	this scent is a pleasant flowery sweet scent that i think is more for a man than a woman it is a modern classic in my opinion i doubt anyone would hate it you either like it or love it
3	i'm only about a week into using this regimen and have very mixed feelings my skin feels softer and smoother i expect that with longer use it will only get better the products have very little scent , a good thing i likely wo n't be buying any more of it though it is half again as much here on amazon as it is ordering directly unfortunately , ordering directly from the company sets you up for repeat there are no instructions on what order the products should be used , so it is a guessing game there is no info available on the website either there is no cleanser in this kit , just treatments my skin loves it so far , but my budget does not i will continue my search for a more natural less chemical y skin care regimen
2	dries my skin out really bad
5	my skin is super sensitive and i have always had acne when i started using natural and organic products in high school my skin cleared up right away then that company went out of business and my skin started up again this started kit was great love the although watch out it is very liquidy the moisturizer is intense but wonderful a little goes a long way very mild and did not cause any irritation scents are almost non existent
5	this polish wo n't come off once applied , and it looks exactly as pictured my only qualm with the product is that it is pretty thick when you 're applying a coat
5	very nice powder that provides light coverage with what can only be described as reduces the face appearance so commonly encountered with most powders instead , looks more natural and dimensional
5	i love nail polish \( what girl does n't \) and this pretty , girly color stays on fabulously i 'll definitely be ordering more in other colors
4	this neck cream does seem to work although right under my chin does n't look much better , my neck itself does look better and firmer with fewer lines
4	works well probably the best feature is that it dries quickly so many of theses self tanners have a terrible odor but this one does not , another plus exfoliating prior to application is important , especially if your skin leans to the dry side apply in circular motions instead of up and down to avoid any lines it lasts about three days and then tends to have a blotchy look it was shipped in a bubble envelope and leaked all over so some product was wasted since this is a bit pricey , waste is an issue
5	this product is a minor miracle worker i'm only sorry i did n't discover it years ago i have dark , fine , straight hair and i absolutely cannot be seen in public without my hair being being freshly washed i 've colored my hair to cover some early grey over the last few years , but in the last few months , the grey is popping through much more quickly i 've been told it 's because i wash my hair every day , so i went looking for dry shampoo alternatives i thought about getting the bumble and bumble product because i like their shampoo , but the reviews are awful on that one i'm so thrilled i discovered this oscar blandi product it is amazing i took the advice of some others here and put the product into my hand first instead of directly into my hair i rub in lightly into my palms and then into my hair it takes three separate squeezes for my hair , but again , that 's because my hair is greasy the day after i wash it the end result is wonderful it 's not like actually washing my hair , of course , but it really dries up the grease and gives my hair body i can easily go an extra day between washes now , which is going to make a huge difference in how my color holds over time thanks to all the reviewers here who took the time to write about the product , and to the manufacturer for making such a great product i'm now an every other day hair washer !
5	love jane iredale and her just kissed line love the color
4	i 'd like to start by mentioning that the older reviews are for a sample size kit , not the full size kit that is currently offered i'm not sure why the two share the same space , but the older comments may not be accurate this set comes in a nice gift box , and the products are securely locked into place it took a bit of effort to get them out the brush is very nice , made with natural badger hair it 's soft , but holds up well under a hefty load of shaving cream the shaving cream lathers well , and it feels different it feels cleaner it also goes on well without the brush , but the brush makes it a more luxurious experience the products smell nice , but are not overpowering we tried the lavender scent and it 's fresh and masculine without being too floral or harsh sometimes lavender can smell medicinal , but thankfully this one did n't the 4 step process results in an amazingly close shave and soft skin ! it takes a little longer to do it this way , but the results are worth the extra time it 's a pricey set , but a little goes a long way this should last a while still , we think it 's probably not going to be an everyday routine it 's good for pampering , and it might also be great for someone with sensitive skin that ca n't use inexpensive drug store products the quality is very good
2	i do not care for this shampoo it is so thick that it is hard to judge how much to use also for the price , i expected more i will not purchase again , i can get better results with a less costly shampoo !
2	i do n't particularly care for this product i did not notice any hydrating feature , in fact , it sort of sat on my skin rather than blending it in
5	i love this scent it is classic , masculine , elegant , wonderful the scent is long lasting this is a quality product that would definitely make a nice gift however , i'm keeping it for myself i know it 's marketed to males , but as a female i 've always preferred scents like this i also use it to scent the house and car
5	the best nail strengthener i 've ever used ! ! my nails would break so easily , so i would have to keep them trimmed really short i wanted a little more length so i decided to try this i picked mine up at a local store i absolutely love it ! ! my nails are strong now and i have the length i want because my nails are n't breaking now ! i noticed a big difference after a couple of weeks i would highly recommend this to anyone with weak nail issues this can be worn alone or under polish
5	the color is nice and stays on a long time unlike other polishes i have tried would definitely buy this again
5	this product is the clenziderm face wash cleared my skin i have spend so much money i products that claimed to work for acne i will never try anything else again i 'll stick with this for a long time in fact i need to reorder another bottle since it last a very long time
4	when i got this cleansing oil , my teenage inner child popped up and told my plenty something self you 're going to get zits if you put oil on your face ! happily my inner teen was completely wrong this is a very light oil and it massages into the skin easily and took my makeup off really well people who are used to a squeaky clean feel to their skin may be after i rinse it off , my skin feels soft and a little bit moisturized , but not oily i'm not sure how this would work for someone younger who has oilier skin , but for women of a certain age or older , this is a good product i have been pleasantly surprised by how well it works it does n't feel like it strips the natural oils from my skin while it is cleansing it update the more i use this , the more i like it my skin has been looking better and i think it really does a good job of cleansing i'm still surprised that oil is good for cleansing but am a believer it is a little pricey but i think i will have to keep buying this when my bottle runs out
5	i purchased this for my husband and he loves it ! the pump is nice as it does not clog or get crusty the product works really well and leaves his face super smooth and soft
2	i purchased this product when i read a review on amazon com well , i do not find it as amazing as the reviewer did i hardly use it now i love the butter london products , but this is not my favorite
5	i have used this for a while now , and it works great
5	excellent lotion sunscreen very moisturizing but does n't sit on your skin making it feel greasy it absorbs relatively quickly and most importantly for me for my sensitive skin , it does n't cause me to turn red or break out as with much cheaper creams
4	this versatile product works as a light moisturizer on it own or as a product booster it is a lightly scented gel that applies easily in the summer i like to go light this product was adequate but not impressive on its own i think it would be ideal for those with acne or oily skin but for combination or dry skin it was just okay where it was as a product booster when applied over another moisturizer it did seem to enhance the effect i appreciated that it is not tested on animals and includes ingredients including , ginseng and ceramides the bottle is small but a little goes a long way it is also safe for the eye area overall a nice product to have in your beauty arsenal
5	so pretty
5	nice , expensive for what you get but nice neutral colors and last all day
4	this is a strong moisturizer that leaves a moist film on the skin a large bottle it should last quite a while as it only takes a small amount to give results
4	at 42 , i'm a bit younger than the target market for this product , but i love skincare products and l'occitane , and so eagerly picked this up as part of the vine program i 've been using it now for about a month \( i wanted to give it time to work \) , and am impressed with how lovely this makes my skin when you first open the box it comes in , be sure to check the corner of the box for the small application spatula that is tucked away in a fold of the corner the spatula makes for a more hygienic application since you do n't have to dip your fingers into the jar and risk the possibility of bacteria into the cream \( of course , paula begoun mentions that skin creams and lotions should really be in tubes so that the product ingredients do n't and lose their potency the spatula does n't help avoid that issue , but at least it makes things more sanitary \) because this cream is thick and because i use a lotion with spf during the day , i 've only been using this at night i spread it on over my retin a , and it helps keep my skin supple and moist i do n't think that it has made my fine lines any less noticeable , but it helps alleviate the dryness and peeling that my retin a sometimes leaves in its wake i have sensitive , oily skin , and appreciate that this is also non comodogenic , so it wo n't clog pores or cause pimples it 's a lovely luxury product that makes your skin feel silky smooth !
5	great oil , really tames frizzies conditions
5	amazing body lotion ! my skin is very dry ! i have been using this everyday and i can see a difference ! ! it is a little on the pricey side , but i think it is well worth it !
5	it 's water , in an aerosol can so long as you realize that 's what you 're getting then carry on ! \) i happen to like it but no more or less than evian 's neither of these products do much , in my opinion , to moisturize , firm or tone your skin they are , however , refreshing on a hot summer day and they 're not half bad for setting makeup i also like to use this when traveling by air to refresh my face when i'm feeling a bit oily i just mist heavily , then wipe down with a cotton round and apply a light moisturizer
4	this moisturizer is nice for the days my skin needs just a little more moisture it leaves my skin soft and supple and provides some spf which is an added bonus
4	very pretty spring color , but it 's too much like tropix , another opi shellac color i already have i was hoping it would be a little softer
1	after 5 days i got a rash on my face and i had to stop it 20 is way strong to be used i think you can only use it twice a week the body cream did the same and i had to put cortisone its a good cream but have to be
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	great product that took a little getting used to for me the first time i used it , i worked it through my wet hair and dried it my hair looked dirty and oily when i finished i was using it the way i used mousse , though , including hitting the roots that was the mistake the next time , i used it more as a finishing cream on dry hair , focusing mostly on the ends and staying far away from the roots i could n't believe how well this defined my curls and eliminated frizz , even on a rainy day when my hair would normally frizz up badly
3	almost white in color
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	clean smelling , feels good , came recommended by a gal who uses bioelements in her facials
4	very dense product makes it less expensive than it seems my other gel shaving products have a good of water in them , so on an ounce by ounce comparison , this product is expensive however this is very dense and just a very small amount is needed for a complete shave the scent is subdued due to the , and the small amount needed , you have a neat shave , without a lot of excess water , and the possible mess that goes with typical gels this product provides more shaves , in a neater manner , than typical gels it 's also a nice gift as it has an upper scale appearance i apply the product directly to my face i do not use a brush as others have stated , it it more of a paste than a gel that contributes to the factor
5	great
3	i decided to get this product as an introduction to make up for my 12 year old it is very easy to apply , with just the tap of a button , the make up appears on the brush it flows smoothly and effortlessly onto the cheek and blends in quickly the brush did not stay stiff once the product was on it i decided to try it too , so i could write this review from my own experience as well though it offers a little brightening , i honestly do n't see much of a difference or much shimmer on my face when wearing the skin illuminator i was hoping for more of an impact i do n't wear foundation or blush , as i really do n't like the feel of face make up , so i was hoping this product would give me a little extra without the heaviness i find with traditional blushes , etc the good news is , once applied , i did not feel it at all the bad news is that it is really hard to tell when it has been applied this was true for both my daughter and myself
5	great deal and thank you for wanting to exchange it for me but i ended up keeping it
5	if you like gloss , then this is for you i use it about three times a day , it my lips and it 's shiny but limited color great for summer i really like this product and i have bought in another color
5	i consider myself a beauty guru i have tried so many things to get my skin to look healthy i have very dry and sensitive skin this is the perfect extra pop of moisture or color ! it adds the perfect amount of moisture some products are so matte that it makes your dry skin worse or shows your dry patches this brings that perfect amount of glow to your skin without making it look super oily this does not feel that way if you have oily skin i'm not sure this would be for you i use this every day to set my foundation and sometimes at night if my skin feels tight from my face wash
5	very refreshing product
5	i get so many compliments when i wear this color ! it is the perfect coral that goes with literally any skin tone ! it is especially pretty on tan skin as it pops shellac products always last the longest and are the best quality i do my own gel mani 's at home and it is easy to apply
5	this is an excellent product i have age spots on my face , and i have tried several products to cover them none of the products i have tried previously have been satisfactory i am very happy with the coverage dermablend quick fix body full coverage foundation stick provides i am amazed at how well this product covers and i am happy to not have the spots showing this stick is easy to apply , and i highly recommend it
2	great color but chips very quickly
5	ca n't beat opi polish and ca n't beat the price on amazon ! a winning combination for me
5	obsessed with this stuff been through so many bottles i use it for my face , my hair , as a toner , as a primer , as a makeup setter , as a de i bring the little bottle on the plane on long flights the air is so dry and it saves my life smell is so calming as well
5	i bought this for my sister who loves nail polish it arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color she gets compliments on it all the time , and like other essie polishes , it does n't chip easily
5	boyfriend loved it i love it he smells great ca n't keep my hands off him
5	this is a review of the dermablend loose translucent setting powder in cool beige i am in love with this powder so far ! ! i like the tinted color as a setting powder since it adds even more coverage for my blemishes and sun spots the 1oz size is very generous and i believe will last quite a while the powder comes with a little to apply the product on your face it is really just a super jumbo cotton ball and i'm not sure how it would hold up to being cleaned or to frequent use , but you can easily use another applicator or brush to apply i loved the smoothness of my skin after applying the powder and in extreme dry heat , it has kept me looking matte and fabulous ! overall , very pleased with this product i added a few pics to show packaging and a finished look using the powder as a setting powder
5	i love this stuff this is my favorite of the la roche posay effaclar collection that i 've purchased i love the cream version of the cleanser over the gel version \( which i 've also tried \) it really works and definitely seems to help clear up my skin ! just a little dab goes a long way , so this tube will be lasting me a long time i 'll repurchase when my other cleansers are depleted this stuff is awesome
5	so happy that pca changed the packaging for their acne cream when it was in a little pot , i would think about all the bacteria that the product each time you open it and dip in with a finger q tip whatever my boyfriend uses this as well and much prefers it over other acne spot treatment creams
5	good purchase
4	very high end quality , but at a price only the rich and famous would purchase the scissors are of an extremely safe design with rounded edges rather than pointed the file appears to be quite durable and does a great job of finishing any rough edges the other items might leave the clippers are very sharp and do a great job of trimming even heavier nails the ability for the clippers to fold up flat is quite unique the cover itself is also very high quality thick grade leather very nice expensive set
5	a friend of mine has been trying to find a make up product for over a year apparently , she used this type of product in the past and can no longer find it when i saw the vincent longo olive oil fix tip makeup remover , i immediately ordered it i have used other vincent longo make up \( the lip stain is great \) and also am a fan of olive oil based make up removers so , i thought that even if this product did n't work well for touch ups , i could use if for night time make up removal i was impressed with how well the product worked on all types of make up mistakes , but especially impressed by the way it worked to remove mascara without smudging any other eye make up i have been a q tip and water user in the past with mixed results \( usually removing too much make up \) , but no more this does a much better job and the wands are extremely portable due to their small size the 4 and 1 2 box \( great for travel \) contains a 3 and 1 2 bottle \( 7 \) of liquid make up remover with a wand attached to the cap it also contains 12 extra 3 and 1 2 wands i apply the oil with the attached wand and remove the oil and make up mistake with a dry wand i like this product very much and recommend it to anyone who wants to remover just a small amount of make up without having to re do everything i use it at home , and have also taken it my purse for on the go touch ups my friend is also quite impressed , but sadly , she will have to get her own \)
5	great shampoo that leaves hair clean and shiny
5	i wanted to reorder another color , but it is no longer available , so tried this beautiful rosy red color almost translucent , so color looks very natural almost like you bit your lips and color came up with a shine very moisturizing but wears off easily i ca n't wear many because they dry too much not this one
5	i really like that this concealer is a fairly light formula for a concealer it dabs on without feeling overly heavy , and because it is a more liquid product that some other concealers i 've tried , it does n't tug at your skin when you blend it in a light application will not get cakey looking , and it wears well it does a good job of covering minor imperfections the color that i got is a fairly light shade , not the lightest , but meant for fair skinned people i do n't use concealer every day , but when i do , this one does a great job
4	solid
4	i have a couple of broken vessels near my nose that are more annoying than anything i usually cover them with foundation i 've tried this gel as directed and i have seen a moderate reduction in the redness over time the gel feels like it would be tacky on the face but i have not found this to be the case it dries smoothly for my purposes , i need very little gel so this small container will last me quite a while if you were trying to cover a large area this might get pricey i was n't expecting to see any results so i am pleased with the outcome
5	from the mouth of my in house tester it has a wonderful texture , a pleasant , light fragrance it goes on , stays on , and is not greasy ! i have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with this product or the day cream , nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href vichy aqualia thermal rich cream 1 7 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 vichy aqualia thermal rich cream , 1 7 fl oz a nbsp \( this product is definitely a night cream , which is much heavier \) one very nice touch is in the design of the packaging more specifically , the actual jar the lid is a mirror ! ! ! ! outstanding job by the designer and manufacturer this would make for a very good travel product !
2	i own all the cnd shellac equipment as i believe you get best results when you do n't mix brands , however , when i tried this remover it was n't any better than the normal nail polish remover 's i 've used in the past it 's supposed to be a more pure acetone , but you can just go to the store and find a nail polish remover that is n't too diluted with other chemicals and is half the price it 'll do the exact same , at least it does for me the only reason why i'm not giving a one star only is because i have noticed that cnd shellac colors act differently when you remove them , for instance the red \( wildfire \) is so easy to remove , but the black \( black pool \) is whole different story , so maybe i tried this remover on a hard to take off color
4	i really liked the creamy , non sticky texture of this lip gloss it almost felt like painting my lips with frosting , without the sweetness it does feel very moisturizing and i think it makes my lips feel a little softer , especially in winter when wearing lipstick sometimes makes my lips feel dry the color did n't thrill me out of the tube , i usually prefer something with a little sparkle and this was a pale pink without the slightest hint of shimmer but once applied and rubbed in it gave my lips a flattering natural flush and i do mean rub it in i found it looked best when i applied a small amount \( scrape the brush on the inside of the bottle so you leave at least half the product behind \) and then either rubbed my lips together or patted my finger gently over my lips or used a lip brush to brush out the product if you apply too much it seems to just sit on top of your lips and look unnatural the only real downside is that it does n't last very long i applied it before taking my dogs for an hour walk where i neither drank , ate or really spoke with anyone else and my lips were bare looking when i got home and no , i'm not a lip my other lip glosses lip sticks look pretty much like i just applied them when i get home from my walks so , to get around this issue i apply a pink lip stain underneath the gloss so my lips do n't look bare and washed out when it wears off bottom line , i like the texture but wish it had more staying power and since it 's not just a sweep and go kind of lipstick on me , i usually do n't bother carrying it around in my purse to use when i'm on the go
5	love this color i 've had 3 compliments on how nice it looks
5	this little gem is amazing i have very skimpy lashes and the shape of my eyes always made it so hard to curl with regular eyelash curlers i tried a few different brands but this one is my little miracle my lashes fit right in there with no pinching or missing the lashes perfect !
5	i love this soap and i am looking forward to purchasing the lotion and perfume for daytime wear when i bought this 3 bar set it was 10 00 now its 23 00 early bird ! !
5	as expected , i love this scent , and this brand for hand lotion it works keeps my hands moisturized
5	i love the light lemon scent this product has it 's very clean and refreshing ! i also like that while it appears to be an effective moisturizer it 's also very light i ca n't say if it balanced my skin or not , but i do like it the instructions are to apply 2x daily , morning and evening , but i only use it in the morning
3	i used md forte cream \( a 30 glycolic compound \) for years , then it was discontinued so i had to look for another glycolic and found this one have been using it for a couple months now and it does n't make my skin look as good as the md forte , so will look for another formulation unlike the md forte , it does n't sting when i put it on my skin so is n't strong enough
3	this was my first opi polish so i had high expectations the polish went on nicely but the color is not as shown i expected a nice pink coral color the color is definitely more of a hot pink so far i 've had it on one day with no top coat and no chipping so far
5	the calvin klein endless euphoria eau de parfum is now my girlfriend tammy 's favorite perfume she has been smitten by it i gave it to her as an early 's day gift without telling her i got it from the amazon vine program she thinks the world of it she likes it much better than her chloe eau de toilette spray \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href chloe by for women eau de toilette spray 3 0 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 chloe by for women eau de toilette spray 3 0 oz a \) that i normally buy for her tammy likes to spray the endless euphoria on her wrists and neck she has to be very careful with sprays and oils because her extra sensitive skin breaks out so far , she has n't experienced any allergic reaction with the endless euphoria i like to call it endless love because of the hit movie , endless love , and out of curiosity , i sprayed some of the endless euphoria on my own wrist and loved its heavenly scent however , according to tammy , the scent does n't last more than a few hours this is n't a deal breaker with her because normally , after coming home from work , she takes a shower and sprays more perfume on her it would n't be a deal breaker for me either i normally use obsession for men \( a data hook product link linked class a link normal href calvin klein obsession for men eau de toilette 2 5 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 calvin klein obsession for men eau de toilette , 2 5 fl oz a \) , which , , is also manufactured by calvin klein i always spray some more on me when i want to freshen up before going out for the evening i seriously believe that calvin klein endless euphoria eau de parfum would make an excellent gift for the special woman in your life
4	this concealer goes on easily and lasts all day i use it under my eyes to hid some dark circles that i have inherited it is lightweight and does n't cake fragrance free
5	i use this product on my elbow and knees and i am very happy that this works i'm a little bit scared to use this on my face as i have a very sensitive skin and i ca n't take the chances that 's just me but i'm sure this works just fine
5	i always have a big tube of the shea butter hand cream on my table i 've experimented with the other scents , but i always come back to this one it has a nice clean scent that is noticeable without being over powering and the consistency is nice and thick and creamy , not at all greasy it absorbs well and leaves my hands and cuticles nice and baby soft , even living in a high desert
2	this would have been a 4 star review if the thing did n't stop working after a couple of months \( and i'm noticing this is a pattern with this product , based on the reviews \) at first , it worked great , making thick , luscious curls that made me feel like a romance and then nothing it just stopped heating up and my of being a romance novel cover were alas
5	i struggle with adult acne i recommend all of mario badescu products amazing !
4	i am not great at shaving , so i constantly try new products to see if they help i often prefer shaving cream for men , so i was n't afraid about the fact this was marked as a men 's product i have never used shaving cream from a tube before you squeeze out a small amount , lather it in your hands , and then apply the tube looks small , but there 's enough to last a decent amount of time the lather is nice but not overwhelming , and i got a pretty good shave with it this is pricey for shaving cream , but works well there is a smell \( juniper \) , but it is n't overpowering
5	the curling iron works really well , curls come out really pretty and last all day no issues with over heat and especially like cord seller very good about sending product arrived earlier than expected and packaged very well
2	i usually like vichy skincare products i had expected the same level of quality in their deodorant , but this does n't work for me at all while it is great that it is for sensitive skin , alcohol free , paraben free , aluminum free and salt free , the deodorant feels and damp on the skin at 17 , it is expensive and does n't keep me dry i prefer the dove which has a dry powder feel and works without the need to reapply except on the worst in nyc
5	great price arrived on time works as advertised
4	there 's no doubt that this cream is top notch i 've used inferior brands \( inferior in terms of cost \) such as gillette and barbasol , and gillette was pretty good until i tried proraso perhaps it 's my skin , but when i initially applied it , while still providing a soothing effect , the cream maintained a subtle sharpness it might 've been the combination of the cream and a new badger brush nevertheless , when i shaved i could feel my skin a lot smoother than before it might take some getting used to , but i can already tell the superior quality of this product a bonus is that it 's really easy to clean from the sink after a night 's shave i thought i had cleaned up all of it from the sink , but the next morning i found clumps i did n't see before thinking it was going to give me a hassle to remove as my previous shaving cream had \( barbasol \) , i grabbed some toilet paper and pressed firmly across it i realized i did n't need to push down hard , and it wiped cleanly off with ease i'm sure this product will give me many years of great shaving
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	ok
5	this is a very good quality make up it 's a bronze foundation , so i use it along my cheek line , and it stays on all day i love that it has spf 30 , because i 've been reading up on different kinds of make up , and this is the best for my skin i love the dermablend brand , it 's my new favorite
5	i have used jane iredale for years so i was thrilled to find it at a great price i love this product !
5	xen tan moroccan tan ultra actually does an excellent job of simulating a natural sun tan it mimics my natural sun tanned skin color very closely , great for my tan through the winter months the color lasts a few days before it starts fading significantly , though it does n't streak or leave any splotchy patches like some products do application is very easy and foolproof if you follow the provided instructions one thing to note is that i have mildly sensitive skin and i tend to get a little itchy from the drying effect of most of these sunless tanning products this one has n't caused any noticeable itching or irritation , but as with most things , your mileage may vary
4	i like this shade of lip gloss it 's a very natural looking shade of light pink it has a slight sheen to it which gives lips a moist look , but it does n't look overly sticky or glossy it does , however , feel slightly sticky after you first apply it , but i 've found that most lip glosses have this same feel after a bit of time , it seems like the stickiness fades it has a nice vanilla like scent and goes on smoothly this shade is ideal if you 're looking for a light subtle natural look
5	expensive but really good stuff just the thing for a really good foot massage right after a shower great on elbows , too !
4	this is a nice cream that spreads out over my skin so only a tiny bit is needed it is softening and smoothing but does not make a visible difference in wrinkles my skin feels very soft from the but i ca n't see a difference it has a pleasant mild scent
3	i was intrigued upon receiving this item , as i really have no other frame of reference for products such as this \( other than every other cream on the market \) i , like many others , deal with bags and puffiness in the under eye area so i was really excited that this may be something to help reduce the puffiness honestly , it may have if used for a longer period i have now used this consistently every night for two weeks without seeing any results i am not sure why it is touted as illuminating because it just had a little light at the end of it when i first read this , i had the impression that this may be more of an infrared light therapy somewhat misleading as this is really just a vibrating silicone massager the illuminating aspect should perhaps be taken out of the marketing tag line the other awkward aspect of this item is that it does seem a bit like an adult toy i got several looks from my husband when using it and was once asked if i needed some alone time the whole movement of the thing is just a bit awkward if you can get over the initial of using a a rotating on your eyes this may be more up your alley i , personally , do n't find the movement very comfortable but i do have a rather face so perhaps that is just me ! i will say , the overall packaging and presentation of the item is really well done i felt like i was opening an apple product versus an eye massager ! !
5	wonderful product and quality
5	i love this cleanser it foams so easily and i like how clean it makes my skin feel i feel like it cleans my skin really well without drying it a whole lot it also smells nice and fresh to me the first time i used it i told my how clean my face felt its a great everyday wash
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	i do like this product skin feels soft after using but do n't think i will purchase again not feeling it is making a huge change to continue investing in it
5	dermablend has a great product lineup with some great camouflage blends from heavy to lighter coverage they all feature some amount of spf protection i really like the quality and feel of it it leaves skin feeling smooth and is not greasy nor sticky the texture is silky which is a nice surprise the coverage is excellent and a little goes a long way even applied to hands and neck this works well on most areas it has good water and sweat resistance and stays on well a quick scrub with a good skin cleanser and water washes it off you do have to put some effort into it great foundation and camo professional strength is right i find the stick applicator to be very convenient and easy to travel with
5	this really does last all day ! i got a good 6 hours of wear out of it and the only reason it came off at that point was because i ate a very oily dish i have dry lips and this is one of the few lip products that does n't make them uncomfortably dry i was also able to dab on a bit of lip balm over the lipstick once in awhile to keep my lips hydrated without the color coming off the shade is a deep matte berry brown shade that looks awesome on my fair , cool toned skin i like that it is a darker shade that is n't too loud
5	i use many mario badescu skin care products they are not too harsh , feel great on my skin , and the price point is excellent since i am always in the market for a moisturizer with spf that i can wear under my usual makeup , i was eager to give this one a try first of all , there is no harsh scent the product is n't greasy at all , and it absorbs nicely it did n't feel at all heavy on my face , and it is definitely light enough to wear under makeup though the moisturizer is thick , it does n't have a thick feel to it this is an excellent size bottle , also easy to throw in a cosmetics bag ! try using one of the oils at night , pair with the moisture magnet in the morning , and your skin will feel great
5	love , love this flat iron i have baby fine hair and it has so many setting it does not break my hair best flatiron i have ever had
2	i like wearing neutral color on my nails and i usually love essie i went with this color to get some subtle glitter i was disappointed with the product it goes on with lots of streaks it needs at least 3 coats to get the right coverage and the nice milky pink finish i stay away from 3 coats for nail polish because it does n't last as long the good thing about this color is that it wears well meaning that chipped color does n't show i wore it for almost a week , so that 's good i doubt that i would have been able to do it with 3 coats , but i will experiment it is a good color for the office , but i still wish that it was less watery
3	this is a nice set of 3 colors which would serve many skin tones , with the possible exception of olive or yellow toned skin i have fair skin and found the darkest color to be too dark , but the other two work well for shading or highlighting the cheek area even so , i had to use the middle color sparingly the product is a baked powder , not a cream , and although the package is small and fits easily into a makeup kit the amount of powder in the pans is generous there is no brush or sponge included , but it does have a handy mirror for using this on the go currently at 32 , this is overpriced compared to other contour sets and the quality not better to warrant the higher price 3 stars
5	this is a very promising product ! of course , time will tell , but so far i do love the results ! as soon as the weather starts turning cold and the indoor heat gets turned on at home and at work , my nails start chipping and seem to snag on almost everything i touch i gave myself a manicure and used only this product on my nails it seems to have given them a little more , and the tooth edges have not ! it dries quickly , and i have reapplied it with good results i put a little extra on the edges of my nails and a little under the free edge if you are looking for something to give your nails a light shine and improve their strength , i do n't think you can do any better than londontown i hate on cosmetic items , but sometimes , you really do get what you pay for therefore , recommended !
5	yes , i love it helps to heal skin after breakouts ! never used anything this good before !
5	great color i love this polish it lasts for two weeks with no chipping and the shine stays this is the best polish
5	my favorite hairspray
5	way better than benefit they 're real i received a sample of this in my december 2016 ipsy bag i did not think i was going to like it but it is seriously so nice ! it does not clump at all and provides a perfect amount of length and volume once i run out of the sample size i have i will totally purchase the full size !
3	i'm a big fan of mario badescu products that i 've used the only lotion i 've tried in the past is the summer shine body lotion i love the fragrance and the way it makes my skin look i had hoped that the vitamin e body lotion would smell as good or better the scent reminds me of a cheap sunscreen it 's a light scent , but does n't dissipate very quickly on the positive side it does moisturize really well i would give this 4 or 5 stars if it was n't for the scent i am a little more sensitive to smells , so this product may work better for you
4	after much and a lot of wine , i decided to go ahead and buy i to a lone star and happily put it on my nails when it arrived i was impressed with the color , an opaque light gray with a slight pearl to the finish , but it seems a little weaker than the solid gray that we see in the photos i wore it for about three days before i decided i wanted something a little as far as low key colors go , it 's good for work , play and about anything else survives dishwashing well , but the opacity of the color leaves a little bit to be desired unlike other opi polishes , this is streaky on the first application and okay on the second it requires a full three coats to not be able to see light through the tips of the nails overall , the color is good i like it better than a comparable polish \( i think recycle \) by essie , has no brown undertones , and is good for all skin tones however , it made my long nails look short compared to other polishes where the moon of the nail meets the cuticle , the layers of color were pretty apparent and again seemed weak , and at the tips the polish wore off pretty quickly , even with a good topcoat i think this is why the nails look shorter
4	this stuff is a miracle in a jar it 's a bit heavy for my skin every night but it works wonders when i get dry patches or need my skin to look dewy the next day
5	some people have commented that the polish was watery , not the case with the one i got i bought it as a back up for my pedicure in case i chip i can do a touch up worked just fine
5	my teenage daughters love this perfume the scent is pretty but not overwhelming or cheap smelling and the bottle is really pretty excellent perfume for teens
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
2	this color is so much more lighter than the bottle , and what is written on cnd 's website ! i love the concept , but the color is for a small child , not an adult !
5	very good !
5	because it 's called cleansing soap , i thought this stuff was body wash at first actually , it 's facial cleanser with seaweed extract , which gives it a minty green color it smells pleasant , however , and the texture feels a little like , though it does n't leave you feeling greasy or sticky a little dab goes a long way and after i rinsed it off , i felt clean and refreshed i 've tried other mario badescu products and this did not disappoint
5	hands down this is the best cleanser i 've ever used i'm 32 , have normal skin with an oily t zone and have large , clogged pores on my nose and chin i bought this after seeing use it on one of her beauty videos i have occasional cystic acne on my chin area and none of my normal acne topical 's were working i only use the cleanser \( not the cream or after cleansing toner \) with my clarisonic and oh my ! not only has the acne stopped completely , but the super large clogged pores are pretty much gone too ! i 've struggled with large clogged pores since high school and this has been the only product that has ever reduced the pore size and the clog itself ! even the clarisonic on it 's own did n't have this big of an impact and i 've been using it for 5 years ! i love this cleanser ! i use it only at night time with my clarisonic i prefer to use a cetaphil cleansing wipe or a bit of the water \( with the pink cap \) to cleanse in the morning i use lush serum and lush cream to moisturize works like a dream no breakouts , not overly dry , and my skin looks amazing !
4	juice beauty stem cellular repair eye treatment for the most part works as described it did n't reduce dark circles quite as much as i thought it would but then again that may come with time the regeneration claimed by the product description could possibly take time i ca n't say for sure what i can say for sure is that it definitely reduces lines and wrinkles it definitely reduces eye puffiness the applicator design is brilliant its almost spatula like applicator not only applies the product evenly and keeps your fingers away from your eyes , but the design of the applicator also moves fluid from under your eyes dealing quite effectively with puffiness under the eyes in the morning this is definitely a worthwhile product
5	i read a review about mask recently and decided to give it a try i'm glad i did first of all it smells great , goes on easily and only takes a small amount to cover your whole face i put it on before my shower and before i'm ready to get out i simple wash it off my face feels fresh , smooth and clean !
5	saw this color featured in several magazines , and was happy to see it available here the color is a vibrant glazed deep pinky purple that goes with so many fall and winter colors stunning with grays , jewel tones , and a real pop with black i like essie because it stays on nicely without chipping essie always has the perfect updated colors this color will look great with whatever you wear this winter \( the lace is on \) also bought another 2013 color , vested interest this is a lovely matte color , a greenish gray , that also goes great with tweeds and other fall colors love the slightly edgy vibe , but super wearable , and looks fabulous on short nails
4	i accidentally ordered this in the wrong color , so will pass it on to a friend i did try it out , though , and it provides smooth , blendable coverage that really does cover large marks \( veins , bruises , etc \) really well it also sets nicely , and does n't rub off on clothes
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	i like the cnd products this is a lovely darker shade of taupe follow directions exactly and the polish should last 5 7 days wo n't harm the nail or dry them out as does the shellac and uv light
5	this stuff is magic this paste solved all my hair problems it helps style hair while giving an extra bit of boost it wo n't cover a bald spot but it will keep thinning hair from falling flat it keeps my hair tidy it says mattifying but i have n't noticed that i think you would have to use a lot but then you would be using this wrong this is n't a gel or mouse to get the great results , you have to activate the fiber put a dab on your index finger and tap it with your thumb until fine strands appear then kind of scrunch those fibers into your hair define what ever pieces you want this works as well as salon stuff and was much cheaper
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	terrific sunscreen ! high spf \( 60 , \) water resistant for up to 40 minutes , light texture , good for kids and well adults i especially like that it absorbs quickly and has no fragrance i can use on my face in place of moisturizer , and apply makeup right away and i also do n't smell like a colada not inexpensive , but worth the money
5	very pleasant to use , this 1 6 ounce tube of tinted sunscreen offers 50 spf broad spectrum protection from the suns rays after a appeared on my forehead i became more diligent in selecting skin care products that include sun protection the active ingredient is 16 2 percent zinc oxide which can make creams thick and hard to evenly apply but it is formulated so it blends well a medium beige tint is added but the depth of the pigment is light so rather than add noticeable color just lightly refines skin sunscreens normally must be reapplied depending upon length of time in the sun , so it may be wise to keep the product nearby during the day not waterproof , so perspiration or a dip in the water will reapplying the first inactive ingredient listed is ascorbic acid \( vitamin c \) , then biotin and next green tea the list reveals a number of additional botanicals and other items used to nourish and hydrate skin so this is more than a simple sunscreen designed to be used on face and neck , the squeeze tube has a tiny opening to control product release , and there is a foil inner seal on the tube opening to ensure on arrival it is fresh and untouched the fragrance is mild and herbal , quickly after being applied to skin
5	i was very pleased with this compact , the new year 's eve what a great idea , having blush , 2 shades of lipstick \( darker mauve and lighter slightly pinker shade \) and 6 shades of eyeshadow \( shimmery cream , flesh colored , light brown , pinkish mauve , gray and regular dark gray \) these are all neutral colors that will look good on most people they apply smoothly , no odor that i could detect or anything else to dislike about them \( the one thing is the little brush that comes with it fine for the eyeshadow , except that it does n't fit in the compact ! for the blush and lipsticks , there is n't a separate applicator i put some on with a finger , but it does n't come off easily good for lipstick , not for fingers \) another plus was the compact itself , seals magnetically and is a good size about 2 1 2 square with the same size mirror the mirror , imo , is a real plus i hope this catches on , because it 's a great idea
5	i'm an african american male with thinning hair on the sides as well as top due to over processing my hair as a youth it makes it difficult to get a nice even haircut and i ca n't where the low to bald styles since i have acne keloiditis around the rear hairline which causes hair loss and unattractive keloids it 's so embarrassing that i do n't even like for people to stand behind me on the elevator one day i discovered toppik and although no one in the videos had my type of hair i thought what the hell , it 's worth a try toppik has completely changed my life it 's not perfect but look at it like makeup it covers up just enough so that if you did n't tell people they would n't know i have confided in 2 or 3 close friends that i started using it and asked if they saw any difference they said that stuff is f amazing ! if you have thinning or balding hair , scalp issues to cover up it 's worth the money it 's not gonna stay on overnight it 's not going to stay put on the sides or back under a hat i 've even tried holding spray and it will work but i personally have to gel my hair so hard that it 's not favorable all the time those are the only downsides take it from me and my friends it works and its amazing \)
3	it is a bit challenging to get overly excited about any particular lotion , including one with an of benefits this lotion goes on well , has the minimum recommended spf , and , if you like that sort of thing , a decent odor on the negative side , the cost is quite high relative to lotions that are purely sun blocks the lotion goes on smoothly and easily the odor seems relatively mild when outside where the breeze tends to blow the smell away we can see situations where people with a sensitive nose could find the odor overpowering , particularly when used on large areas of skin the color , which is light , tends to disappear as the lotion is spread on the skin the lotion allegedly has antioxidants and aloe extracts we are unsure how beneficial such are given the application on the skin aloe allegedly has healing benefits , but we suspect that the term antioxidants is thrown about even without a defined or measurable benefit the lotion is supposed to be put on about a half hour before sun exposure we are unsure of the reason for the wait by the time a half hour has passed , the water in the lotion has pretty much evaporated , leaving the sun block and whatever remain , presumably including the antioxidants and aloe extract one downside to this lotion is that it is relatively fragile the lotion comes off in water and a towel rubs it off easily presume that it will need to be reapplied regularly when outside for long periods frankly , while the lotion seems fine and may have the benefits , we just do not value the benefits enough for the price there are many sunscreen or sunblock lotions available at a substantially lower price , including those that are water resistant those other lotions may not have the antioxidants and magic dust of this lotion , but we have to wonder whether the benefits of the magic dust are such that this lotion is worth the asking price we tend to think not good luck !
5	the color is really beautiful , it lasts a lot , doesnt fade i always buy this nail polish and have never had any concerns about it
5	this leaves my hair feeling really soft and silky for several days after use \( and following a few washings \) hair is straight and fine and it might weigh it down a little bit but it 's worth the softness i love this product
3	after using this daily for a few days , my skin got very dry i ended up returning it because my skin stayed irritated for like a week afterwards it may work for others , but i think it was too much for my sensitive skin \)
3	i took off a star for the non sticky advertisement since it is a bit sticky i did n't have quite the same problems as a few of the other reviewers , but it 's important to note for people looking for a non sticky gloss other than that , it 's a pretty good product i like the smell you do n't have to apply too much would i pay twenty dollars for it \? maybe personally , i 'd go for one of the darker shades but if this is the color you want , you may be pleasantly surprised i was
5	very minty !
3	i think i got a dud with this particular palette i have heard so many great things about it and great reviews about how wonderful it is and it just did n't work for me it was not pigmented and a lot of the colors did n't even show up on my light skin the texture of the shadows were also very hard and dry i am thinking of giving this one away or just tossing it such a waste , i know , but i never use it
4	this obagi toner feels fresh on my face right after washing it it appears to give my face a healthier tone while tightening pores and it certainly makes my skin feel better i 've used obagi products before and have always like them this toner is no exception
3	i have been using this for a few weeks now , and to be , i have n't really noticed any illumination going on this is basically a nice feeling moisturizer that makes your skin feel good when you use it with that said , you can find very similar moisturizers that cost much less at any drugstore or mass retailer i do n't recommend spending as much money for a night cream , but i'm not usually one to spend a lot of money on something like this anyway if it 's your jam , go for it
5	i love this product it 's gentle and soothing after chemical peels and other facial procedures i 'd recommend it to anyone going through a post procedure process the delivery service was remarkable
4	i always make it clear that it is nearly impossible to verify benefits for anti aging and various benefits in a short time frame so you have to rely on the list of ingredients as a guide and your own experience with a product but as the list of ingredients lengthens and the print gets smaller and smaller it seems like it could be a full time job keeping up and this packaging does n't make it any easier the print is virtually impossible to read and is so tightly that it looks like a disclaimer then combined with multiple languages on the same panel you 'll need a six million dollar man eye to read it the jar itself is very attractive and is with a product of this price however , i will say that right away i liked this because it was thick on my hands but smoothed on and absorbed very easily by my skin it did n't feel heavy at all and was n't an issue when i went out in the humid summer air it feels good and my face likes the effect now as to its claims the primary claims is that it will help you look better deeper into the day i cant really vouch for that as i have n't noticed any differences later in the day but had n't really been looking for them before using this i notice that it does not contain any retinol which has been proven to reduce wrinkles and is commonly found in anti aging blends so i am a little surprised i do n't see it here overall i am happy with the product and results \( so far \) but will likely go back to a preferred brand that contains retinol a and that i have had success with in the past but that is just a personal preference aside from the packaging and the lack of retinol i do n't have any issues with recommending this as a daily moisturizer
5	this is a nice , gentle skin cleanser with just the right amount of moisturizer for my morning regimen not too heavy , but keeps my skin feeling smooth and supple there is only the slightest scent to it i only notice it when i'm washing , it does n't seem to linger at all !
5	very pretty the color swatch images on amazon are very i would recommend that you go online to see images before deciding which color you 'd want this wo n't give you a lot of color payoff and it is n't supposed to it is supposed to be layered over your eyeshadow you can add shimmer to a matte shadow with this it would also be great to use this to add polish and set a cream eyeshadow
5	wife says really good product smooth in application and stays for about 3 4 hours i do apply it in layers the very first time ensuring that the skin absorbs enough of it i do not have sensitive skin but products that are low quality tend to break out my skin it 's not the case with the dermablend foundation i apply it with a makeup puff , set it with dermablend face powder and spray face mist , which helps it set on my skin beautifully it is indeed pricey , but same in the range of clinique , and bare naturals i 've liked it just as much
5	perfect color
5	coverage is perfect and lasts all day into night ! no break outs ! just what i needed for my combination oily skin !
3	i love the original color i received this color via a sample and then purchased more i like it on the cheeks but not the lips the original color looks more natural this one looks weird !
5	great product
5	great color , when i bought it i thought it was very similar to 'jamaica me crazy' by essie but 'the lace is on' looks very different , it is a pretty purple 'jamaica me crazy' is a bright pink shimmer \( more fuchsia \) great finish and formula this is definitely one of my favorite colors for fall !
5	perfection this is perfect for setting my makeup as well as a refresher throughout the day !
5	very good cleanser ! gentle but thorough have used it for years and will continue to use love it !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	this shampoo is expensive , but i think it will become a daily staple for me , along with the matching conditioner i 've been impressed every day with this shampoo it definitely cleans well , has a nice , light smell , and definitely improves the look of my hair throughout the day it 's quite expensive compared to regular shampoos , but a little bit of this stuff goes a long way it should last a good while outside of the price , this really is the ideal shampoo if you do n't mind treating yourself , this is a good daily shampoo , and will become a staple in my daily life
5	i used this powder over a dermablend blurring mouse and it worked together beautifully all day i had thought the color might be off when i opened it but it went on and looked great i used a brush to apply it but it does come with an applicator sponge in the base of the compact and there is a mirror above in the lid of the compact if you want to carry it with you for a touch up this is a excellent cover powder
5	as a post menopausal lady , i was looking forward to trying this it did not disappoint it really adds new life to my dry skin , without making it feel greasy it has a light fragrance , which is very pleasant , and absorbs quickly i know it 's a day cream , but i use it as an overnight cream and it works just as well
5	easy to use
3	facial misting sprays are nothing new evian has one that has been popular for decades i once heard a remark that evian was backwards , and im thinking about that statement as i write this review i used this mist after cleansing my face in the morning and at night in place of my usual toner it feels refreshing and i enjoyed it while it lasted , which was about 2 1 2 weeks for the 1 69 ounce size the water in this mist is supposed to be infused with all kinds of rare minerals , and while that may very well be true i cant see how misting some onto my skin is going to have any lasting benefit i certainly did n't notice any difference in my skin one way or the other , and this is n't an item id purchase again bottom line feels nice , but seems like a gimmick to me not something id consider a beauty essential , but if you have a generous beauty budget you might like to try it for yourself
5	this is easy to use , glides on and covers blemishes beautifully i was impressed by how it blended with my skin , even as it was covering and blending with a different shade of skin on arms v legs i did n't think it would be so good , but this is definitely not at all like the cheap concealer you can buy in a drugstore really good product
4	this is a really lovely product from l'occitane i am in the process of losing some weight and was wanting to get something to help soften my skin in the process , hoping my skin will have that nice elasticity of younger years and the idea of an almond scent sounded really nice i have been applying this after showering and it goes on smooth , and easily rubs in so you do not feel greasy i noticed that even getting dressed right afterwards , i did not feel like my clothes were sticking to me , so that was a nice surprise and definitely a big plus for this product my only wish is that the scent was a bit lighter but then again , i do have a very sensitive nose and also deal with allergy and sinus problems i am usually fine with natural scents and real essential oils , but some can bother me , hit or miss , usually the heavier ones this skin oil has a pleasant smell almost like a vanilla almond scent but it just seems a little too heavy for what i would personally prefer i wish it was a crisp orange citrus scent , or maybe rose or lavender orange and jasmine is a really nice blend also but even with the scent , i have been using it because i have seen an in my skin my legs and arms especially if they would come out with this product in different scents , i would definitely reorder it all the time i am really impressed with how well it seems to improve my skin 's overall texture and
2	i love essie nail polish , but for some reason this one chips off very easily maybe it 's the shimmer
5	this looks amazing in sunlight it 's not quite a neon but it 's definitely bright and noticeable i love this color because i 've been looking for a bright bubblegum pink , and this is perfect ! the formula is typical essie kinda gloopy and thick but not too bad
5	i'm out and about a lot , and no matter how much i dislike putting it on , it 's inevitable i need to put sunscreen on my face the vichy soleil is quite possibly the best facial sunscreen i 've used to date the sunscreen works very well when i put it on and was out for the afternoon in the warm california sun , i did n't get sunburnt on my cheeks and while i was sweating the sunscreen stayed in place and did n't bleed into my eyes rendering me the sunscreen goes on very smoothly unlike other sunscreens i 've used , this sunscreen is very liquidy , which helps when putting it on your face it goes on evenly , dries quickly , and is matte in texture once dry it also feels very light on the face in fact , i could hardly tell i was wearing sunscreen at all and does n't make my face look greasy at all i did n't have any issues with breakouts , and liked how the sunscreen did n't have an overpowering chemical scent the scent is very subtle , and once on my face i could n't smell it at all i am also able to wear makeup with this sunscreen as a base , and i have n't had issues with the makeup running or smudging overall , this is a really great facial sunscreen i started putting it on daily with good results , and have n't had any issues with burns i would definitely buy this sunscreen once i finish this bottle
5	seems like a great product so far we 'll see
4	this is a nice shade that should look good on anyone at any age i only wish it came with some type of applicator as not everyone has their own brushes
5	and i should stop here because those two words pretty much sum up this duo you will get a tube of body lotion and a 1 6 oz spray parfum the scent is very understated and what my grandma would call agreeable it is difficult to describe the scent its neither fruity nor floral , the best words i can find to express the aroma is clean with a edge of sweet the lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly the spray is dispersed as a fine mist this lacoste packaged set makes a wonderful gift for the special girl in your life , be she your sweet 16 or grandma lovely , lovely fragrance
4	this is a very pretty palette of light , slightly shimmery colors that work well with my fair complexion \( blue eyes , copper hair \) the colors tend to the warmer end , but not by much \( i look better in cool colors , and these still look great \) the shimmer is also very subdued , so i could easily see using this palette for daytime looks despite the glam title that suggests evening looks \( to me , at least \) i find that these shades give me a better than natural look that 's not too dramatic , nor is my makeup the first thing people will notice the colors work individually or blended , and there 's enough pigment that i do n't need heavy application there 's also not an unusual amount of fallout when applied i find it a little odd that the darker colors in this set are lighter than those in the nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href jane iredale eye shadow kit daytime dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 jane iredale eye shadow kit , daytime a , and find that the liner shade is n't very dark , even when applied wet if you 're looking for a set with a dark liner , you might want something else i'm also a little disappointed by the tiny size of the four detail shades i 've bought several other jane iredale products \( lipsticks , lip stains , shadows , blush \) , and was ready for the high price , but this palette seems a little for the price even so i think the like nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href jane iredale purepressed eye shadow triple brown sugar 0 10 oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 jane iredale purepressed eye shadow triple , brown sugar , 0 10 oz a nbsp offer a better value overall , a lovely palette for day or night , with some reservations
5	good
2	you definitely need to add more than 2 coats super sheer and my nail shows through i 'd resell it if i could
5	i use this product because of the retin a i use on my face daily this moisturizer is great for putting it over the retin a or just use it alone a day or two a week your skin feels so soft and it is also very moisturizing this product is a staple in my bathroom
5	have had the clarisonic forever had the first clarisonic and had the mia 2 clarisonic worked great for me \( yet too strong for every day use \) i would end up using once or twice a week at most bought the foreo a little hesitant but i was tired of having to purchase head replacements for clarisonic the mia , not having the stand , would leave me with the feeling of not having all the water removed the foreo would be less expensive , considering i would no longer need to buy head replacements i am using for two weeks \( which i agree is not a lot \) , but it has cleared all my acne , my skin is clearer and my nose pores have become smaller i am in love with it ! just bought the mini for travelling the battery is very good \( i seem to need to charge my clarisonic all the time \) , i have for three weeks and no charging necessary ! ! ! love it ! ! ! !
5	color is shear , but a nice pretty gold
5	nice color , looks great will definitely recommend
5	i use this cnd scrubfresh to prepare my nails , before i polish them with cnd shellac power polish using scrubfresh , creates a great surface on my nail , for the shellac power polish to adhere to i not only clean my nail surface with scrubfresh , i also clean under my nails with scrubfresh , before polishing i wrap a very small piece of cotton around the end of an orange wood stick , and dip it into the scrubfresh i use it to clean beneath my nails then , i clean my nail surfaces with a non cotton pad , saturated in scrubfresh i let the scrubfresh dry on my nails , then begin polishing them with my favorite cnd shellac power polish
5	this polish is the color of coral it 's very versatile depending on if you use other colors on different nails good polish was not goopy

4	very concentrated so you do n't need a lot feels light on the face has a bit of a scent i ca n't quite describe , not necessarily unpleasant but just , might be a bit of a chemical smell but it depends on the person it probably will not be enough to stop you from using it not sure about the whole thing i think that would be a waste of money and this stuff is pretty pricey already because it goes such a long way i guess it would be worth the price as it does feel nice on the skin
1	the glitter is exact and too much so , one looks as if one has sparkly on one 's nails there are better
4	this pomade came right in time as i had just finished cutting my husband 's hair he likes it on the short side and has been using styling gel for years to get his hair to lay like he wants it too at first he was a little hesitant to try the pomade saying it was too thick and it smelled sweet , but after he used some he seemed to be quite satisfied with the look he obtained he said it was nice to be able to leave a few finger comb through his hair the only thing he was n't too fond of was the scent i like it however i 've always loved the smell of pipe tobacco and this pomade smells like a mixture of pipe tobacco and honey it is thick and a tiny bit disconcerting at first because of the thickness , but you do n't need much and it does a good job of keeping hair where you want it and nicely so
5	i love all my vichy products i have the cleanser , moisturizer , serum and now a facial mask they feel and work as high end skincare but the price is reasonable and amazon carries such a wide variety as i get older , my skin turns dry beginning around this time every year and stays dry until may so i'm looking for a good mask application is easy a little bit goes a long way it 's a cooling gel it 's thinner than vaseline but thicker than water at first , i thought that this would be my first disappointment in the vichy line i'm used to slathering on thick creams to get the results i needed i should n't have worried although it seems a bit thin , this gel was moisturizing i used it at night and my dry patches around my crows feet were noticeably less creased this lasted for two days so it 's not a permanent solution hopefully , with continued use it might be longer lasting
4	i like it but very expensive and other comparable products available
3	i did n't have any issues with an orange tone using this lotion however , it was streaky i had high hopes that this self tanner would not streak , but i have yet to find one that does not
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
4	first , i admit i will have a hard time accurately describing the nature of this particular fragrance definitely sweet , definitely complex to me , more fruity than floral another reviewer used the sour grapes and black , and these would be the closest i 'd come to i generally liked it definitely a product you would n't find a teenager getting excited about it lingered a long time , perhaps a bit on the strong side maybe the kind of fragrance you wear the evening after a tennis match or something i'm sure this is what they were aiming for but i'm not sure words are an adequate way to describe a fragrance like this , so definitely try to sample it if you can
5	feels luxurious and seems to moisturize on contact nice and thick , not runny not greasy unusual , but pleasing , kind of herbal scent i also like the packaging it 's user friendly and looks like it will be easy to use to the end
1	it was watered down ! it was a waste of my money
3	it me when a product comes with a medical warning it double me when this warning is not stated in the product description i knew about the sunburn warning going in that one is stated im not a sun and besides , this skin brightener and blending cream arrived in the dead of winter in the so imagine my surprise when i flipped it over and found a very different warning label on it contains sodium , a that may cause allergic type reactions included symptoms and life or less severe in certain susceptible people really , obagi \? ! its not like asthma is a rare condition or anything shame on you for not giving this the it should be given over since im not , i took my chances with the nu derm blend fx for the sake of a fair review fortunately , i was fine , and i do feel like my skin is slightly brighter when i use this cream , slightly being the word do i think its upwards of one hundred bucks brighter \? no way , not even close
5	gorgeous color , goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone very happy
3	i found this eyeliner just okay it was n't horrible , but it was n't great either it 's no better than any you can snag in the drugstore i'm actually more fond of the ulta brand ones than this it worked okay , but it 's nothing amazing or revolutionary i did n't find the color any more intense than other brands , either it 's black , of course , but even so it was not super thick like some are maybe i got a dud eyeliner \? i'm not sure however , there are more inexpensive brands that work just fine
4	this stuff is great and definitely helps clear up zits when used as directed the earlier you detect a pimple forming and put this stuff on it , the more likely it will go away before coming to a head it seems to even help reduce popped zits \( i know i should n't , i just ca n't help it sometimes \) in terms of swelling and redness even cystic acne goes away i also use a thin layer on areas that i feel may break out \( like freshly brows \) and it is great for prevention i docked a star for the frustrating package it comes in if the bottle was a little wider and shorter it would be perfect when you get to the bottom of the bottle , you ca n't really reach it with a regular sized felt tipped swab , for one thing , and for another usually the alcohol will completely dry out before you even get to the stuff so it dries into powder \( i have gone through two bottles already \) the last of the product is wasted unless you add a little of your own alcohol to the bottle and dig a cotton swab in there , covering your fingers in the residue at the top
5	my daughter has cystic acne , but not oily skin , so it is important for her to get products that will help with her acne without stripping her skin this is a nice cleanser the willow bark and chamomile in this formula help soothe the skin
3	this review is a neutral point of view thus far i ca n't say anything bad nor anything extremely good about this product i have applied it to instructions after washing my face and before i add any moisturizer \( i do not wear makeup \) my skin is super sensitive and has not broken out nor reacted badly , but i also do n't see any significant improvement i must add that i do not have sun damaged skin maybe treating such wrinkles with this serum is more noticable \? also , one is supposed to use both the serum and cream for optimal results i only received he serum and therefore ca n't comment on the results when both products are used i will post updates if i notice any significant changes
5	very good color for french manicure not a bright white for like flowers or eyeballs more and natural its is a two coat product and dries very nicely
2	yes , i dare to give oribe conditioner only two stars why \? ok , well , this stuff costs a fortune , and is not all that great i have fine , dry hair , and definitely need a conditioner after every shampoo , but for the cost , this stuff just has n't been worth it after using it for about two months , i switched back to my old conditioner which works far better and is far less expensive i 've used biolage for years now , and it actually works i wo n't buy this conditioner again i can barely tell that my hair has been conditioned after using it , and then my hair is oily within two days blech
5	another great color with depth and good coverage wears well
5	i love this brush it is so soft , yet it still cleans well because the clarisonic device is awesome i'm glad they came out with this sensitive skin version
5	even good for face ! i love in dry california i get eczema on my face and this stops the environment from sucking out my moisture i drink a lot of water too the smell is like cam fore but goes away after 2 minutes
3	instead of applying this by itself , i mix it with a serum on my palms before applying it the serum , and makes both products easier to spread on the skin it does make my skin burn some days , so i would consider this worth using a couple of times a week it does help even skin tone , so i recommend it for occasional use
4	i realize that there is nothing you can really smear on your face that is going to erase wrinkles still , i would like to hope that with better moisturizing , i can lessen the appearance of them anyway this smells very light and really sinks into my skin quickly i like that before this , i used some olay gel type , but it is terrible with using under makeup it sort of lays there and leaves some sort of film that can slough off a little when i apply makeup i will probably still buy that gel stuff because has a cooling feel and i like the way if feels under my eyes this obagi does sink in nicely as for lines , it does help but is no miracle i am not sure if it is better or the same as other creams after a week , i did n't get any real compliments or anything \( even from my mother who always comments if my skin looks good or bad ! \) maybe i have n't given it enough time i will lay off the other kind and use this only for the next few weeks if anything changes \( bad or good \) i will update my review for now it gets a b
1	all hype no substance and at an outrageous price tag the dr brandt at home solution for wrinkle relaxing did zero to any line on my face im one of those lucky people who has very little facial creasing at my ripe old age i occasionally get the bug to try to eliminate those that i do have and have found some products that fill a tiny bit unfortunately dr brandt needles no more is not one of them on the plus side the solution has a pleasant aroma and the texture feels soothing much like nivea cream the big minus is that i personally think that any product that implies that it will work like botox is setting itself up to disappoint its customers thumbs down from me
3	i tend to be in between the shades of light and medium usually , so i opted to try the darker of the 2 shades , as my last mineral foundation that i bought was on the pale side and everyone noticed \( not in a good way ! \) and commented that my face looked as i definitely was n't going for the look this time , as i am new to this brand , i figured if i had to i was going to go darker than lighter darn , darn , darn ! although this medium shade compact was not as dark as it appears in the picture because after you mix it up it is about 1 2 that shade as the other powder it whitish however for my skintone it did n't look good as i have a lot of yellow in it and this did not self correct and blend in like some other foundations i have used did when i put it on very lightly it is not so noticeable but then i do n't get any coverage for my freckles and blotchy patches in i should have tried the lighter shade , at least by the pictures here on amazon it appears to have a bit more yellow warmer tones in it and it may have been just the one that would have been right for me hope this review helps someone else choose their correct shade wish i got the lighter warmer toned one ! as for the application grinding mixing aspect this was more messy than my bare minerals foundation as the mixing procedure with my brush caused much more to spill out the sides than when i normally load my brush with the bare minerals foundation but that would n't deter me from using this if i had the right shade for my skin it has no noticeable scent and i had no irritation from using it and i have very sensitive skin !
1	after i used the oil i expected this to work wonders but it made my hair crazy frizzy and i felt i wasted my money
4	instant tan for last minute but smells musty to me color is very dark
5	the vichy aqualia thermal facial essence water works very well as a supplement to my usual facial moisturizer apparently designed to add an extra layer of hydration to skin , i did find that this water was effective at keeping my usually dry patches on my face moisturized i have combination normal dry skin , and often when i use moisturizers , my normal patches get a bit greasy feeling while my dry patches show no significant change \( aka , my skin is still dry and flaky \) after using the essence water for a few weeks now , i 've noticed that my entire face is well moisturized without being oily in some patches and flaky on others it 's really helped my facial routine , and the results are overall positive the essence water has a consistency of water , so it would be to either use a cotton pad to apply , or to put this into a spray bottle why vichy did n't put it into a spray bottle to begin with is a bit confusing to me since using one really makes application much easier the essence water has a light floral scent to it which vanishes quite quickly i used it with my normal moisturizer and found that the scents paired well and did n't conflict with each other i did try using this water by itself , but it was n't moisturizing enough for my skin , so keep in mind that this works best as a supplement i would likely buy this essence water in the future simply because seems to work , and gives my skin that extra little boost it needs overall , it was the missing piece i 've been looking for in my skincare routine it 's a simple , but good light moisturizer
5	although it is n't made anymore , there used to be a clarins product that i just loved it was a powder that i would call an eraser for my face little imperfections would disappear this formulation from dermablend appears to be pretty similar to my old favorite swipe it on and it covers mild freckles and discolorations , although darker beauty marks will still be showing through it i 've used it both alone and as a setting powder , and it 's fine with either one
5	i love essie nail polish it 's the best out their and the prices here are fantastic ! very happy with this purchase !
5	i love how compact this is the last one i had was big and bulky and because it was so big i had a little trouble figuring out where i had left off this is more like the older razors and much easier to use you do have to do it more than once to get good results though i like the little travel trimmer since i miss a hair here and there if you have bushy eyebrows , this really helps i do n't know any hair removal kit that does the job in just one time and so it is good to set up a schedule do n't use this every day get on a schedule instead you 'll see results pretty quick
5	buying cologne for myself , i might not have chosen this it smells fine but then , so do a hundred other perfumes for men \( you can call them what you like , that 's what it comes down to \) main thing is , my wife loves this scent on me and let 's face it , guys , those of us who are married , what counts is that our significant other is attracted to our fragrance so for me , that 's the perfect choice something she loves to smell on me \( so long as i enjoy it too \) be aware though burberry makes a number of scents and products this is the one my wife likes a couple others , not so much and the size is good it 's the big 100 ml bottle , so a better deal said \?
5	this is actually my first time purchasing an essie polish and i could n't be happier with it ! great , non streaky formula , applies evenly and gives your natural nails a perfect , even base color great for a basic french mani or layered under more bold colors to help them pop the finish was nice and shiny even without a topcoat and i got about 8 days out of it with minor tip wear definitely a perfect sheer pink will absolutely be purchasing more polishes from essie in the very near future !
3	my wife has been using the standard rotating facial brush for years thus we were hopeful when getting our hands on this option different colors and patterns to choose from not that it really matters since nobody but the owner will ever see this device instructions for battery charging are very specific and makes one think they are using really old technology for this battery instructions include things like 1 must charge at least before first use 2 do n't leave plugged in 3 when it 's time to charge again , charge for 8 to 12 hrs hours , it says ! 4 after for you may get of use before having to charge again interestingly , this uses a magnet on the end of your usb cable to connect to device and charge usb charging provided , but most bathrooms do not have usb for charging it would have been nice to have been provided an ac adapter especially for the cost if you want to use the stand when not in use , you can place the handle down into the stand and charge at the same time the usb cable feeds through the bottom and hangs loose when not charging two red leds that are supposed to to you lots of different things for example , wife wishes the leds would turn green when device is fully charged , but it only has red my wife prefers to keep this on high speed for every use she does n't find a use to slow it down for any reason she 's just glad it has the high speed setting my wife really , really likes the way it cleans and how it makes her skin feel afterward there are beeps to let you know when to a different zone on your face my wife these and just works it all around for a couple of minutes this works fine for her , though i can see how some would like the sound indicator to move to a new zone i found 3 or 4 sonic pulsing brush competitor products , with positive reviews , in the 35 to 40 price range not liking that this is twice the cost and the other products sometimes give extra brushes this does not give you anything extra replacement brushes average 25 and they recommend you change that every six months hmmm probably not going to happen but once every couple of years depending how the brushes hold out overall battery and price are questionable otherwise , my wife is glad she switched from rotating brush to this pulsing , sonic brush
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
1	i'm 30 years old this should have worked wonders for my soft lines i was willing to ignore the list of ingredients \( terrible ! \) if it would erase my fine lines for a wedding i was attending the cooling felt nice for like a second and that 's about it i did n't see any appearance difference and lets not even talk about long term use i used it all up and nope , nothing my suggestion do n't waste your money if you want to know what has worked wonders and you wo n't even believe it bone google it probably better than any product
5	this is a fabulous product it goes on smoothly and it dries perfectly under a uv light that is at least 36 watts however , be careful because i made the mistake of trying to dry it under an 18 watt light , and while it dried , it starting splitting like regular nail polish a few days later when i saw that , i was about to write it off until i saw an ad for the uv light i own it said that it would not dry cnd shellac because it was not powerful enough after doing my own research , i discovered such was the case , so i bought a lamp that was over 36 watts lo and behold , it dries and stays perfectly ! the color is also beautiful , but you will need 2 3 coats to get it to stay on , and i recommend a , and base prior to applying it then , finish it off with the cnd topcoat the cnd base is in short supply right now , but the gelish one works just as well
5	i cannot mario badescu products more highly i have extremely sensitive , fair , oily skin prone to redness and pore clogging around the nose most exfoliating scrubs are harsh and they just the delicate balance of my face not this the scrubbing is so light yet effective i use it after removing my makeup and washing with the enzyme gel or the botanical gel cleanser followed up with toner and moisturizer , this stuff is incredible its gentle enough to use daily my skin has never looked better or been clearer
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	good moisturizer and works well as suncreen good , small packaging
4	i'm mostly a skincare girl rather than a makeup girl however , i was not blessed with curled lashes and need mascara to hold my lashes up i have sensitive eyes and have tried almost every mascara on the market from drugstore brands to professional theatre brands so far , this mascara does not clump , the texture is smooth and it really up my thin lashes the formula dries quickly enough to hold the curl in my lashes so far there has not been any noticeable flaking , but this tube is brand new i will report back in a week and then another week after to see how the formula dries in the tube and when it starts getting dried and flaky so far this is a very nice mascara
5	i originally came across this product while living in canada and was so excited when i discovered it here on amazon i have very dry skin and this is a great cream not heavy at all , a very light fragrance that i enjoy and it is great as a foundation primer
5	i was a little worried that the medium color would be too dark but it suits my skin coloring just perfectly to use this product you flip open the case and then turn the dial which off a combination of the makeup which you then apply with a brush what i like about this product is that although it goes on as a powder it does n't leave my skin looking like it 's been dusted with powder the product provides a good amount of lightweight coverage that does n't leave my skin with that product heavy look or that weighed down feel that you sometimes get with a cream foundation i found it to be a little messy though if you twist the dial too much and grind up too much of the product at once , so start with a slight twist on the dial first so you do n't grind up too much at once i really like this product and it will definitely become a permanent addition to my makeup bag
3	wife says this is a good product but it is just a tad darker than she prefers however , she will keep this on hand to her over to use when she runs out of a lighter color and has not had a chance to renew the lighter color
4	this feels great a mini massage as you clean exfoliate your face i just wish it had a charging base instead of a cable , as i do n't like having loose electric around my sink
5	absolutely love the quality of this product this brand for nail polish is fantastic and the color is delightful speedy delivery as well very happy customer
5	amazing spray , smells just like the soap
5	if ever a brush fit nicely in your hand , it 's this one and what makeup has n't had delightful of exotic kabuki painted faces \? i certainly that with this brush no matter how old we get , every makeup junkie loves to play , using a face as a canvas and we all have an area we wish were a bit different , or one we like and want to play up i have a big eastern european nose \( thanks , dad ! \) that i slim down with contour this brush picks up powders beautifully , and is the perfect size
5	very very light fragrance , barely detectable i believe this type of water is somehow injected with a touch of oil so it does a super job of removing makeup and cleansing pores very gently my skin feels soft and clean after usage i use with a warm washcloth i really like this product
4	pretty color , but not as opaque as i 'd hoped even with 3 coats , the white of my nails is visible
5	anytime ive worn pink sugar compliments in men women \( especially men \) love the scent one or two sprays is all you need its concentrated i get this undertone of cotton candy caramel its fabulous for the fall winter super sexy i bought it when it first launched in my 20s and continue wearing it at 36 ! its an adult gourmand type perfume
4	i 've used this with awesome results gotta be consistent i have it 4 stars cause i think with any nail polish n a little care , your nails will grow but oddly this is always my go to when i'm desperate lol
5	my lady friend swears by this product as a senior citizen , even i as an old guy can use it on my old age scars
5	i have heard of obagi products for a couple of years now , and how wonderful they are this was the first time i 'd used this obagi nu derm clear fx cream so far , i 've been using it for a month and have been pleased with the product i appreciate the clear warning recommendation to be sure to wear sunscreen , as this product adds to the sunburn risk i already apply sunscreen daily to my face and neck , so did n't have to adjust my beauty routine my face is loving this skin brightening cream and the claim that it enhances the appearance of one 's skin so far my skin feels brightened !
5	it 's hard to measure how well a product like this works , unless you only use it on half your face \( which i did not do \) however , i feel a tingling sensation when i apply it to my skin , which gives me the feeling it is working also , it does seem like my skin around my eyes \( which tends to show age the most \) is a little more smooth since i 've starting using this product a few weeks ago i also use other skin care products and a regime , so i cannot say 100 it 's a result of this product , or it is n't something my mind wants to see , so does i really like that there is a little pump that seems to dispense just the right amount i see from previous reviews it used to just be a squeeze tube that tended to burst , so i am glad i got one of these improved packages i 'll update if i see any more results , but for now , it seems to be working well
5	i keep planning to move this to the bathroom for an after shower body cream , but so far it has n't made it out of my home office , where i use it as a hand cream because i enjoy the fragrance so much \( the fragrance is very strong , so beware if you 're not a fan of indian rose \) it has kind of an odd , slick feeling initially , but it absorbs completely and leaves my hands soft and silky , not as if they 're coated with something a small amount goes a long way , and it really does make me pause and just enjoy the moment the jar also looks attractive on my desk
5	love it , fast ship trust which is very great business relationship with customers buyers need to trust them and buy it because i have great positive feel with them
3	i use chapstick on a daily basis and figured i would buy this since i recently bought several other products from baxter it feels nice on my lips , but it does not seem to last any longer than the 1 chapstick i have bought at family dollar in the past for 8 times the price , i figured it would be miracle lip balm , but i was wrong probably would not buy again just because of the price
5	great ! i no longer have to go to the nail salon thanks !
4	the color turned out to be a little too tan for my skin , but the consistency of the product is smooth and easy to blend it does not , however , include an spf to protect my skin , so i will stick to this company 's bb blur , which contains spf 20
5	i actually came across this sort of accidentally see , i was removing some dark red nail polish from my fingernails , and it left behind this really awesome pinkish hue no , i did not use a base coat , and yes , i do realize the pinkish hue was a stain but this got me thinking i would pay for this look i had no idea if i could replicate it , and it was a little uneven so i thought , would n't it be great if there was a nail polish that could give me the same effect \? ! turns out , there is it 's essie 's pink glove service i ordered it a couple days ago , received it today , and put it on my nails are adorable they look so natural and feminine ! i would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic , elegant look for their natural nails \)
5	this has to be the best shaving cream on the market ! i can not use anything else to shave my skin with anymore i am totally spoiled ! it prepares the skin after leaving it on for at least 30 before shaving it makes the shave very close , doesnt clog the razor , and i do n't get razor burn i highly , highly recommend this shave cream to everyone ! just try it , your skin doesnt feel dried out or itchy after shaving either , which i used to hate shaving because i suffered chronically from that
5	reading the experiences of other reviewers on amazon is almost always helpful so when i applied this product , i used a mitt and rubbed it in well i also applied very little cream at a time , so i got a thin , smooth layer that did not sit on top of my skin the tint in the self tanner was helpful for getting an even application i applied so little that it was dry in fifteen minutes you also need to know that i have naturally dry skin that just drinks up creams and lotions i also do a weekly glycolic acid peel in hopes of removing skin discolorations and stimulating collagen , so this tanner does n't ever go onto skin my results were great the process did not take a long time \( again , that dry , thirsty skin \) there was no streaking at all , which is new to me and i love the scent i have not been able to tolerate the smell of other self tanners except xen tan products the tanning chemical , , which is in every self tanner i 've ever used , has always produced an overwhelmingly smell on my skin , but not xen tan products , even though they also contain it on my blue white skin , this moroccan tan ultra produced a wonderful tan color it seemed to me that the color was just a bit warmer and richer than the tan i got from a different xen tan product \( the dark lotion absolute luxe \) a few weeks ago so i later applied them side by side on a hidden part of my body and found this is true i prefer the moroccan tan ultra color but that may be because i have no natural warmth to my skin tone without a tan and i never allow my skin to tan in the sun any more i consistently use sunscreen every day because i'm outdoors for hours every day if you already have a warm skin color , you may prefer the dark lotion absolute luxe , but in either case it 's interesting that xen tan has developed the technology to create different tones , neither of which run toward the orange of older faux tanners i highly recommend this product but for myself will use it sparingly given the expense the 8 ounce tube goes a long way and it needs to at this price !
5	this is an amazing little gadget ! i have similar products advertised and in stores and was very interested in checking it out , so when i was offered an opportunity to review one for amazon vine at no cost , i jumped ! i am on my feet all day at work and living in florida , spend a lot of my free time barefoot these are 2 very good reasons i wanted \( and needed \) this well , i was not disappointed ! i want to say i was simply amazed at how fast it worked i saw instant results now , my were not really all that bad , but i did have some rough patches and very dry , cracked heels guess what \? i do not anymore ! this comes with 2 heads one for really rough , coarse skin \( blue \) and another for softening and polishing \( purple \) i used the blue first all over my heels and on the pads of my feet wow i just ca n't say enough how fast this works i do recommend 2 things first , i would place down a towel or cloth to catch all the dry skin that will flake off it 's a bit messy second , i would suggest using a foot cream one specifically for feet , not a regular hand or body lotion and use it right after it will help with the softening do not worry that this is something that will cause or any real discomfort with use i know some of the advertised foot products look like they might be painful or make your feet sore after not the silk'n it barely felt like i was doing anything and my feet were super soft and smooth after now i am ready for summer and flip without worrying about my feet looking old and dry along with the 2 heads , it also comes with the 2 aa batteries needed and a cleaning brush i do wish it came with a storage case , but i am using an old makeup case i have
5	i must say , i have very fine hair and i 've read reviews that this blow dryer is not good for fine hair despite all of that i purchased it and ive never been happier ! this is a great blow dryer it drys my hair so quickly and my hair has never been smoother ! it is a bit heavy but nothing crazy ! i recommend this product 100 you will not be sorry !
5	love this neon summer collection , and the name says a lot peachy and light , perfect !
2	typically , cnd is known for high quality and this polish did not come close to meeting my expectations the color is not pretty whatsoever , so i have to use an additive or another polish over the top to transform the color plus , a week into my manicure , and the tips of my nails are all faded and the polish is wearing away i do not have this problem with other brands of gel polish , which are much cheaper priced than cnd ! i should have returned this
5	exactly what i expected
4	i am using my husband 's account i like this face wash but i personally think the price is to high it has a pleasant smell kind of smell 's like lemon if the price was cheaper i would buy again but not for the price i would recommend if it was cheaper but i would n't buy it again i just ca n't tell it is any better than some cheaper one 's i have
5	this is some great high end sunscreen totally non greasy and very effective at blocking out the sun used it all day at the park yesterday and was totally clear of any burn what 's really nice about vichy capital is that it applies and feels more like a skin lotion then your regular sunscreen it also has no real scent and my skin felt soft and moisterized while wearing it had a chance to use it in a water situation yet but otherwise highly recommended
5	this color is really cute ! cute coral with shimmer on it originally was for me but my mother ended up taking it for herself
5	we use this nourishing cleansing body gel when bathing our toddlers and it cleans them really well my oldest also commented on how he liked the smell and wanted to use it i followed the instructions and rubbed the gel together with my hands and then on to my 's skin it went on and washed off easily i also enjoyed the smell it was n't too strong but smelled clean it seems to be helping with my children 's dry skin , which is another win we are fans of this product !
5	love this facial spray ! great for sensitive skin
5	this product provides wonderful texture to any hair type easiest way to achieve beachy waves smells divine
5	great collagen mask it 's soothing , firming and helps clear blemishes love it !
5	most expensive shampoo i have ever bought i never in all my days thought i would spend this much money on shampoo i mean after all , how long do you keep the product in your hair \? well , i got introduced to this product through my daughter who just from beauty college and she found out about this product not in her beauty school , \( she had to use the products of her beauty school \) but when she went to a high end hair salon and they used this product on her hair and she absolutely loved the way it made her hair feel so she told me about it and it is now the only shampoo i will use from now on and what is great about the product is i only have to use a dime size of the shampoo to do the job whereas with the other shampoos i have used on my down to my bra length hair i had to use a quarter or more size of shampoo it is costly , but well worth it
4	years ago i used the complete line of obagi products through a physician 's office and loved the results however , the system is intense if you use the prescription products your skin is likely to peel , get red etc to reveal the smooth skin underneath eventually , i had a reaction to one of the products and discontinued the regime the nu derm blend is the over the counter version of obagi 's prescription skin product the rx version contains 4 hydroquinone hydroquinone is an aggressive treatment for sun damaged , pigmented skin but it may also damage skin tissue and is banned in some countries so using the less aggressive fx product will take longer but may be best in the long run the fx product contains arbutin , exfoliants and antioxidants to help smooth the skin and reduce the appearance of dark spots , age spots , freckles and other hyper combined with a retinol product such as an over the counter 1 retinol or prescription strength it can be even more effective at the skin i found the product to go on smoothly it does have a chemical smell to it that is not the greatest it will take time to see how effective it is at brightening my skin but i like the rest of the products in the line and feel this is likely to be another winner i plan to combine it with an otc 1 retinol product
5	great for dry skin works really well and smells great
5	best hand and massage lotion out there it never beads up , as some lotions tend to do it absorbs instantly , with no greasy feel i 've used this brand for years ! luscious scents too i will continue to order opi lotion ! never stop carrying it amazon , or i 'll be ! lol !
4	this spray applicator was a great addition to the use of my fibers i would much rather spray it on than shake it on i can manage it either way i can spray it exactly where i want it
5	fabulous skin line i received my first products from my sisters , they would bring them back from france they were only available in france and canada then my dermatologist started stocking la roche posay i have been using these products for the last 12 years just as good as la mer and lazlo
4	it 's a classic scent , fresh and floral the note that i get most is of spicy it 's on the light side and is not cloying or overly sweet my wife loves it the only complaint is that it does n't last long enough on her skin
5	my wife says it works well neck seems a smoother really do n't need much at all to rub in been using for a couple of weeks and seems quite promising no redness or other ill effects from the use of the cream unlikely to be a miracle cream but does seem to help a bit and every bit counts
5	my hair needs product there 's no getting around it my locks are a hairy 's nest in the morning , and needs washing , brushing , cursing , , and the right product to look even halfway decent in the morning or else it just needs this this stuff was just perfect for my hair it held it in place while still being and touchable friends commented on how my hair looked it washed out nicely and did n't leave flakes of gunk on my brush and comb this was perfect for everyday use , for the office , for meetings with vendors and , and even the occasional night out good casual product for the stylish gentleman
5	love , love , love all jane iredale products read all my reviews
5	it is useful as it described
3	not worth the money just like any other bar soap i 've used also the smell reminded me of a laundry soap used back in my home country it cleans well but it is not worth the money at all dial soap is actually better for my skin
1	i am always looking for alternative healthier sunscreens the ingredients in the sunscreen are not too bad except for the perfume this made my skin dry , red and itchy so this is definitely not for sensitive skin the perfume in here is horrible it started to give me a headache on top of the itchy skin it also leaves white on your face if you put it on too thick it looks like you have diaper cream on your face
5	what a beautiful foundation ! it 's lovely very natural on the skin it 's important to use a brush with foundation like this in order to get even coverage \( a stipple brush would be best \) , otherwise it can look streaky when applied with fingers less product is needed this way and it will last longer than liquid foundation my skin is a bit dry this time of year so i did a good exfoliation and moisturized my face and neck before application i also love how it looks with a primer applied \( i use miracle blur \) when i'm going out it looks smooth and is virtually undetectable , somewhere between light and medium coverage , yet is build able if needed 05 is perfect for my skin tone a paler medium color complexion with a slight yellow undertone there is a fragrance , but it seems to dissipate immediately upon applying to the skin the scent reminds me of ylang ylang , it 's a bit sweet smelling rather than floral i'm glad that the scent fades quickly since i do n't care for fragrance in my foundation this mousse style foundation gives a pretty airbrushed matte look and has the feeling of a high priced \( department store \) foundation this foundation would be ideal for normal to oily combination skin , may be a bit too dry for dehydrated skin unless compensated with a very good moisturizer and or exfoliation highly recommended !
5	this is a great pomade , especially if you style your hair using your fingers and not a comb or brush it 's very thick , my husband only has to use about a nickle size amount on his hair it holds the style all day long but it does n't make your hair hard very nice product and definitely recommended
1	i do not like this perfume at all to me , it smells like something an old woman would wear does n't surprise me since there are none of the typical young notes in here at all \( especially vanilla \) or if there are , i sure as heck ca n't smell them ! all the friends i 've asked have agreed with me that this is an old woman smelling perfume i sold mine on ebay
5	fast delivery , great price !
5	loving this new color and brand soft and not matted and without white tone that i do n't like lasts for about a week before chipping , normal time line
5	i 've been using this since around 2002 and could n't go a day without it it gives me a sense of confidence !
5	got a lot of compliments polish is naturally chip resistant good brand of polish , opi is my other fav , this is the first time i tried essie now i am open to essie as well as opi \( tip learned from my manicurist that the essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is not the real essie beware \)
5	i have a mia 2 and am a big fan of the clarisonic device and heads ! i have a couple different heads and i find that this one is a bit rougher than some of my others , i guess that is to get the pores \? but regardless it works very well i have so i find this is not for me to use every day but i switch it with my other ones and that works for me !
3	first , the good this product is non irritating and is pleasant to apply it has a pleasant smell , and i love the way a small dab smooths out the eyed , just got out of bed between my brows however , aside from spot treating between my eyes , i ca n't quite figure out a practical use for this elixir it 's too oily to wear all over , under my make up because i have oily skin to begin with , even a drop or two of this product causes my make up to slide off into , within an hour of application and i ca n't use it before bed it 's so oily that it ruins my pillowcase \( side , ca n't help it \) and even if i could iron that problem out , i still would n't wear it all over unfortunately , for me , it tends to promote breakouts \( adult acne wrinkles and blemishes what a curse ! \) sigh i was hoping this would be just the thing for my skin , but it 's not if you have oily or combination skin , stay away this is a great product for clear , dry complexions
5	this is a really beautiful color this is my favorite brand of polish ! love this one and they are always coming out with new ones !
5	i think l'occitane is the best when it comes to their rich moisturizers they have such a huge variety in all kinds of scents and skincare needs this moisturizer is rich in scent and texture and i know that you 'll love it it goes on smooth on your skin with its creamy , silky in my opinion it would be a great addition to anyone 's beauty regime and is great for all skin types your skin will thank you it will not only be soft but also hydrated and we need that in the winter
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	not as shimmery as the image shows , its definitely like a dark gray , the image looks more of a 'silvery' look , but still a really great color i love it
4	this is a pretty muted purple pink with an iridescent purple running through it it has great dimension and the wear time is exceptional however you will need at least 3 coats for it to be opaque
5	these are fantastic wipes for bird bathes for baby we use these when we do n't have time or ability to give the baby a full bath they are lightly scented and leave the skin feeling soft and refreshed they are not too wet and usually two wipes will do an entire baby \( results may vary depending on size of baby \) they have not caused any skin irritation on our baby if you hold the wipe in your hand for a few seconds before use , it will be warm enough that it is n't as refreshing to the baby
3	i love jack black products and wanted to try the shampoo conditioner it does have the typical jack black smell to it , but i did not find that it was better than any other men 's products out there paul mitchell , crew
5	very nice color !
3	this left a very greasy feeling on my lips as well as my hand when i it felt very oily and water based and it did not last very long when it was on your lips after you applied the product it does have a nice smell and taste to it the small bottle that it was in was very nice and too so so lip product
4	i love this foundation easy to apply , and blend in , i usually go with lighter than nude because i am very fair skinned but the nude was just perfect without leaving that line of girl you need to blend that in its matte enough that if you wanted to skip the powder you can ! spf 15 and vitamins all in there are also pluses
3	the uslu airlines lipstick goes on smooth and does n't feel heavy or waxy , but it does n't have a strong lasting power either i was thinking that for a lipstick with this price point it would be a one and done application but that 's not the case the color is exactly as you see on your computer screen which makes buying their different shades something you can do with confidence !
5	this is one of the best sunscreen face creams i have ever tried its spf 40 rating is perfect protection for long sun without skin damage it is also a great moisturizer
5	over the years i have tried a few of the toleriane products and have always had good experiences with them and the brand in general when i recently experienced a reaction to a facial cleanser , resulting in an itchy red area around a relatively new surgery scar on my throat , i did n't want to experiment and immediately turned to tried and true toleriane i bought the new ultra because it promised immediate relief and also because i appreciated the hygienic dispenser bottle once again toleriane did not disappoint the creme went on smoothly and literally on contact relieved the persistent itchy sensation that had plagued me for days the calming effect lasted the entire day and the redness also disappeared i was impressed moreover , toleriane ultra provided excellent moisturization , leaving my rather dry cheeks soft and supple its consistency is definitely on the rich side and i would recommend this product more so for dry skin and not for oily or combo skin but if you have dry , sensitive skin this product is a great solution 100 recommend
3	i thought after trying jack black 's phenomenal shave cream , that i would love this product , but unfortunately i do n't the consistency of the cleaner is pretty runny which is a bit problematic with the packaging since the cleanser leaks out of the bottom underneath the cap it seems to do an ok job cleansing and does n't have much a scent , but i think i 'll keep looking for other options
5	love this face system and buying on line makes it affordable
5	i thought it looked great with my blue eyes and light lashes the brown was the right choice for me easy to apply and remove
5	i love the feel of this cream it lasts a long time and i think my neck looks a little firmer at my age , i'm not expecting a miracle ! i think this is a quality product and i would order it again
5	this color is amazing ! it is a beautiful shimmery pink with a lean on the lavender tones i just love it !
5	i 've experimented with several glycolic creams in recent months on my middle age skin , but this one seems to have all the positive results without any irritation even with a 20 glycolic acid content there 's was a noticeable difference from the very first application my skin felt and looked more supple , firm and hydrated with an even coloring after a few weeks of use , i also noticed several sun spots on my forehead are also lightening and are almost i use it only at night , avoid the thin skin under the eyes , and apply oil on my face as well , like tamanu or emu extremely happy and enthusiastic ! everyone 's skin and sensitivity are unique , but for me this is the best product i 've found and will without question reorder it after i 've used up this first jar !
4	laroche posay is a brand i love for skincare , and was excited to find out they have cosmetics ! i have very sensitive eyes , with mascara being the worst through trial and error , i can usually find a non waterproof mascara to use , but finding a waterproof one that i can tolerate is like finding the holy grail and every time i do find one , it is discontinued ! i'm currently using nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href aqua force waterproof defining mascara black dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 aqua force waterproof defining mascara , black a nbsp but i hate it it does nothing for my lashes , but it 's better than nothing if it 's raining out or i know i might cry i first tried this laroche posay before i took a shower i did n't bother to curl my lashes holy cow ! it went on like a dream , and the more i applied , the bigger and more dramatic my lashes got it even curled them \( although not as dramatically as an eyelash curler \) and they were smooth and silky looking , not clumpy or with bits hanging here and there i then took a shower , making sure the water got right in my face i was so shocked to see that my lashes looked exactly the same afterwards ! other waterproof mascaras i 've tried did n't run when wet , but my lashes would , look and chunky this mascara left them perfect i did have a hard time removing it , however i can only use non oily removers due to my acne prone skin , so i'm sure that 's why but i had to bring out the big and do a lot of scrubbing i tried the mascara for real the next day i experienced a slight irritation \( burning \) in my eyeballs after a number of hours sometimes when that happens , if i use a product a few more times , the burning stops it does n't really make sense to me , but that 's what occurs , and did in this case i now have an amazing waterproof mascara ! i would use it exclusively if it was easier to get off with my normal removers
5	my wife and i love this stuff our skin drinks this stuff up like milk goes on easy and disappears quickly our skin feels silky smooth after shower and using this formula smells clean and is not greasy love this stuff
3	i did n't like too much this color , but is as shown in the bottle , i use them in my salon but people does n't ask for this color so i will not buy again
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
2	i recently tried and liked nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href juice beauty blemish clearing mask 2 fl oz dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 juice beauty blemish clearing mask , 2 fl oz a nbsp so i was very curious to try this product first , it is worth noting that this is sunscreen , not just lotion that happens to have spf in it i say this because the name initially threw me off since it is called moisturizer and not sunscreen but from reading the packing and applying it is definitely sunscreen i say this because i regularly buy both and while lotion with spf is my go to on a day to day basis it 's usually not waterproof enough or applied in a large enough quantity to provide adequate protection if you 're wearing a bathing suit first , i 'll start with what i like about the product i like that it is waterproof for 80 minutes i also like that it is natural that said , i'm not sure this product is meant for my needs first , it has a very pungent smell admittedly , i tend to be sensitive to smells so if you are not , you may find yourself less bothered by the scent but i had my boyfriend , who is less sensitive to smells than i am , try it and he too found the smell strong and unpleasant it reminded me a lot of household cleaner , which i was n't expecting since the other juice beauty product i 've used has no scent at all it also seems to sting my sensitive skin a bit i was n't expecting that because again , i 've really liked the other juice beauty product i tried it 's also quite thick i got this with the intention of using it on my face , but it feels too heavy it also gives no indication of whether it is appropriate for acne prone skin so i'm a bit nervous it could clog my pores because of that , it seems more appropriate for my body , though functionally i have an easier time applying sunscreen with a spray based on my experience , this just is n't the sunscreen for me while it 's not natural , i 've been much happier with nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href neutrogena clear face break out free liquid lotion sunscreen spf 55 3 oz pack of 2 dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 neutrogena clear face break out free liquid lotion sunscreen spf 55 3 oz \( pack of 2 \) a
4	i really love the feel and results of this exquisite body lotion while i have tried many different types of lotions , drugstore , natural foods , to avon , and department store brands so if this one really had a more appealing , almond fragrance , i would have given it a solid 5 stars it 's not offensive , and i am very sensitive to smells and chemicals , it does n't really have that sweet almond fragrance that i expected , but it is so outstanding , creamy , absorbent at so effective at softening the skin that the slight disappointment in the fragrance , is easily overlooked while it is an expensive product , it really spreads like silk , but absorbs like no other product i have ever used it really is a and i love that since it only requires only a scant amount the jar even feels satiny and has a nice heavy weight to it , great packaging and an exceptional skincare product that will last much longer than other products with better results i love it ! \( this review was written by my wife \)
3	my skin is very dry in the winter i 've tried so many products , including pure argan oil , olive oil and expensive cream i had a great experience with ahava 's hand and foot cream , so i purchased this facial cream i was not blown away my skin was n't feeling replenished at all and it felt dry , still , despite the thick layer i put on my face then , i got this nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href pevonia rejuvenating dry skin cream 1 7 ounce dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 pevonia rejuvenating dry skin cream , 1 7 ounce a , which cost me less , because of someone 's recommendation , and i was blown away my skin is visibly healthier and feels more hydrated i think this ahava moisturizer may be good for the warmer times i 'll skip it until the spring
5	best price around , beats the mall
3	i bought as a replacement for my beloved but discontinued lipstick by jane iredale , at the recommendation of a ji customer service person the is similar , but darker , more opaque , and less creamy than the was it 's still a great shade of red that works nicely with my fair skin and copper hair \( not easy to find , believe me \) , but it 's not a true replacement it 's only a best i could do kind of replacement for everyday , i find that nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href jane iredale just kissed lip plumper dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 jane iredale just kissed lip plumper a nbsp in is a better choice for me , even though it has to be applied more often
3	my wife and daughter , and l used this skin oil several times we all said the same thing about it we liked the way it felt on our skin , making it feel silky smooth and hydrated it was a little on the heavy side , feeling just a bit too oily , but not overly greasy we liked it a lot when using it after being in the hot sun and pool it 's not something we 'd use every day we had various opinions about the fragrance i thought it was pretty nice , the women not so much they called it a little overbearing overall , a fairly good skin oil but in our opinions it would n't wind up in our shopping
4	i do n't tan on purpose yet i like to wear clothing that my legs in summer i am a pale person so i like a little color not to glow like a ghost this year i have gotten more sun than normal and even though i wear sunblock my arms and face are darker than normal but not tan i use this product on only my legs it has a pleasant mild scent as far as self tanners go it dries well enough it does n't rub off on my sheets if i shower , apply it like a moisturizer and go to bed what i do like is it adds color gradually if you use it daily it washes off my hands and if you get to much in one spot it 's so light that by the next application it blends in i ca n't use it everyday because it does n't match my skin tone it appears slightly orange after 3 4 days so i let it fade and then use a few days later i think it is starting to blend better since i have been wearing more and getting some real sun if you are tan naturally it might give you the warm glow i like it , it is n't perfect yet probably better than any self tanner i have used in the past
4	like the product packaging and subtle minty tingly shampoo i think my hair is less i have more good hair days since i began using this , the cilantro conditioner and dirt styling product not sure what happened with the dandruff guy but i definitely have not seen any dandruff or anything but improved hair quality
4	not bad for wrinkles , but it irritated my skin a bit the first time i used it i do n't plan on using it anymore
3	i could not figure out how to use the dropper and the instructions said nothing about it i do n't see the point as it 's messier than pouring foundation into your hand in fact , the dropper spilled a drop on my outfit and stained it to the point it was worrisome whether it 'd come out it did the reason it took work to get it out is because this has zinc oxide \( for the sun protection \) so you may want to be sure you 're over the sink when applying it and not wearing your best clothes the color worked well for my pale skin and it made my face look even as best as it can no product can make it look completely even the scent was practically non existent , which should please a lot of folks if you 're using this for spf protection , you 'll need to reapply every two hours most people i know do n't reapply foundation that often so the spf benefit is n't a great one as it 'll mess up your blush better to use a clear lotion for spf than foundation that is supposed to be the make up base the button on top of the dropper is n't easy to press bliss needs to redesign the bottle to make it easier to apply without worrying about messes i would n't count on this for sun protection unless i know i wo n't be gone more than two hours
5	this is a good color it looks somewhat darker on my nails than the product photo i do like the goth red i also find that it lasts pretty well , and does n't chip as much as other polishes sometimes do
2	there are two major drawbacks to this flat iron 1 \) the outside casing gets extremely hot hot enough to burn your fingers when you clamp it down and 2 \) it does not have an automatic turn off frankly , i 've switched back to my 30 remington flat iron this is just not worth the price
3	this concealer applicator , quite pricey at the time i'm posting this review , seems like nothing special to me it 's like the ones i can get at my local drugstore for just a few bucks , and i do n't see enough difference to justify the cost the sponge end is good at applying concealer , but it also does tug at my skin in all fairness , so do the other applicators i 've tried the foam tip seems a good quality , finely textured foam the plastic end is shaped to scoop out concealer without sticking fingers in the pot , and that does work well this is a good quality tool , but when i need to replace it \( they do wear out , of course \) , i 'll get a more generic version
5	i used a different skin care line for years , and recently tried just the hydroplane shave cream , and now i use the full billy jealousy line trust me , this is great stuff i have super sensitive skin , and after i shave no nicks , cuts , or irritation if it works for me , i'm sure it would probably work for you and not to stray from the point , but gillette fusion pro glide is the best razor there is trust me again , i 've tried them all and no , i do n't get a if you buy that razor lol
5	great color
3	i absolutely loved this color online but unfortunately was not a huge fan the color is pretty but the overly frosty color makes it somewhat unappealing it is more challenging to use an iced color than the other cnd shellac colors
5	i have been using the proraso shave cream with great success i purchased this soap in the bowl to support a recent vacation as i did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl this product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube , i did not experience any break outs as a result this is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates
4	antica farmacista 's bergamot ocean aria hand cream is a nice product since using the hand cream , i have noticed that my hands have become incredibly soft with the weather quickly changing , i usually reapply lotion to my hands several times a day after applying antica farmacista 's hand cream , i only reapply once at midday , because its moisturizing effects are long lasting i would have given this hand cream five stars , but i am not fond of the fragrance it is a bit strong and reminds me of an old woman 's perfume other than the smell , this is a great hand cream i will definitely be adding it to my collection of daily beauty products
5	this stuff is amazing i use it to remove my makeup and sunscreen and then follow up with a treatment cleanser prior to using bioderma , my cleansing routine felt very much as though i were smearing makeup around my face rather than actually cleaning it now , using the treatment cleanser on makeup free skin , i am getting the full benefit of that product
3	i'm usually an opi girl , but i saw this color on a lady and loved it the color is great , but the essie formula is a little watery \( i needed 3 coats \) i 'll probably be sticking to opi
5	i have to take over the of this , my wife usually the reviews but she wanted to give an honest critique of the product used by a man well , i like it it does what is is supposed to do especially the cleanser i work out heavily and my face feels really clean afterwards and this stuff even gets deep into my winter beard and that 's quite the task the toner , kinda smells like toothpaste to me i do n't have a pore problem but i am using all three steps to get the optimum benefits i notice that if i do a rush job on my face and just want to get to bed then the toner picks up a lot of the dirt that the cleanser missed the moisturizer this is the product that i like the most i have oily skin and once i wash my face the oil comes back really quickly not with this moisturizer it does n't feel thick and does n't have an overpowering smell i like the baxter line my wife has picked me up a few things from it from time to time but i never get around to reordering it i'm sticking with it folks at work have told me that my skin looks better , did n't know i had an issue , lol

5	i use a product with retin a nightly , and while it does a nice job smoothing out fine lines , it cause my skin to dry out and be sun sensitive i am also dealing with outbreaks of rosacea , so i need a gentle but effective moisturizer the mario badescu moisture magnet covers all of my requirements and is working very well this is a small , 2 oz bottle , but a little goes a long way a small dot is all i need to apply to my entire face it is thick , creamy , and has a very light scent it feels a little greasy when it goes on , but it is quickly absorbed without makeup , it leaves my skin with a glowing look and while i use makeup sparingly , it works well under makeup as a base and lasts all day
5	essie is the best nail polish for me and i love the brush
2	i think the best possibility of this treatment working is if you have a basis of good genes this does smooth out some imperfections , but it is sticky and more than that very expensive for any results that you might get it is an that your skin will begin to look like cindy unless your genes are aimed in that direction the directions say 1 or 2 pumps , massage into your face and neck in the morning and let dry then follow up with the rest of the meaningful beauty system personally it feels uncomfortable to have this on my skin during the day and my makeup does not look as good the advertised glow seems to come from the fact you have this gel like substance on your face , not from a skin improvement
4	this item was given to me for my review originally , i did not like the japonesque radiance primer i felt it was too thick and made little sense to use however , i read some of the other reviews and tried it with my skin cream i use http www amazon com lite lotion 8 ounce dp ref sr 1 13 \? ie utf8 qid sr 8 13 keywords , and i mention it specifically because it has no additional fragrances and works well with my extremely sensitive skin i do n't know what would happen if one mixed this primer with a moisturizer that has fragrance just saying anyway , i applied moisturizer first , let it sink in , then applied the primer and moisturizer mixed together over the top i liked it very much that way it gave my cheeks that glow , even after i applied my dry foundation this would be excellent for someone who does not wear makeup , but would like to give their face a fresher look i know as we age , our skin can get a ash like coloring , so this is a nice solution or if we are just looking tired , and as a wife and mother , that is relatively often it works with or without foundation so , yes , i am glad that i took the time to find out if i was using it correctly or if there was a better way to make it work for me it is a shame that products do not come with suggestions like in the reviews , but perhaps the company will rethink their packaging giving customers options means the product has a better chance of being successful
5	thick , creamy and covers without using very much i do n't want to feel as if there is a lot of product on my face so , having a little go a long way is not only good for but for how it actually feels the coverage is excellent for little discolorations , scars , or simply after not sleeping enough the color seemed like a true light to me , but not a super light no scent that i could discern another plus
5	this is a gentle cleanser that will probably work for most skin types it has a gel like consistency and you only need a dime sized amount \( or less \) to thoroughly clean your face it does lather \( but not a rich , bubbly lather \) and it rinses easily without leaving behind any residue this cleanser has a subtle herbal scent that i find pleasant this is my current favorite cleanser i love the way it leaves my normal combination skin feeling clean but not tight or overly dry my skin feels soft , and ive experienced no irritation , redness or breakouts while using this cleanser while i love the product itself , there is room for improvement with the container its really difficult to dispense only a small amount of the product , and with this price tag i hate wasting even a drop a pump style dispenser would probably be more efficient
5	i love this coverup and the applicator this concealer covered my age spot , large pores and tiny red i use this under foundation to complete a smooth , even facial tone i did not break out with acne after use typically this price point is high for me but the old expression , you can what you pay for would apply in with this product
3	i got this toner without realizing that it is actually meant for men and i am a female the scent of the toner is that classic harsh smell of alcohol mixed with peppermint it does a good job opening the pores and giving you that refreshed feeling after using it i do n't see any reason why it would be targeted toward men alone the scent of the product and use is really pretty gender neutral
5	after reading many reviews and trying out 2 other highly reviewed and value priced hairdryers , i settled on this babyliss the other dryers just did n't get hot enough this dryer is very quiet but has a air flow and the high heat temperature is hot , but not so much that it burns the scalp \( i use the concentrator nozzle \) i was worried about the weight , since so many others said it was too heavy yes , its heavier than most dryers at this price point , but i have n't had a problem with my arms getting tired even after the 20 25 minutes it takes to dry my hair \( i do exercise with regularly though \) i actually weighed it out of curiosity and it 's only 1 lb 11 oz for those looking to spend less than 35 on a hairdryer with a salon level high heat temperature , this babyliss what you need !
5	this is convenient foremost second it is not the same as filling up a spray bottle with regular water it actually hydrates i'm shocked very pleased this is going to be a dream come true in the summer i bought a 5oz to test it just got my big bottle today yup , i'm in love when this first came out to think i laughed
5	coola products are so wonderful that now this is all i use on myself and my family they are non toxic and smell fantastic !
1	chipped the next day do n't waste your money
5	as a fan , i could n't resist anyway although i do n't smoke , i confess that i love colognes that have tobacco element by m is a particular this scented wash has that same tobacco and leather combination , like a more refined and elegant version of english leather but it 's the bottle that grabs you as well as the it 's pretty fun if you are not a fan of pink and floral foam , do a complete with this manly scented wash in a whiskey bottle
5	i use several mario badescu products this particular one came highly recommended in an online makeup community the scent is wonderful \( if you do n't mind floral scents \) and feels refreshing and soft i love this spray i do n't use it for setting , so i ca n't speak to that , but i use it as a refreshing , hydrating spray throughout the day at work , and in my hair , as a refresher during the day it 's such an inexpensive product , you ca n't really go wrong trying it i do not find that the ingredients have changed much , save for a couple of preservatives \( which are very low on the ingredients list \)
4	color is a tad darker than i expected , but still nice a bright glides on easily and does n't chip excessively
5	this polish wo n't come off once applied , and it looks exactly as pictured my only qualm with the product is that it is pretty thick when you 're applying a coat
5	best eyeshadow ever ! if stila ever kitten eyeshadow i 'll die ! well i wo n't die but you bet i would be stocking up for sure but than again that 's just crazy talk they would n't discontinue this because it 's so amazing ! it 's sooooo soft and buttery , gives a great pop of color it will last forever ! the size is generous and its a little expensive but trust me soooooo worth every penny
5	gives great volume i use it daily my best trick is to hang my head up side down , spray and wait a few seconds i then spray with hair spray , wait again and then stand up the volume is so great i have to tame it a bit i have lots of hair but its very fine this works wonders
5	very satisfied
4	i was initially a bit hesitant to try this body cream since it is scented and i am sometime sensitive to strong perfumes but i decided to give it a try i am glad i did this cream is a medium weight product that smooths on nicely , absorbs into the skin and moisturizes well i find the scent of the cream more pleasing when applied to the skin upon opening the jar , the cream smelled rather harsh , perfumed flowers and baby powder i was pleasantly surprised when i applied the cream , the scent was , i could detect notes of sandalwood and spice in addition to the floral tones i found the scent to be pleasing but not overpowering and was happy to note that i had no adverse reaction to the perfume in the lotion the lotion also keeps your skin nice and smooth throughout the day and the light perfume continues for several hours after i definately would be hesitant to mix other perfumes with this lotion my only quibble with this lotion is the price point it is on the expensive side and i am on the fence about whether it is worth the investment to me , so i am one star
2	this is pretty dark orange and streaky , not a great color for fair skin
5	just put this color on my hands and feet luv it ! ! ! i would recommend this color to all my friends
3	well , i received the natural color of this product , and from the picture , it looks pretty normal , but i clearly do n't have what they consider natural skin tone i tried using it dry first and it seemed almost too powdery , did not really go on smoothly , at least not as nicely as some other powders i use then i tried using it with a damp brush as one might do with a liquid foundation as i was putting it on , it reminded me of trump in his early , that orange ish color that showed up on his face when he was on tv i ca n't say i was particularly enthralled with that look on me i brushed it on to a thin layer and it covered well enough , but then i felt i should put another layer of a different powder color on so as to look more like myself perhaps with the right color , i would have been more pleased , but i did n't feel this product was superior to other makeup products i had , so i will stick with what i know works \( i e love the laura and lancome foundations \) i do have older skin , and i did n't feel it did a lot to make me look younger i would be leery of buying this without being to actually test it , as the color was not what i expected from the picture
4	i have very fair , sensitive skin and this works great i applied it on top of my liquid foundation to keep the shine down it goes on evenly , leaving a smooth , matte look on my face it blends well with my foundation and is n't flaky or powdery it gives my face a nice , finished look without being heavy or cakey when i used it without my liquid foundation base , it did n't offer complete coverage , so this is definitely a complementary product not a use on its own product for my skin overall , i really like this
5	this lightly floral scented toner is my new security blanket in my skincare routine removing any residue i may have missed while cleansing and adding a little boost of hydration to my sensitive dry skin while i like to think my cleanser is completely effective , there are some nights where user error plays a factor on those nights i appreciate this quick , easy , and refreshing step before on moisturizer and into bed on other nights when i dedicate time to a careful skin routine , i still enjoy the addition of this perfecting toner i like how it feels on my face and how my skin feels softer afterwards
5	wonderful !
4	nice color not really for me
5	i love the crabtree evelyn hand cream i typically am a lotion and hand sanitizer user while lotion is great , sometimes once it is on my hands , there is not a noticeable , lasting difference beyond maybe a few hours or so where my hands feel softer the crabtree evelyn ultra moisturizing hand therapy , by contrast , has that lasting effect it goes on and does not feel greasy or weird my hands actually did feel softer for the entire day and over time i felt like this cream was perfect for combating the effects of the current weather on my skin cold and dry also , it smells fresh and natural , which was another thing i quite liked
4	holds heat well , sturdy and economical
5	this is like hairspray for your face it 's the best way to describe it it holds everything in place in a similiar fashion but it 's not sticky like hairspray it 's just an all over spritz that makes your face feel set my makeup does n't come off on my glasses , fingers or shirt when i use this item it just holds everything on your face in a nice form and fashion
5	easy to apply and works pretty well , baby cheeks are still red but not rough
4	this is a great scent i spray on my clothes and hair but avoid spraying directly on my skin as it is a bit strong i find that one spray is plenty although it is strong , the scent is pleasant and youll be fine if you do n't overdo it on the spraying this will last a long time !
2	returned it did not like how it went on or blended bare minerals primer is better for me
3	both my young boys have slightly wavy hair so i have to put something in their hair to keep it in place while they are at school all day we use mousse , hair gel , etc weve been using different jack black pomades for the last few days we did n't care for any of the pomades but the gel was probably the only one that we will probably use up for us , the wax and clay ones were just too hard to use the gel is more user friendly it states that it give a high shine and max hold i think the hold is medium not high by days end , their hair looks messy the shine is not really a shine but more of their hair looking greasy we are n't big jack black pomade fans
4	overall , i 'd say that this is a good product , although i do n't know if the price is justified the packaging certain does n't justify the price , since it has the look and feel of a drugstore product , but my review is n't about the packaging initially , i thought the cream was a bit heavy and thick however , is absorbed well and i 've used it under make up even though i prefer to use a primer under make up the reason for my 4 review is that i actually could feel my skin tighten slightly and my skin has better texture when i wear this than when i do n't the results can be felt are they visible results \? not to me
5	this palette comes in two designs , the and the nice the version features girls the shadows are the same i bought this palette on a whim from look i 've had it for a while now and i have to say that it is one of my favorite palettes many people wonder , i think , if this palette is an alternative to the urban decay naked palettes or if both or all is redundant i have naked 1 my mom has naked 2 i think that nude is more different from naked 1 and 2 than naked 1 and 2 are to each other this palette has several shades that are not even close to shades in those palettes i do n't know naked 2 as well , so i'm going to stick with naked 1 comparisons the pinks \( stubborn and \) , for example , are nothing like sin not only are the shades totally different , hey are more shimmery , like pinker versions of in naked 1 there is a burgundy color \( sexy \) in this palette , which i love is brighter than virgin is yellower than half baked serious is a true black naked 1 does n't have a true black \( naked 2 does \) there is no equivalent to i 'd say that the only real dupe is sultry , which is just like buck in naked 1 so if you are interested in this one , rest assured you can own the ud naked palette too and not find them redundant quality is also great the shadows go on well they are pigmented and buttery i do get some fallout if i forget to tap my brush but the fallout is pretty minor i do wear them with primer and get no creasing for more than 15 hours they also do n't fade
5	while not exactly like water , this white lotion quickly melts into skin and is invisible no residue no white mask type of look that many products have has a wonderful scent that lingers for hours it is n't strong and did not set off any perfume headache sunscreen is n't just for summer this is a really pleasant way to protect your skin
4	eau de rochas is a really pleasant , light perfume i like that it is n't a heavy , sweet scent but is a fresh , citrus and floral type of perfume when i first smelled the perfume , i was n't really impressed with it however , once applied it is much more pleasant and complex it is n't overpowering and simply smells clean and fresh my husband noticed i was wearing a new perfume and commented that he really liked it too the bottle itself is quite pretty and looks quite decorative on my dresser this would be a great perfume to buy yourself or to give as a gift
5	great color , lasts a long time
5	i love this lip plumper just wish it would stay on my lips longer i do reapply it often during the day still , my lips feel quite nice using it and i would definitely recommend it
3	i was hoping that oxygen infusion night cream would be more nourishing and hydrating than skyn cloud cream , which is a decent moisturizer but inadequate for dry skin i was disappointed i have very sensitive skin almost completely lacking in barrier without my regular concoction of serums , my skin is painfully dry in the winter i was hopeful that oxygen infusion night cream would help maintain some hydration in my skin , but it doesnt do much in that department its not for dry skin it doesnt add any value to my serums this cream is lighter and than cloud cream it either contains more water or more air it goes on with almost no drag but it stings and even burns if my skin is broken i attribute this to the fragrance , which is floral and perfumey so oxygen infusion night cream is not for sensitive skin among its active ingredients in gosulin agave skyn iceland does not use silicone in its products this is the primary reason that ive been trying their products , as i cannot stand silicone on my skin , and its difficult to find a moisturizer without it gosulin agave is a extracted from the blue agave plant it is an alternative to silicone , as it mattifies and creates a velvety surface on the skin the texture is more natural than silicone it doesnt feel like plastic but i find that the agent \( probably gosulin agave mixed with oils and sugars in the formula \) balls up and leaves bits on the skin when applied cloud cream contains a retexturizer , but its not gosulin agave and doesnt have this problem neither cloud cream nor oxygen infusion night cream have appreciable moisturizing properties theyre for normal skin , not for someone who badly needs hydration cloud cream is thicker and has much more drag but , once theyve been applied , its difficult to tell them apart or it would be , if the oxygen infusion night cream were not shedding little bits of retexturizer because they both leave a skin surface they feel the same silky smooth skin and no way to tell if it is beneath the surface this is one of the many reasons that i dislike the trend to put in so many skin care products its impossible to discern the effects of the product but i am surprised that a moisturizer at this price point is so irritating and bits of itself the ingredient list currently posted on amazon is there was a formula change this product no longer contains retinol or dimethicone \( silicone \) cloud cream contains retinol ingredients water \( aqua \) , caprylic capric triglyceride , butylene glycol , glyceryl stearate , hydrogenated ethylhexyl olivate , squalane , peg 100 stearate , phenoxyethanol , saccharomyces extract , root extract , extract , extract , vulgaris \( thyme \) flower leaf extract , alba \( willow \) bark extract , agave leaf extract , callus culture extract , root water , \( cranberry \) seed oil , rubus \( \) seed oil , aloe barbadensis leaf extract , simmondsia chinensis \( jojoba \) seed oil , hydrolyzed rice bran protein , , sucrose palmitate , root ferment , ceramide np , glycerin , , , xanthan gum , sodium hydroxide , sodium , stearyl alcohol , acid , pentylene glycol , hydrogenated olive oil , unsaponifiables , perfluorodecalin , citrate , camellia sinensis leaf extract , citrus aurantium \( bergamot \) fruit extract , citrus aurantium dulcis \( orange \) fruit extract , lavandula angustifolia \( lavender \) flower leaf stem extract , pyrus malus \( apple \) fruit extract , alcohol , eucalyptus leaf extract , olea europaea \( olive \) leaf extract , \( sandalwood \) wood extract , zingiber officinale \( ginger \) root extract , carbomer , caprylyl glycol , rose extract , lecithin , potassium sorbate , sodium benzoate \( component of icelandic glacial water contains soy \)
5	the clarisonic deep pore brush head fits my old clarisonic pro and new mia fit i splurged on last week i usually use the delicate brush head for daily use as my skin is sensitive , but i was interested to try the deep pore brush head as i get a few clogged pores along the sides of my nose so far , i like the deep pore brush head a lot the bristles are softer than expected , and it feels stimulating without being irritating to my skin i'm not sure it minimizes my pores , but the problem pores by my nose look clearer and better as it gets rid of white gunk i still get sometimes , plus this brush does a great job clearing the rest of my skin of makeup , dirt , and dead skin my skin looks and feels great afterwards and absorbs my face serum and cream really well i love using a clarisonic and part of the experience is that the brushes are great quality , including this deep pore brush head definitely recommended ps i 've posted pictures showing how the brush head fits different style , but the clarisonic itself is not included
3	i normally use liquid foundation but decided to try this powder camo because i have other dermablend products and like their quality it goes on smoothly but do n't cover as much as my liquid foundation i do several layers including a base primer but this powder still does not cover my splotchy skin tone as evenly it does look better if i with the concealer stick first , but that 's because the concealer is doing the same job as what a liquid foundation covers so while this powder provides some coverage , it 's really not enough for my skin tone
5	this is a pretty polish as all butter colors are it 's perfect is you 're wanting a color that 's dark with sparkles but do n't want to do black
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
4	this sunscreen works as advertised i 've been using it for a few weeks now on , particularly on weekends when i go running in the florida sun and do yard work , and there was no evidence of skin tanning or burn the bottle is rather small , so there is n't an apparent bang for your buck here over more economical sunscreen choices the cream is extracted from the bottle via a pump , but in order to get enough of it to coat one 's face , a lot of pumping has to occur first although it could serve as a post shower or post shave moisturizer for the face , it does n't fit that purpose as well as something like eucerin
5	interesting unisex perfume i liked the sandal wood smell and so does my wife there are several undertones of fragrance like floral and cedar like or some woody smell this is a scent that is distinctively different and can be a conversation starter in an setting highly recommended by me and my wife \)
4	first spritz lime , citronella settles down to a soft clean , maybe a bit floral \? scent husband thinks more like the fresh linen scent lol , i do n't this smells very good after it settles down and is fairly long lasting this is 2 oz bottle and of course like all philosophy products , has a statement on the box good buy for us
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	i have from gels , to creams so thought i give this pomade a try i have very fine hair so i have to be very conscious of what product i use and how much i put in too much of anything and my hair looks like its a matted down mess too little and i have an fly away mess my stylist had recently started using a pomade on my hair and i like the way it turned out so i wanted to try for myself first off i really like the scent of this product but it is very strong literally so strong that it is all i smell all day good thing i like it but not sure about everyone else i come into contact with each day feels this is much thicker than a cream or gel so if you have n't used pomade before start small its best to apply to dry or nearly dry hair when its wet my hair looks sort of flat once it dries i simply glide a small coating on my fingers and rub them together to get some heat in it and to smooth it out them simply run my fingers through my hair i notice it does n't go on nearly as evenly as my less thick pomade , so i often have to hit certain spots again to get it even i like how this product holds my hair all day other products seem to give up at some point this definitely has more i still have n't perfected the best way to apply this so that it is consistent day to day it seems like some days are just right others i put in too little its very thick and sticky so the natural tendency is to use too little its been a good introduction to this type of pomade and i am generally happy with the results the strong smell is still a question as is my ability to apply it consistently but otherwise i like it
5	long lasting worth it
5	my wife and daughter love products this product is fantastic according to website , the 360 line of obagi was geared for the 20 or 30 who are trying to maintain youthful looking skin i was n't sure if this product would be strong enough for my late 40s skin , but it was , and it worked it is a potent retinol that brought a younger looking skin to the surface when i first used it for the first week , it stung and my skin peeled a little , but that is exactly what it should do if its a worthwhile retinol i noticed a difference in my skin within the first week and it keeps getting better its lightweight and has a similar scent as the other obagi products \( slightly floral , slightly medicinal \) best over the counter retinol ive ever used !
4	michelle phan has some really great , truly interesting youtube tutorials of applying various combo 's of makeup while achieving different and looks , for various occasions , michelle them to look good on different facial and she has quite the internet following i have seen several of her video 's but do n't actively follow what she puts out there i was given the opportunity to order this palette free of charge by amazon , give it some testing and post my opinion on this product my research of this palette and makeup line em by michelle phan , brought up that it was manufactured by l'oreal cosmetics my drugstore makeup of choice is the l'oreal brand , \( although my first choice is to products on sales from the clinique and estee lauder lines \) upon receiving this life palette , my first impression was that it had a rather cheap dollar store presentation , this is deceiving the large main pallet and accompanying smaller travel compact \( which accompanied as a gift \) are really well made and protective of the various circles of product , i'm thinking that the white background of the palette lead me to that initial conclusion although the white most probably allow 's the user to better access the makeup color 's , a darker , brown or black background would have visually given the palette a richer more appearance \( as well as the messy residue look the white can take on \) also with the large pallet , comes a tool to remove the product circles and them in your own personal fashion mix in either the large pallet or to transfer into the travel compact , are also provided to classify your personalized mixes into the girl 's day out , coffee break , weekend brunch , or day dreaming look another application tool is provided with a small lip brush on one end and a shadow brush on the other the make up itself the eye circles have quite good pigmentation , the shadow 's hold up fairly well , especially since i have rather dry skin , \( even with an application of moisturizer beforehand \) i did n't care for michelle 's of the colors on this and moved them around several times till i found what worked specifically for me that is what is so great about this palette you it to fit your looks , your style the make up itself the lip color gloss worked very well for me , love the selections of colors , ability to achieve a flat colored or lush sheen effect the make up itself on the blush , the pigmentation is not the best i 've tried , it was lacking , but then my preference is to go on the light side with blush and add if needed but must be noted that when using any of the choices on this palette , the blush takes further application and definitely best applied with your finger , a quality brush in blending in will be useful on your cheek but considering the blush circle 's proximity to everything else in the palette , a one or two finger application first stage application is what i recommend , followed by a blending with a quality brush in conclusion this palette has a big fun factor , trying out different looks , making your own color combo palette while checking out michelle phan 's tutorial video 's , and foremost an value for the price
5	i picked this item up for my wife as i am already much to old to have anything help me old and slow that 's me my lovely wife , on the other hand , is someone i want to show off as looking twenty years younger than me so she wrote the review i 've been using this product every night for about three weeks now and although i do n't see a big difference , the area around my eyes does seem a little less dry the applicator is a nifty feature but i do n't like having to turn the bottle over to be able to see how much of the product is actually coming out i prefer to put the product on my ring fingers and pat it on , using a light tapping motion instead of rubbing it in per the directions \( pulling leads to more wrinkles ladies ! \) it does n't have an obvious perfume y smell , which i like it is a very rich cream , so a little goes a long way when i used the applicator on the top of the bottle , i squeezed out a bit too much and there was still some of the product around my eyes in the morning way too much ! i do n't know that i believe all the claims some products make about completely getting rid of eye wrinkles , but this product did some nice moisturizing so there you have it i hope this helps someone make an informed decision
4	i love anything lafco makes ! great product last long time burn wonderful and smell great !
5	literally the best eye mask on the market immediate results i love juice beauty
4	when i go out in the sun i do n't tan i rash so i always wear a sunscreen i have avoided sun damage because of that but not the soul sucking , drying winter heat so my hide can use all the help it can get they say it can also be used to prevent crepey skin supposed to use it with their intensive body repair the body polish is a very thin , lotion y product with scrubbing pearls in it because it is so runny you can empty half the tube before you start scrubbing so i squirt some out in a wide mouth jar and dip a folded washcloth into it for scrubbing it has a very light citrus scent no parabens and not tested on animals the ingredients are water \( aqua \) , sodium laureth sulfate , glycerin , acrylates copolymer , cocamidopropyl betaine , propylene glycol , cetyl esters , hydrated silica , \( \) extract , pyrus malus \( apple \) fruit extract , sativa \( rice \) bran wax \( cera \) , olea europaea \( olive \) fruit oil , butylene glycol , acid , citric acid , tetrasodium edta , lactic acid , sodium pca , sodium hydroxide , sodium chloride , xanthan gum , phenoxyethanol , chlorphenesin , benzoic acid , acid , fragrance \( parfum \) i was surprised that it really did make a difference in my skin and i think i will continue to use it
5	absolutely loved my purchase ! ! ! \) \)
3	polish seemed old dried a much darker color dissappointed
5	my wife loves this one we have been buying the same at amazon and other places for years from what i understand , this product is unique and works very well
2	i did not like this sunscreen at all , it made me look like a ghost
5	i like this much more than i thought i would initially , the scent is very sweet , but that diminishes and becomes more complex after a minute or two a little goes a long way , and it does last through the day bottle is done oddly \( top is loose and i wonder if it will stay on \) , but is eye catching
4	one of my recent samples has been mario badescu skin care products i started off with the almond and honey face scrub which was a pretty gentle scrub it smells awesome , i am a big fan of the sweet almond scent ! i give this scent 5 stars \) i scrubbed it onto my moistened face and rinsed it off , it left my skin feeling very clean and soft i then applied some of the seaweed cleansing lotion \( toner \) it smelled pretty plain and earthy the seaweed scent was just ok , but it left my skin feeling clean and tight next i applied a small amount of the ceramide herbal eye cream it smells like a non scented lotion this was just ok i then massaged the hyaluronic moisturizer \( spf 15 \) into my face and neck which also smells like a non scented lotion it went on light , its not really thick , which i liked out of all these products i loved the almond and honey scrub the rest of the products were just ok
5	i ca n't believe the dirt i get off my face with this been using bioelements for years and always use this product before putting anything else on my face
5	my last blush was a compact powder that broke and in my make up bag and i quickly tossed it out i had yet to purchase anything new , so this was the perfect item to receive for review the amount within is not much , but a little goes a long way and the color and quality are worth it i love that i can just swipe a little in my cheeks and blend in , it looks very natural , not streaky and there has been no skin irritation the price may be high on this one , but i actually believe it is worth it , which coming from me is rare overall i really like it and i 'll add this to my buy list for when it runs out
5	pretty topcoat have n't really have the time to test how long it lasts but i put it on with a cheap color and old base coat for and it did n't chip
4	the 3 oz size is and ok to go on an airplane with you here 's my original review for the 13 oz size i have combination skin as a toner , i really like this it does n't have a strong , identifiable fragrance at all , it goes on smoothly , and it feels nice after applying it , my skin feels good not dry , and definitely not oily but as a make up remover , i found i needed to go over my face two or three times to get most of the make up off i would not recommend this to remove make up i think it 's just too gentle \( which is great as a toner but eh as a make up remover \)
5	i 've been using this product lost daily for more than a year and am very satisfied with the results it works as described by anthony you know you get what you pay for except for free shipping with amazon makes this a no
5	dermablend smooth liquid camo foundation was thicker than i usually wear so that surprised me , but it went on smoothly and covered well the tint was perfect for me and the makeup looked so good it was n't messy or difficult to put on it wore well throughout the day and since it 's summer , oil from my skin did n't break through and look greasy i did n't need any more powder than the amount i put on in the morning after i apply foundation great makeup l definitely buy again
5	this facial cleanser was a pleasant surprise i really like it it is so generously portioned for the price and i love the pump bottle the bottle is actually blue \( i thought the product was blue it first but as it turns out it 's just the bottle that is blue so do n't be worried about artificial dyes in your facial cleanser \) as far as use of the product \? i enjoyed the marine oceanic scent it has a great foaming lather and only about a quarter size was necessary to cleanse my entire face it is ph balanced to handle sensitive skin and did not bother my rosacea at all no irritation whatsoever and it got the job done efficiently , i was able to apply my daily moisturizer after using this product with no leftover residue or buildup from the cleanser great product at a great price ! good value !
4	the first thing you will notice about this moisturizer is the unique pump it works fine so far but , at this cost , you will want to get the last tiny little drop of the cream and i do n't see a way to remove the cover pump although the contents are clearly listed as 1 7 fl oz , the size of the jar gives the impression that you 're getting much more product the ingredients are not listed on the jar and the printing on the box is so tiny you probably wo n't be able to read it so click on the thumbnail pictures to the left of the product page to read the ingredients there is no sunscreen in the moisturizer which is an important consideration for me i expected a citrus scent , considering the ingredients , but it smells sort of like lemon pledge or orange glo cleaner not bad , just not what one would expect from a moisturizer really , who wants to smell like a coffee table \? as for results the moisturizer goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly i like the way my face feels but , to be honest , i really ca n't tell that my skin looks any better than it does with another moisturizer i use which is about a third of the price for 1 7 oz and contains a sunscreen
5	bought this for my husband he never wears sun protection and living in fl and being a sun thought it was time he started using it he complains about all other face moisturizer except this one , it is a keeper update he has officially asked me to order him another bottle and did n't even ask about the price \( which is a first \)
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	i purchased this at nordstrom as part of a complete foot care regimen i live in the desert and i wear heels for work every day my feet are dry and after using swiss foot file , i used the soft crme this lotion is amazing , my feet immediately felt motorized and softer i even used it on my legs the crme is definitely less expensive on amazon than at nordstrom i definitely recommend this to rid yourself of dry cracked feet you wo n't regret it
4	this works well as a face refresher it does n't feel like a moisturizer but more a temporary lift for your skin , or moisture you moisturizer will help to seal in i 've been on the fence about whether this is a worthy buy or not i like the way it makes my skin feel but i'm not sure it does enough to make it a necessary part of my daily regimen i think it 's best for a me me up for your face throughout the day and if you need that , it 's a worthy buy , there 's really no smell and no chemicals to irritate your sensitive skin , both of which are very important to me
3	the cream is a bit too sheer if used over moisturizer if not over moisturizer , it feels a bit too dry i wish it felt more silky going on the color was fine for my light skin , but midway through the day my face felt dirty sort of like that icky sweat travel skin you get when you are on the go only i was n't on the go , it was an ordinary day i ended up washing it off at 3 00 pm i got the sample in my birchbox , and it 's enough to use several times each time i 've tried applying it differently , but really do n't care for it i prefer origins foundation , which is light and sheer but with good coverage
3	i have several issues with this product the box claims that this product immediately improves skin tone and elasticity around the eye area in actuality , tiny wrinkles around my eyes were more evident after using this product and while i usually do not show puffiness around my eyes , puffiness under my eyes is sure evident after using this product i get much better immediate results from my less than twenty dollars neutrogena healthy skin eye cream while this product is definitely fragrance free , it also does not refresh or brighten as claimed in fact , this product makes me want to rub my eyes i get much better results from my very refreshing and , again , less than twenty dollars , beauty super brightening vitamin c eye gel i can only use this product at night why \? it does not soak in very quickly at all the first few times i applied this in the morning , after waiting a half hour for it to soak in , i finally gave up on applying my usual light eye shadow and went without and as the first hours go by , it seems that moisture constantly in the outside corners of my eyes i end up constantly wiping the inside and outside corners of my eyes and that is not a helpful healthy thing to be doing so , now i only wear it at night top main ingredients of this product are water , glycerin , \( an oil free emollient \) , isononyl isononanoate \( a synthetic emollient \) , wax , and even a few more in the same category the claimed beneficial ingredients come after that the pump is terrible it is tiny and very short , so my finger is always touching it as the lotion a full push down on the pump head results in way too much product a short push down is very hard to attain so , i end up with way too much or too little time wise , the pump is definitely not efficient i had high hopes for this , considering the price i will continue using it in the evening , right before bedtime who knows what its benefits will be over an extended period of time \? is it worth the wait \? is it worth the price \? is it worth giving it a try for the price \? i just do n't know what i do know is that i am going to stick with my healthy skin eye cream and my beauty super brightening vitamin c eye gel
5	i have very difficult dry skin due to a health issue genetics and also have eczema on occasion my skin really loves this lotion , it sinks in a bit deeper and leaves less residue than other body lotions i 've used i also love that it 's fragrance free , i work outdoors and sometimes fragrance can attract , which is a real pain ! nothing like being attacked by no because you happen to smell like a big flower , boy they love perfume my skin needs a better quality lotion than i can find otc , and this one competes well with those i 've purchased from spas in fact , i believe bioderma is a product that 's carried in spas , but i'm not entirely sure i like to give a good exfoliation to my skin before using any product because it just would n't be fair to review it any other way with a thick layer of dead skin preventing decent absorption i also like to shave my legs , etc because my skin tends to resist any of lotion if i have doing both of these preps makes a big difference , and i noticed that my freshly scrubbed and shaven skin does n't sting after applying this lotion , so it 's gentle that 's an important point since my skin can stay irritated for hours and days once it gets started down that path i also do n't notice any ingrown hair \( s \) which can happen to me quite readily the day after shaving if a product clogs my pores so far that has n't happened so i'm very pleased the spots where i have eczema \( right now an elbow and knee \) do seem softer and less red and irritated this is a more occlusive lotion that keeps water from from the surface of the skin and does n't depend on a lot of oils to moisturize however , it does contain mineral oil so people with acne on the body might have an issue with this ingredient i 'd do a patch test if this is the case just to be on the safe side otherwise , this product really works well for my dehydrated skin and i love that it is n't sticky \( wo n't stain my clothing in hot weather \) and does a great job of absorbing well into my skin
5	bright , bold and beautiful for summer
5	this eyeliner applies very easily and has a creamy texture it seems to last throughout the day i do n't wear contacts , so ca n't say if the claim regarding that is true , but there is no irritation on my eyes at all wearing this
5	very light and fresh scent that cleans without stripping skin on a few occasions i have been to some fancy spa and gotten a facial i now realize that this is the cleanser they used a little pea sized drop thoroughly cleans my face of all my makeup and yet does n't leave my skin feeling tight or dry it is very gentle and my skin is n't at all irritated using it
4	this is an intriguing fragrance upon application , there are several different notes there was definitely a powdery aspect to the scent , but a sophisticated powder warm , with almost an oriental quality , perhaps due to the amber listed in the description the description also notes that this fragrance is supposed to have an of vanilla there is a subtle air of vanilla , but i certainly did not find this to be dominant still , i liked this scent and was interested to see how it developed on my skin unfortunately , it became more subtle rather than more complex although i liked the fragrance , as time wore on , i could barely detect it on my skin it was certainly a pleasant , soft fragrance , but quite light in the end , i found that this fragrance offered a subtle if refined scent of powder and light vanilla as noted , it 's quite pleasant , although perhaps not worth the price tag overall , i rate this product 3 1 2 stars
5	this is a really good moisturizer for men 's skin it does not really have a smell to it which is good , if you are like me , then you do n't want your skin to smell like flowers , perfume , or candles or other crap that women use as their body lotion this is designed for men so it will not smell like you used your wife 's moisturizer the bottle is a big bottle and you only need a few pumps from it to coat your skin so it will last you a long time it is nice to use right after a shower and it makes your skin smooth and keeps it from drying out and cracking a men 's product that i will continue to purchase

2	i found this product to be frustrating , not terrible but not worth the high price firstly it the packaging sin of having twice as much space in the box as the tiny little bottle takes up there is literally no reason for it to be in that size box , except to imply that the consumer is getting more product than they are actually getting it has a very strong , distinctive smell which i personally did not prefer for my face it lingers because the serum is an oil base , so you still get whiffs of the smell long after you 've applied it it takes a while to sink in due to the oily nature of the product while i think this allows for a good concentration of the hyaluronic acid component , it 's a little unpleasant if you accidentally touch your face before it 's absorbed i strongly dislike this brand 's lack of a transparent disclosure of ingredients i want to know exactly what i'm putting on my face this information is severely lacking they say that it 's hyaluronic acid and oil , but that 's it i'm sure there are other additives
3	i have used this for a while , i ca n't tell the difference between this and vaseline intensive care skin cream the reviews are great , maybe i have the wrong skin for it it was not hydrating enough
2	i do n't see any difference in my skin after a month of use for such a high price tag , you would expect results the only thing i see is an oilier skin appearance towards the middle of the day looks super oily in photos no negative skin reactions though , which is good not recommended for the price
2	i used the eyelash conditioner for three weeks and it seemed to be fine i am not sure if i get much improvement to my eyelashes in this short period of time , although the package says to wait 3 4 weeks to see the results then i got an eye infection i know it is not from the product because i know who i caught it from , but now i cannot continue using the product i probably had used it during the period , so the bottle might contain the germs that made me sick i was skeptical about them having six months supply of the thing precisely for this reason when you apply the conditioner to your eyelashes , you obviously touch them , so you introduce your germs to the bottle where they can possibly at their i do understand the manufacturer 's of saving a few pennies on bottles but i would prefer to be on a safe side and have smaller packages for hygiene reasons it was easy for me to apply even though i cannot really see anything with glasses off close one eye and swipe the tiny brush on the lashes trying not to touch your skin repeat for the other eye
5	the perfect kit to address all the concerns of acne prone skin it helps fight my oily skin in my t zone and the dryness i have on my cheeks the smell is great too !
5	i could n't believe i found this for such a good price i was a little skeptical about buying cologne online but this made me a believer my hubbie has had it for about 6 months now and it still smells great on him it 's not watered down at all and is a quality product at a reasonable price i will be ordering more soon
5	i bought this on a whim i love thebalm products i'm so glad i got it ! over a purple shadow it will make a matte a shimmer if you spray it with fix it makes shadows look almost like duo chrome and when i'm being lazy and do n't want to blend like i should it 's a great transition color that blends the colors together a must have in any makeup bag collection
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
3	this product has a smooth feeling , and is absorbed quickly in fact , my skin actually felt just a little dry \( though it was n't \) after applying it i am thrilled at the almost undetectable scent i am also happy that it is free of preservatives i have n't found a difference in the little lines on my skin , but will see what happens over time i found that a small amount of the product is enough to moisturize and smooth my skin in addition to peptides and niacinamide , the ingredients include tea tree oil , vitamins c and e , selenium , and a host of other ingredients , with long names , one with polymer as part of the name instructions say that for best results , this product should be used after the corresponding tizo foaming cleanser , though that may be a financial challenge for some my sensitive skin did not have a problem with this product i will continue to use this product and report back if and when i \( i hope ! \) see greater improvements in my skin seems to be a good moisturizer for those not too fussy about getting organic ingredients the price is a bit out of range for some of us , but i imagine the 1 fluid oz package will last a good long time recommended to those who like a kind of dry texture and can handle the price
5	i love false lashes , but found them too expensive for me and felt i was losing lashes because of them this mascara is a great second it lasts all day with no under or over eye trace it removes very easily with wash cloth , but will last through a hot yoga class
3	takes a minute to get the hang of it , but it does seem to work those thinning areas do get blended away but i honestly do n't feel it 's worth what the company sells it for little too much hype for actual performance
3	i have chemically treated colored hair the conditioner smells great but it is very watery i prefer a creamier conditioner it left my hair limp and lacking body
4	this is the only product of this company i actually like
5	i love this brand of polish ! i love the colors and the fact that it lasts a long time without chipping ! the top coat also helps it to dry really fast saving me lots of time !
5	i loooove essie polishes they wear great , do n't chip , and have dozens and dozens of colors you ca n't find anywhere else this color is vibrant and has the tiniest and i mean tiny amount of sparkle to it it is a great go to color for when you ca n't decide at the salon for all ages ! \) i highly recommend this one , ladies \)
5	bought i for my sister , she loves it , i have bought it several times for her
5	it is good treatment for
5	nice and bold love it
5	wow ! beautiful color deep color but with a sheen that shows more than just a simple violet color so worth the crazy 15 for nail color i wo n't use the many nail color brands with all the un healthy in most products what is that about \? why risk more chemicals that darn sure ca n't be good to put on your body not with a beautiful alternative
5	i love the color only needs 2 coats
5	this lip plumper is a lightweight and lasting product the color is great the jane iredale product line speaks for itself for quality this seller sells this product at an economical price i would order from this seller again
4	this sunscreen provides excellent coverage and protection i like that it does not really have a sunscreen smell to it , and the scent is very mild i applied this before leaving for a sun filled afternoon , and it was not greasy or oily however , the zinc oxide does make it very thick , so be prepared to really work the cream into your skin also , the zinc oxide creates a white tint , but the more you rub it into your skin , the less white it gets i am very susceptible to sun rash , and this product prevented it mineral based sunscreen looks and feels different than regular sunscreen , but the benefits are exposure to fewer chemicals and longer wear time i'm very pleased
5	ca n't beat opi polish and ca n't beat the price on amazon ! a winning combination for me
4	i have dry skin and i really love this product the sensation of it on your skin is very soothing as it hydrates the skin rather well it works great as a base keeps my foundation and blush in place all day a lot pricey but it does as advertised
4	it is a little brighter than i expected it to be but that is only a personal preference wish they had the same color but slightly softer
4	i was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves i like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and i am not made of money ya know as a mass produced soap it 's actually really nice it loads well , though i will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones the scent is nice and has some staying power the slickness is about average i would say and it provides decent cushion is this the best soap in the world \? nope is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point \? absolutely one of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from proraso this is their sensitive skin formula \( and i have some sensitive skin \) let me just say a preshave is a must i use an oil but you could use theirs as well a good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti inflammatory properties
4	essie is my favorite polish love all the different colors
5	love love love this color ! ! !
1	i tested this on a 70 degree sunny winter day in houston this is a creme , not a lotion , it is so thick that it 's hard to spread this is the type of sunscreen that goes on with a thick pure white color \( due to the zinc which blocks the sun 's rays \) and you have to work hard to spread it so you do n't look ridiculous as if coated in white paint it is very thick and greasy and made my skin feel uncomfortable and hot this is a gloppy creme product that feels like a thick layer over your skin , that your skin ca n't breathe or sweat , and that made me feel that the temperature was hotter than it really was i tested it also on my face and could not take it , way too greasy , so i washed that off immediately another negative is it has five different parabens in it rating 1 star hate it it is unusable to me to to compare i use a spf daily face sunscreen by eltamd in clear , just to show that you can indeed find a clear \( not white \) light very wearable , non greasy facial sunscreen product
3	this is a good decent set of bubble bath the scents are pretty mild so not to overwhelm you in a hot bath the bubbles do not bubble up super well , and my skin was incredibly dry after using it but , for bubble bath it was pretty good !
5	the seaberry styling cream smells really nice my hair is shoulder length and somewhat fine , and i use a partial pump when my hair is wet doing so does turn out a nice effect i let my hair air dry , and it seems to help with flyaways , and when i wear my hair down it keeps it in a manageable style all day 5 stars ! that being said , i like to wash my hair every other day , but when i use this styling cream after washing my hair in the morning , it feels greasy the next morning just be aware
5	i use this every day , but i also shower at night and no poo my baby fine hair every few days if you do not , then the fibers might get on your pillowcase with a new bottle , i peel off the plastic tape that is covering the shaker , then tape off 1 2 of the opening with blue painter 's tape otherwise too much will come out too fast you do not actually shake this on to your hair , but instead into your part lines part your hair , hold the bottle at 45 degrees or so , and gently tap the fibers into the part while holding your other hand over your forehead to keep fibers off from there you may have to do a quick wipe of your forehead with a tissue if you have a lot of fibers on your forehead , you are tapping too much and too hard or you did n't seal off 50 of the shaker with painter 's tape it does not take a lot to make your hair look fuller , just a tap tap tap and them move on to the next area this would not work well for extensive baldness \( nothing does ! \) , but works well for the dreaded wide part problem dark hair would be more of a challenge on a light skinned person , as the contrast between hair and scalp would make the fibers show more than with medium brown hair they have a really small travel size that i carry in my handbag , so you can try it without spending much you would not have to tape the shaker part on that one ! one suggestion for toppik company is to make the darn container transparent it is completely opaque , so there is no way to know when you are running out , except to shake it in the sink dumb , as people would order sooner , if they knew they were running low
4	in general , our household tends to avoid expensive makeup i know quality often comes at a price , but usually average priced makeup products suit our needs while this foundation is pricey \( to me \) at 30 for 1 65 ounces , it does go a long way it also is spf 20 while containing no preservatives nor fragrance the maker lists it as fragrance free , paraben free , oil free , non comedogenic ingredients dimethicone , , dimethicone crosspolymer , , tocopheryl acetate , silica silylate , perlite , disodium stearoyl glutamate , retinyl , aluminum hydroxide , may contain titanium dioxide , iron oxides it comes in 5 shades 01 ivory 02 light beige 03 sand 04 golden beige 05 honey beige the light beige goes on evenly on fair skin and provides spf 20 sun protection , and does not looking unnatural you need to apply very little , a dab the size of a dotted among your cheeks , nose , neck and forehead can be blended in to cover your face evenly the foundation looks very natural and blends easily and evenly it does a nice job covering blemishes and evening complexion while not looking or feeling heavy , or making you feel like your pores are clogged it seems to work well on sensitive skin and there is no resulting irritation or break out after it is removed at day 's end
3	the packaging and presentation is nice set comes with 12 sleek looking black sticks wrapped into a small package along with a small container of an olive oil like product along with a story about vincent in it along with his looked pretty stylish and polished to me i liked the presentation despite it not being very practical or useful this is quite pricey for a small tube of a product with olive oil in it just to do whether this is a gimmick , i'm not sure but it worked ok but then again why do you need this to fix your make up or do a touch up \? i'm sure i can think of other ways to do it that are n't as expensive an interesting idea but i would n't say it 's a requirement to have this to do touch ups i'm torn between 's and i like it , middle of the road not a bad idea , would make a cute gift , just overpriced i 'd say
4	this is a very pleasant product with no residual greasiness and somewhat reasonable spf coverage i like the bottle , the texture and the way it makes my skin feel soft and rejuvenated the price is somewhat steep at 40 and that is the only negative quality makes for a great gift
1	the smell is awful !
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
5	it was a little dark for my very pale hands , but looked great on my mom it 's a good color to have even to just do a trendy nail
5	la roche posay substiane serum feels good on my face and neck i'm in my 50 's and have sensitive skin that gets really dry i use one or two pre measured pumps of substiane serum on my face and neck \( avoiding my eye area \) and apply my regular face cream over this serum a couple minutes later which leaves my skin feeling nice and comfortable all day \( or night \) this serum has a richness i enjoy as it feels soothing to my dry skin , yet it does n't feel greasy or sticky to me it smooths and hydrates my skin and seems to make some fine lines appear a bit less noticeable this serum has a firming feel i look for in products as my skin has lost elasticity with age substiane serum is a white , creamy serum that 's rich and thick , but applies smoothly and my skin absorbs it well i like that this serum has no parabens \( a controversial preservative \) it does have noticeable fragrance , though it dissipates quickly and does n't aggravate my allergies or irritate my skin overall , i really like substiane serum as it has a rich texture that feels hydrating , firming and soothing to my sensitive dry skin
5	this is a great , lightweight full coverage foundation goes on smoothly and does not look cakey or flakey on my skin i am typically fussy when it comes to my facial products , so i was skeptical when i first ordered this however , i was pleasantly surprised to see how flawless this product worked for me it smoothes my skin , minimizing and making me appear to not be wearing foundation \( but my face looks amazing \) i had never heard of dermablend before i ordered this , but i am definitely sold this will be my foundation of choice going forward absolutely love how it makes my skin look and feel
4	i have baby fine hair , i was looking for something that would not weigh my hair done this works well to detangle i recommend
4	i liked this face mask it is easy to apply and only needs to be left on for 10 minutes as the product says it really does create a tingling sensation the smell of the product is n't my favorite but is n't the end of the world because it washes off my skin felt clean and tighter after use and i have n't had any blemishes since i have used it
5	thanks so much !
5	this is one of my favorite eye creams it was recommended by the dermatologist and really works i am very happy with this eye cream as it seems to fade away the fine lines and wrinkles and helps with the undereye bags i have now started using the revision face wash , vitamin c cream , and moisturizer
3	the body and shower gel smells very nice it lathers well , and leaves the skin nice and clean and does not seem to dry out the skin it seem to wash the hair well , too i am confused about the description of the product it says it is soap free , but the second ingredient after water is sodium laureth sulfate , which is the main ingredient in most soaps , shampoos and body washes \( dish soaps and laundry detergents , too \) now i am curious what do they think soap is \?
3	i was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice , the consistency and color are great , the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish only thing is it wears like regular polish , chipped by the next day and the shine becomes lackluster quickly
5	this day cream is truly unscented , and very silky on my face , and while most creams are , this is the type of silk that i 've never tried before and it is also a nourishing cream too and a little bit of this cream goes a long way , so only a couple of dots are needed to cover my whole face and neck its absorbed fast and it can be worn under make up the nourishing effect to the skin is basically because it provides moisture keeping the skin of the face from looking dry in all , it 's a great daily moisturizing
4	pretty good color i only were opi bc they have the best colors i will purchase more opi thank you
5	i had bought a fragrance sampler as a gift last year from a high end beauty store , which was awesome it gave my boyfriend the opportunity to try out about 15 different men 's fragrances , so that we could determine which one works with his body chemistry and was pleasing to both of our noses together it actually turned out to be a pretty awesome gift and was a lot of fun that particular gift set came with a for a full size one of his choice , and in the end we had trouble deciding this john varvatos was our second choice , so i made sure to add it to my amazon list as a future gift this not only smells amazing , the price buying for the 4 2 oz direct from amazon \( i would n't buy from a 3rd party seller , personally \) was unbeatable ! it was the same bottle and box as i saw in the store buying this at sephora or ulta , it 's about 75 bucks , so i was a huge fan of the price here i would say this fragrance would span a variety of ages we 're in our early 30s , and it really suits him well it 's woodsy and rich , a bit mysterious the notes are , tonka beans , , wood , paste , oak moss , silver , white lavender , marine , , tobacco leaf , juniper berries , jasmine , orris root , patchouli , fir suede a really delicious , masculine scent he between this and a more aquatic fragrance depending on his mood this is definitely my favorite of the two he uses when he first started testing it out , i thought it might be too old for him , but after getting used to it , i really favor this scent he sprays 1 spritz in the morning and when he comes home after work i can still smell it i 'd buy it again in a heartbeat !
5	i will buy this product again the color is great and it feels so good will try other colors next time
5	love this creme i only need to use a tiny amount more like dabbing it on areas i want to cover and then blend with a cotton ball or fingertips it 's not greasy or oily but it does go on smoothly i rarely wear makeup for a full day so i ca n't estimate how it would hold up for ten or twelve hours , but it looks great for special occasions definitely makes my skin look more even in tone and consistency one small container will last for a long time little goes a long way it 's easy to remove with water or cleansing products it works with my skin tone but of course that varies with the individual so far , i'm very pleased
5	my favorite nail hardener ! this makes my nails so strong and it is the best product ever for brittle nails and nail that peel or chip ! !
5	good stuff i love the consistency and the moisturizing effect it has on my eyes love it
1	i saw no improvement which was a big disappointment it is a little tacky to put on but i wish i had improvement hope others do since i know everyone is different when it comes to topicals
5	i 've been a fan of mario badescu products for years , but mostly for preventing acne now that i'm older , i need to use moisturizing products i'm happy to say that the herbal hydrating serum has no scent it 's a gel serum that makes your face feel cool and smooth this is a 1 oz bottle , but you only need a tiny amount to use i used it over my moisturizer , but you can use it alone too i'm impressed with this serum recommended
3	i like the product , very easy to apply and a huge thumbs up for the packaging and ease of use via the dispenser , another thumbs up for no strong scent that i can detect that said , i 've been applying this daily for a week and really have n't seen any significant improvement i do n't have the crow 's lines , but i do have puffiness on the lower lid and i just am not noticing any improvement at all , in fact i had better results with an olay product that is half the price of this cream a very nice eye cream , and it seems from other reviews on this page folks are having better results than i am i would have rated it four stars , but for the very high \( for me \) price tag your mileage may vary
3	i have been natori customer for a while , although i must admit that all of my purchases for this brand were limited to their products their clothing line is fine quality and i was intrigued to try their body lotion i must say that lotion comes in elegantly designed bottle and it is easy to use \( no extra squeezing of the bottle needed , also lotion is the right texture too not too watery or too reach \) however , i find scent to bee too flowery and sweet it is ok for young women , but more mature customers may find it a little too i use it only on the weekends when it is time to go to bed or after i take shower after my workout and do not plan to go out in public so in a way this lotion has become my house bound body moisturizing solution until is all used up and after that , i do not think i will be using it again
4	the aroma of this lip balm is a mix of fruity and minty fragrances although the label says mojito flavor , fortunately i could not detect a flavor at all i do n't like flavored lip balms this lip balm feels good on my lips it is not sticky it is not thick and waxy like chapstick there is a slight shine to this lip balm , but not quite as glossy as a lip gloss i like that , but i'm female i do n't think it would be a good look on men
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	having been using this for a while love this ! nice fragrance
4	the l'occitane shea comforting cream does feels good on the skin it feels smooth and the addition of shea butter gives your skin an instant feeling of rejuvenation it is like just after treating your face an hour in a spa the smell is not offensive neither it also gives you a subtle aroma of shea butter my take on the negative side is it is thick like a pomade so it is hard to spread on the face it is not sticky , in fact it feels like you put powder once you have applied it thoroughly you have to rub it on your skin or else you can see its white color on your face
3	i do my best to take care of my skin , but after some bad experiences , am incredibly fussy about what goes on my face as a result , i'm only consistent with using a gentle non soap liquid wash , and being with sunscreen , especially because i'm outdoors a lot moisturizers , even gentle ones , can irritate my face , so i have n't been faithful about applying creams or lotions , much less those that work on the appearance of my skin , such as those with ahas or other helpful ingredients straight out of the tube , i was pleased with nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href baxter of california night cream aha dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 baxter of california night cream aha a 's creamy , non oily texture and the absence of fragrance and colored dyes i used the cream on the back of one hand daily for a week in place of my normal body lotion after it passed that test , i started using it on my neck , and on my face i use it three times a week rather than daily to avoid any issues with my skin and have gotten into the habit of applying a gentle moisturizer without aha on alternate nights thus far , when i apply this baxter night cream carefully and ensure that it is fully absorbed , i 've had no negative reaction , and am noticing that the texture of my skin is slightly improved because the cream is thick , i would caution you to apply it at least an hour before bedtime the one time i did n't , a bit got into one eye , but that 's user error and is not reflected in my rating of the lotion
3	it 's ok it leaves my hair very soft and smooth it 's not too pricey i'm just not crazy about using jars for conditioners too awkward and takes up space i do n't see any significant , visible brightening of my light auburn copper hair with this , but i do believe it my easily to fade red tones , so i do like that about it
4	getting accustomed to fragrance scent the non greasy softness and protection provided to the special guy 's no shave november beard and face is very much appreciated the fragrance \? not so much i 've been informed i 'll have plenty of time to get used to it since the beard will remain for the colorado cold season he likes the way his face and beard feels , so do i will be less to the eye and hopefully to my nostrils this season
3	i was trying a substitute for gel polish and these are nice , the consistency and color are great , the shine from the top coat is just like gel polish only thing is it wears like regular polish , chipped by the next day and the shine becomes lackluster quickly
2	la roche posay toleriane teint mattifying mousse matte foundation for oily skin and sensitive skin this matte foundation makeup for sensitive skin is presented by laroche posay , a french firm with a long , presence in womens cosmetics that is recommended by 25 , 000 dermatologists worldwide the firm states that it offers a unique daily skincare line developed using a strict formulation , stringent clinical testing for efficacy , safety , even on sensitive skin this foundation is said to be a large pore minimizer it claims to cover blemishes , absorb oil for matte even skin tone the firm recommends it for daily coverage states that it is suitable for oily skin , sensitive skin , will visibly cover skin imperfections blur pores , instantly absorb oil la roche adds that the cosmetic contains cutting edge smoothing that will absorb oil for all day matte skin it is , furthermore , fragrance free , paraben free , oil free , non comedogenic ingredients dimethicone , , dimethicone crosspolymer , , tocopheryl acetate , silica silylate , perlite , disodium stearoyl glutamate , retinyl , aluminum hydroxide , may contain titanium dioxide , iron oxides it comes in five different shades ivory , light beige , sand , golden beige , honey beige well , amazon vine sent this foundation to me in a shade , 04 honey beige , that is too dark for my skin , doesnt look good on me they can , of course , hardly be expected to know my skin tone the foundation does serve to minimize pores but this foundation turns a distinct orange color on my face , and , aside from the current american , few people want orange skin perhaps a more suitable shade might not do this ive no way of knowing meanwhile , i agree with other reviewers that youve only got to look at the foundation cross eyed to get blank spots , holidays , my dad used to call them and its a bit tricky to fill them in
5	this tanning mousse is a great product with fast results its a lightweight mousse that smells like vanilla , looks like chocolate milk , spreads evenly , blends easily , and gives an instant brown tan its not orange at all on me and has given me the most realistic looking fake tan of the many products i 've tried
5	i'm so pleased with this hair dryer because it is not too loud and not too heavy and clumsy also it is not as expensive as the ones sold at the beauty supply stores this dryer dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer and i really love the bright clean red color the only drawback i have is that the gets in dust and needs to be cleaned very quickly but its pretty simple to use a hair brush to brush it clean
2	too many coats have to be applied to get the color i was disappointed when i had to keep reappling polish is very thin
5	have not seen results yet i have only used twice but leaves my skin feeling so nice i love it !
5	this is the best system i have ever used i have tried high end like dior and essie on the low end this is hands down the best to do a clean looking manicure with high shine i got all the colors and the glossy coat for use after the top coat included in this set the whole thing is great and my nails are growing strong and healthy the price is great ! get you one !
5	this is one of the few under eye products that do not irritate my skin or eyes usually i feel a bit of a burn with these types of products , but this goes on smooth and i do n't feel a thing it works great under powder to hide my veins under the eyes i also apply at night before bed for long term results
5	high quality product !
4	vichy liftactiv supreme leaves your face feeling silky soft while the scent has a slight floral character , it 's very subtle as a man , i 'd feel totally comfortable using this product the cream is not too thick and not too thin or runny a little goes a long way it also has a gentle , cooling sensation and not the harshness of other products i 've used they suggest that it minimizes fine lines and i'm not sure that 's true but it 's a really fine facial cream and while it 's not cheap , the price is lower than other high grade facial creams that i 've so it 's a very solid product 4 stars
4	color great , too pricey
5	i have very dry hands and just spent 2 weeks in the drying this hand moisturizer is a life saver it feels great and my hands against cracks and i 've already ordered a back up tube i have had great luck with all of the baxter of california products i have used this is another winner
5	i had been using proactiv moisturizer and spot treatment to control my mild triggered acne but i was still plagued by breakouts in the same 2 areas along with red marks that lingered long after the bumps had healed so , i decided to give this a try since i have been pleased with other products by this brand after 2 days the red marks were noticeably lighter and now after about a week , they are gone i have n't seen any dryness , flakes or irritation i was amazed that this one product did a better job than the two proactiv products i 've been using for months

5	this is my second time purchasing this item it just works even though there is not much full winter here in east texas , this item keeps your lips from cracking and bleeding
5	i was delighted to have the opportunity to test a tube of la roche posay anthelios clear skin dry touch sunscreen spf 60 this is a brand that has impressed me in the past when traveling in europe , and in need of a good sunscreen i'm extremely pale , have had several of skin cancer \( several kinds \) , and i have an auto immune disorder that is \( in part \) triggered by sun exposure , so i have very good reasons to be a sunscreen connoisseur the sunscreen is a light cream , with a minimal smell the cream applies smoothly , quickly drying down to a dry touch this formulation is water resistant to 80 minutes , broad spectrum , oil free , and wo n't cause break outs no stinging or into the eye area it does n't have any oiliness after application , and does such a good job of absorbing oil , that dry areas of my skin continued to feel dry throughout the day this is a good thing in hot and humid weather , when you need every layer to keep your face from turning into a ! the sunscreen is broad spectrum , and contains avobenzone , which can be extremely important for those who are physically sensitive to the sun neither zinc , nor titanium dioxide provide the particular protection this ingredient does , though they are more stable outstanding sunscreen ingredients in a luxury skin care base highly recommended for normal to oily skin and or use in hot and humid climates
1	my husband has been using toppik for awhile now it is an incredible waste of money because this product would work only for people with very small bald spots my husband uses it to cover the whole top of his head , which looks like brown fungus growing out of his hair and in the sun , it actually turns a pinkish red \( he uses dark brown \) ! the claim that it can withstand rain or shine is a complete lie even with a bit of wind or humidity , the hair fibers leak down the sides of his face , making it look like tar it leaves a mess in the bathroom and on pillows and sheets i would not recommend this product just for the sake of sanity because my husband truly believes that i still do n't know that he uses the product ! toppik has really exacerbated his vanity about losing his hair using toppik has had a huge pyschological impact on him because he is always ducking his head in front of any strong wind , constantly wearing hats when he is not using the product , and is constantly checking to make sure the fibres are in place instead of just accepting the fact that hair loss is natural and inevitable and that it does n't even bother me , my husband constantly obsesses over his hair instead of enhancing his look , toppik makes his hair look incredibly fake and the fibers fall all over the place
5	got this for my husband who is really picky about his fragrance he loves nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href polo blue by ralph lauren for men eau de toilette natural spray dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 polo blue by ralph lauren for men , eau de toilette natural spray a nbsp and is really unwilling to try anything else with his birthday coming up i figured i 'd get him something that he can change up and it was a hit he loves the light not overpowering scent and so do i it 's great for both day and night if the man in your life like the stronger stuff then you might want to get something different this is definitely not your axe deodorant spray but for a real man 's man
3	the picture shows it kind of pinkish , at least on my screen i knew it would n't be the exact color pictured all products differ at least slightly from the picture but it 's really a pale brown color instead of anything even along the pink spectrum i 'll still wear it , but i was really hoping for a neutral pink color , and instead i got a brown that wo n't match much of what i wear i'm rather upset that it is n't what i expected , and i really do n't much like the color
4	this is a nice fragrance lotion to put on before going out to a party or dinner i have very dry skin , and use lotions for that issue , but this is not one i would use for that purpose josie should be used primarily for fragrance , not to help with dry skin it 's a thinner product than i'm used to using , but it went on nicely and soaked right in the scent is strong and lasted quite some time i got many compliments throughout the evening
4	this is a beautiful oil it 's light , so it feels like it almost instantly absorbs the scent is n't too heavy , but it is pleasant like a light spicy floral my skin feels velvety after usage , and not oily or over moisturized this is liquid gold in a bottle , just lovely !
5	its oribe need i say more
3	this is billed as a unisex scent but my first impression was of a decidedly masculine cologne , which i found very appealing however as it dried down , the woodsy notes fell away and the sweet black currant , plum and amber the final fragrance was almost identical to a juicy couture eau de parfum i recently tried not bad , but a disappointment compared to that brisk and promising first impression in terms of lasting power and sillage \( how much the scent permeates the air around the wearer \) , i 'd say it 's not as powerful as i 'd hoped for such a costly fragrance after two hours , the scent lingers but is extremely mild the appeal of the aroma is a matter of personal preference so that would not necessarily have my rating , but i think the fragrance itself could be a bit more powerful considering the price tag which this down to a three stars
5	beautiful feel when you put it on and wow a little goes a long way when this product first comes out of the dispenser it looks like cream but as soon as it hits your skin it feels like water and is absorbed instantly i have very dry skin and it made my face feel wonderful !
5	absolutely fantastic buffing brush besides being a perfect smaller size \( will not take up that much room in your makeup case \) , it fits wonderfully in your hand allowing for expert applications the bristles are strong , yet oh so soft use this for my blush application and the results come out professionally every time i cannot recommend a better brush for this purpose japonesque is known for they high quality products and this buffing brush is no exception
5	this polish goes on smooth , dries in minutes and keeps a manicure longer than using regular polish \( for me one week \)
3	this gel feels good going on , and my face does seem brighter and fresher after using however , i grew up in the days when baby oil and suntan lotion were used instead of sunscreen , so i'm not expecting miracles so why only a three star rating \? the product has absolutely no safety sealing the lid of the jar screws off with no protective band , and there is no safety seal underneath if i had bought this in a store , i 'd be afraid to use it i was still a little apprehensive , but i did try it because it comes straight from the , but why no protection \? the instructions are hard to find and hard to read i assume that you use it on a freshly cleansed face and follow up with regular moisturizer there is a label on the back of the jar , but it is on a transparent sticker and printed in light gray so i cannot read it at all you are supposed to leave this on your face for five minutes , then gently massage , then rinse off when i tried to massage , it felt too dry , so i used wet fingertips , and that worked well when i massage , i can feel the grittiness , the volcanic rock part , working and i did like the results while this is a good product , it could have been better with a little more care
2	too thick to apply properly would n't buy again
2	you gave me 2 little ones a the rest were the big ones
5	this is the first time i have used this type of product at home i was n't sure what to expect , but i am satisfied so far the serum is easy to apply and goes on in a similar way as moisturizer a little bit seems to go a long way there is a mild odor to this product , but since it 's rinsed off after 10 minutes , it is n't long enough to give me a headache shortly after application , the peel made my face start tingling then , it started itching this was since it only lasts the product is rinsed off it 's also clearly stated on the product label that a tingling sensation will occur with this product after using this product , my skin feels a lot softer i'm still waiting to see if it minimizes hyperpigmentation , but i am happy with what i m seeing so far one last note , i love the juice beauty does n't test on animals
5	this is nice and the colors are beautiful they blend like a dream and i enjoy the eyeliner that 's included
3	jack black protein boosting serum is okay it 's a light serum to be applied after washing your face , but in the four weeks that i and my roommate have used it so far , there has been no discernible changes either of our complexions if you have dry skin , you will need an additional moisturizer if you have oily , or blemish prone skin , this will likely be a good choice it 's light and does n't weigh down your skin for the price , i think that the results are disappointing there are superior products at lower price points , that will do a more effective job at giving your skin and even tone and texture and improving its appearance as with any products like this , you really do need to give it four to six weeks of consistent use to make a good evaluation on its efficacy
4	my wife uses this and she says that it does help to keep her skin looking fresher there are many people who are trying to make older skin look better keep in mind that these product 's effects are only temporary , but they do make a difference if you care about your skin , this is a good product to use occasionally it does seem to help with aging skin
4	satin pajamas is an opaque beige pink light mauve color looks classy and refined read that the all colors look darker in the bottle so keep that in mind if you 're looking for a nude color but want it to be opaque the cnd website says which colors are sheer , semi sheer or opaque
5	one of my favorite colors even though it 's not one of those iridescent colors that is made to change colors , it looks pink in some light a s coral in others not too baby pastel light , and not too dark just right
5	vichy normaderm beautifying anti acne care vichy is a brand that i love , as i have had experience with another one of their products this cream works well it is light not heavy and overpowering highly recommended
1	this is a very light , silvery color , not the darker gray
5	love the color i'm really into the darker colors i ca n't wait to see what 's to come in the future
5	beautiful lavender colour
5	i like la roche posay products i 've used another formulation of their foundation both work well i have also used their make up removers this foundation goes on smoothly , covers well , and lasts all day the color blends well into my skin i have sensative skin and neither this nor the other foundation by la roche posay caused irritation ir break outs
5	great neutral color for any season
5	great
4	ive been using this daily for 8 days has it done anything to improve my skin \? maybe it doesnt look any worse i had no bad reactions to it i already use salicylic acid glycolic acid cleanser nearly every day so i did n't expect dramatic change this is a serum so has that almost slimy feel at first but it does absorb quickly dries without stickiness unfortunately it does have a light fragrance not super heavy but it is noticeable \( light fruity scent \) i really do not like fragrance in my face serum moisturizer it is not for use around the eyes this contains licorice root extract which contains is an antioxidant that has soothing properties is often found in sensitive reddened skin products
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
4	i like the color as others have said , it 's a true red mine was delivered on a hot day , so a bit too warm when i got it not sure how that will affect the product but on first use , i like the liquidy ness of the polish it applied nicely and easily there is a little bit of shrinkage , but nothing too major if anyone knows how to address the shrinkage issue , please share ! i go back over the tips before curing , but it always seems to draw up to the end of the nail and not cap the end i feel like this leads to premature peeling of the polish my manicure lasts on 7 9 days , not the two weeks many others report and as advertised and i often lose one or two nails in the interim it does look fantastic while it 's on and traditional polish only last about a day before it starts to chip on me , so i'm still happy
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
4	this is a very good shave cream as long as you can get it out of the container this shave cream is thick , smells nice , and is super slippery it rinses cleanly and does not leave your face feeling overly dry i feel like i get a closer shave when using this shaving cream vs other lower end brands my skin is more on the sensitive side and i have had no reaction to this face wash a small dab goes a long way , which means this bottle will last a long time my one gripe with most of billy 's products is the packaging these white bottles are too stiff for a thicker product like this you really need to work to get this product out of the container and its worse as the container gets more empty down near the bottom it is almost impossible to get the rest i cutting it in half and just scooping it out , but i shave in the shower and that may present a problem this could deter me from buying this product in the future
5	absolutely love this polish ! ! ! it stains the nails so be sure to use a good basecoat but love it !
4	i used to use different rose water spray but decided to try this one based on the high reviews it feels nice going on but i do n't think it does anything it feels particularly nice on sunburnt skin i ca n't imagine using it to set my makeup as other reviewers state they do it would just cause my makeup to run off my face
5	this is a great colour goes on a little darker than what it looks like in the bottle , but still a beautiful lavender and of course essie quality , so dries really fast without streaks needs at least 2 coats for it to be opaque though !
5	excellent color ! it literally goes well with any season ! i bought it for the summer but it looks fantastic so i will be wearing this all year long if you have n't tried the essie brand you 're completely missing out !
5	best sunscreen !
3	a very light scent which i enjoy , not overpowering at all it 's so light , in fact , that it does n't last very long at all which may be a good thing depending on your view of fragrance and how strongly you want it to present itself i do not like the bottle cap design , the second time i removed the top , the chrome spray cover came off and leaked everywhere other than that i would recommend this for guys who want a light , fresh scent that wo n't clear a room
5	calvin klein eternity for men has been around for years it 's one of my husband 's favorite cologne 's and mine as well the eternity brand itself is not just made for men , but for women as well , and also comes in a variety of scents however my husband and i still favor the classic it has a warm , musky smell somewhat woodsy and it will last you throughout your day or night with just one application it comes in a standard steel grey box and is a great gift for any occasion , or just for no reason at all i 've always been a huge fan of calvin klein fragrances and this one is top notch would highly recommend to the 's
3	nothing special makes my face wet , that 's about it
5	this is my day moisturizer i love it not to heavy and smells amazing
4	my 17 year old granddaughter tried this eyeliner , as it came in black , which is her desired color choice she said it really worked well on the waterline of her eye , considering that it was a pencil style \( vs liquid \) liner she was also able to smudge the line on the upper lid to her satisfaction , which gave the liner a fade affect , as the original line still stayed dark and true it is definitely great that they include the small sharpener right with the pencil , but i think you probably have to take care while sharpening so that the eyeliner does not break \( it is small and thin , which is great for drawing thin lines , but also makes it more fragile and susceptible to breakage \) i gave this four stars because i think the price is high compared to other brands that work equally as well at a much lower cost so i recommend that consumers shop around to find a better value for their money other than that , it was great and looks beautiful
5	i 've stopped using crest white strips since i got this in addition to whitening , it makes my teeth feel like i 've just had then cleaned at the dentist
2	vincent longo water canvas base takes the saying a little goes a long way a little too seriously this tiny tube of foundation base is not worth 45 00 , not to me anyway yes , it 's creates a nice soft feeling on your skin but it did not help my makeup stay put or minimize pores like other , less expensive bases and primers it actually felt like glycerin which you can pick up anywhere for a fraction of this price i did n't notice any difference in the final look with or without it i was very disappointed and could not imagine ever purchasing or recommending canvas base , not when there are plenty of products available that do the job perfectly
5	best hair oil i 've ever used i use this on towel dried hair and it leaves my hair soft , shiny and nourished i have super long hair and when i use this oil , i never have any split ends or dry ends to my hair a little goes a long way too , so with a bottle this size , i get about 6 months use out of it
3	the lovely thing about this breast ointment is how cleanly it dries it also has a soft , smooth , silicone like texture that is pleasant , and it has no particular scent it does add a bit of comfort , but seems to do little else i can only rate it three stars because i found the size of the product absurd given how quickly it dries and how much you need to use it 's a little larger than an avon hand lotion and it has a pump \( which i like \) if you have breasts of any size you will need to use about 5 pumps to cover your breasts and massage up to your neck according to the instructions unless you have small breasts , you 'll through a tube of this quickly the body lotion does n't dry as quickly and is a little easier to work with
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	love the color of this polish looks very elegant on my nails thick coating
5	love this foundation ! you can barely tell your wearing makeup and it 's easily builds for light to full coverage ! and it 's last all day !
3	i 've been using this product for a few weeks now , and the is that i'm not sure that it 's doing much my eyes still have dark circles under them and look like i'm in the second half of my 40s \( which i am \) but it does absorb quickly , is non irritating \( i 've kept it out of my eyes \) , and does n't take much to cover that small area i 'll keep using it , but if i do n't see better results over time , i wo n't buy it again
5	love this toner keeps skin clear
5	i have used this makeup recently and it is a very nice , consistent product it is a creamy application which spreads and blends easily and provides good coverage to provide a subtle consistency that hides skin imperfections and also moisturizers while offering sun protection this is essential as i burn quickly when i am exposed to outdoor direct light based
4	pleasantly surprised by the calvin klein ck2 ! ! it is both spicy and sweet , great scent for a man though i think i enjoy the smell better on a man , it definitely could be worn by a woman too and she would n't smell masculine for whatever reason , i think this smells totally different on me than it does my husband i found it a little overpowering at first , but it quickly dissipates and has a calm , subtle smell the packaging is lovely ! it is simple , clear and clean i think this is a classic scent that is great in just about any situation it also lasts all day ! my husband still smelled yummy when he got home from work \)
4	jouer is a smooth and easy fingertip application , though i prefer final blending with a foundation brush claims it can be worn on cheeks as a blush or on lips for a bit of color worked best as a blush on my skin type blends nice and sheer shades could easily complement all skin tones i still prefer a mineral powder blush , just seems more natural for my skin but if you prefer a cream blush this is a very good one \( reviewed by my wife \)
4	the cassis noir candle is truly a near black color the flammable warning is pretty funny , considering this is a candle ! i think that was the point , though the smell is quite strong , but pleasant it would be good for a mood smell it is n't quite , but i like it the packaging was entertaining , and i hope this company does well with its entertaining , long lasting , pleasant smelling candles
4	this is a nice little moisturizer for the lips a nice little hint of color i was happy with my purchase
4	i used the product to see if it worked as advertised and it did it kept my skin hydrated and smooth a big plus was that my skin did not break out the ingredients listed in the bottle are rose hips \( rosa canina fruit \) extract , glycol , glycerin , urea i recommend it but the price is a little steep for the quantity it offers
4	obagi is a high quality well known brand that is also touted by alot of dermatologists i 've visited over the years i 've actually used some prescription rx in the past that my gave me to smooth my skin hydroquinone this obagi cream is intended along those lines in a milder form i do find the obagi easy to apply and feels fine on my face no irritation , etc this type of cream is not with sun exposure i typically use it before bed results are good not as effective as prescription hydroquinone but i still see noticeable results of more even clear skin and less irritating to my skin than hydroquinone at current price of 90 this obagi is not cheap but an effective product from a well respected brand 4 star rating by me in consideration of price value
3	this is a thick coverage cream and comes with a special applicator dispenser it definitely needs to be used with a blender sponge for even coverage highly effective at scar coverage and providing a uniform skin look
5	this product works with the gentle cleanser and i like it purchase with the cleanser and follow the directions and get great results
5	gorgeous color , goes on smooth and lasts for two weeks would absolutely buy again and recommend to anyone very happy
3	lanza is my favorite hair product brand , for some reason this product did n't meet my expectations , it leaves your hair really greasy and i did n't see a big difference in my hair
5	i subscribe to julep monthly and have seen this sponge offered in their boxes but never opted in well now i am a total believer ! i keep in the shower and when i work my cleanser into my face i feel so much of a difference the sponge came moist which was a little strange but i believe it 's part of the green tea bit i have been using now for a month love how great my face feels when using this sponge each morning with my daily cleaner i will add to future julep boxes in the future and you can get three great products each month below 22 for to their boxes \( no commitment needed month to month and you build points \)
5	smells amazing ! leaves you feeling very hydrated and it not greasy i spray it in my face , neck , hair , hands , etc
3	between this 3 and the 5 skin brightener , the 5 was more effective and fading the age spots a bit albeit it was the more of the 2 this cream , it did n't smell as bad , but it still left a bad scent as for the effectiveness of either the brightening or the skin dryness , the results were n't that impressive you also have to be careful in the sun as well so i would only use at night overall , i was n't that impressed with this product
5	excellent product my skin is smooth and soft with no dryness i use it over a neocutis serum which seems to work very well
5	what can i add to over 100 glowing reviews which has not been said before \? this cream is pure perfection ! ! ! smooth , silky , need just a little bit to moisturize
5	i'm slowly but surely becoming a baxter of california convert ! i really like the baxter of california night cream aha \( alpha hydroxy acid \) because it goes on thick and velvety , but has absolutely no greasy feel or look , including the next day ! normally when i use a night time facial cream that moisturizes , my face will end up looking like a grease pit in the morning but not with this cream i have combination , oily with dry areas , skin and i occasionally breakout , but experienced no adverse reaction to this cream it left my skin feeling nicely hydrated and soft i do n't have deep wrinkles , but i do have some fine lines on my forehead and in between my eyebrows and after using the baxter of california night cream for nearly a month the lines have softened a bit i'm sure with continued use they 'll be almost non existent this cream , like all other baxter of california products , is supposed to be specifically formulated for men 's skin , which tends to be thicker and oilier than women 's , according to research , and so perhaps that 's why it works better than the average night cream that you find in the drugstores although it 's described as an alpha hydroxy acid cream it wo n't leave you red with burned and peeling skin like a prescription one \( i e retin a \) , so do n't worry about that unless you have the most sensitive of skin you should also wear a sunscreen in the daytime after you start using this cream because aha creams leave the skin ultra sensitive to sunlight and uv rays , and so your skin is more susceptible to getting burned \( even when you 'd normally tan \) i highly recommend this cream to guys of all ages ! although the price might turn some men off you 're really getting a lot for your money because you only need to apply a little bit and it is a fairly large sized tube most men should definitely add products to their hygiene routine , other than soap and shaving cream , so that they can look their best no matter what age they are and baxter of california can help with that pluses safety sealed thick , velvety texture slight scent of soap \( \? \) non greasy large tooth paste size minuses none
5	perfect for covering up the circles under your eyes this gives a generous amount of coverage , getting rid of the darkness easily the coverage goes on smooth without need for a ton of blending keep in mind to go a little bit lighter if you 're using it under your eyes highlights the area so you do n't look dead and the same color everywhere i like the nice dewey look it leaves behind it does not appear to be dry or cakey love it
4	as an 84 year old man , this works very nicely on my skin the scent is not too strong it leaves my face feeling fresh and rejuvenated the price is a bit prohibitive though , especially for those on social security otherwise , i can recommend it highly
5	this is full coverage which was what i had expected and wanted you could sheer this out with a damp sponge for a more natural finish five stars for the foundation what i did n't like were the packaging and sponge the sponge is flimsy and useless the plastic container is rather cheap there was no barrier placed between sponge and product so the sponge will be stained when you take it out of the container none of this took away the five stars because the foundation itself is great
4	i love this color the picture is n't quite the same as the shade it comes out more of a sparkly nude color with a hint of pinkish brown i was disappointed it did n't come out like the picture but i enjoy the shade it did n't cure as
5	cnd is one of the best brand of gel shellac that i have used it will cure using an led light or a uv light i have used both i have tried some of the less expensive brands , but they have caused nail damage , especially the ones that claim not to need a base coat as long as i soak off the cnd gel thoroughly with pure acetone , there have been no issues do not scrape off let the acetone do the work make sure all layers are removed if your nail looks shiny , the base coat has not been completely removed then soak longer when applying the gel , be sure to apply one coat of the base , 2 coats of shellac , one top coat , and cure according to the directions between each coat be sure to seal the edges of each coat or you may get water between the coats and your nail , which may result in a nail fungus if applied properly , it will last 2 weeks i would not advise keeping it on longer than this due to the breakdown of the shellac , and nail exposure to water love this brand well worth the money
5	i like the vinylux more than the shellac it dries quickly , and is much easier to remove the only thing is that the matching vinylux shellac do n't match i tend to like the shellac color more these cnd polishes are terrific ! i 've had artificial nails for 30 years , so i know polish , and this is the best i removed my artificial nails about 6 months ago , and have been using this on my thin , brittle nails my nails have grown out without breaking amazing product !
5	love this as a day cream for my very sensitive dry skin the texture is glorious , so smooth and creamy , absorbs quickly and leaves skin dewy no irritation at all , just soft skin i both love and hate the cap the flip top sucks and i never fully close it because it 's almost impossible to open however , the retractable tube that dispenses the product is awesome and so hygienic i have no idea what their designers were thinking to get it so wrong and so right all at the same time the flip top is the only thing i 'd change i bought 2 additional tubes one for my travel bag and one for the closet so that i 'll never have to go without
3	have acne prone skin and a lot of blackheads and pores it 's hard for me to find a makeup that works aka does n't sink into my skin and can cover my breakouts this makeup deep into my pores making my face look like a hot mess it did cover my breakouts but the cakey feeling was just too much for me i'm bummed because i have other dermablend makeup and have been happy with those
5	great consistency i love essie beautiful color too !
5	my thought when i ordered this was , well , this had better be fantastic or at very least , good after all , the name of this is nuxe relaxing fragrant water being w a t e r if my figuring is correct , the contents weigh 3 3 ounces and it costs 29 00 which puts it at 8 79 1 ounce well , i thought i should look into this a little deeper this is what i found out this 50 year old , parisian company has a 53 year old female as it 's and they manufacture and market face , body and makeup products the company offers cleansers , makeup removers , moisturizers , lip care , masks and scrubs , eye contour , products , first and visible expression lines , deep wrinkle and loss of firmness products , anti imperfection products and re care products for mature skin it also provides moisturizing and nourishing , , and hands and feet products plus bath , shower , dry oils for face , hair and body they make gels for shaving , moisturizing and shower plus eye creams and deodorants for men so , after reading all that , i figured this is worth a shot maybe it will help my wrinkles disappear as they seem to be each day here is my review on this product it smells great , it does make you feel refreshed , it does make you relaxed i am impressed with that so i'm going to give it some more time to see if i do have any negatives and , if i do , i shall upgrade this review right now , it does what it says it does ca n't say that for everything we buy
5	beautiful neon baby pink perfect for those who want something bright but do n't want any loud colors essie never disappoints
2	very smooth texture and compact unfortunately it makes my skin extremely oily and has clogged up my pores
5	it always works for me
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	after i had my baby , i lost a lot of hair \( thanks , hormones \) and had a few sparse spots that made me feel very self conscious my hair dresser recommended this and i love it it 's slightly darker than my natural hair color , but it really does n't seem to make a difference a little goes a long way and makes the parts of my hair look fuller and thicker my hair has since grown back , but i have fine hair so i still use it in places love it !
3	it looks watered down
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	this is my second bottle of this product i bought the first it is the perfect toner for me i have post menopausal acne this works well to down breakouts but leaves my skin smooth it is not drying no discernible scent every other toner i have tried was far too drying on my face i also notice some improvements which is a real bonus i 'll definitely keep using it works very well for me
4	i use this product at home \( i am not professionally , but have 8 years of doing my own gel nails \) so i had the uv light already i initially had a shellac manicure at the local beauty college and really like it \( but not the price \) this system gives , by far , the longest lasting nail polish manicure yes , gels last a lot longer , but i started having a sensitivity to a chemical in the process , so they were n't an option for me anymore this way , i have a longer lasting manicure but also have a little more flexibility in changing colors more often one caveat this does n't really last the 2 3 weeks they tout after a week the from my cuticle is pronounced enough that i want to have a fill \( which i have n't tried yet \) or a re do but during that same week , i have no chips and the color stays very shiny and looking like new
5	my friend had skin cancer and her doctor recommended trying the obaji skin line after a procedure and noticed great healing results and so naturally i tried it and fell in love while living in hawaii , sun protection is important and i have tried an array of sunscreens obagi 's sun shield tint broad spectrum spf 50 provides broad spectrum uva uvb protection , protects against infrared rays , enhances your skins natural undertones , is fragrance free , is light enough for facial coverage without causing pimples or irritation , but has enough oomph to not only give you great protection , but also a tint based coverage so your skin looks awesome ! i am now wearing this in lieu of foundation and my coworkers are asking if i got a procedure done because my skin looks so great love !
4	this is a fairly decent nourishing oil that absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any sticky or oily residue applying a makeup foundation over this is no problem at all it only takes a couple drops to treat the skin of your face , so this 1 ounce bottle should last quite a while the scent is very light and pleasant , but also quickly fades quickly which i a good thing it is worth noting that this is n't a pure rose hip oil , but an extract mixed into a cocktail with other ingredients if you 're looking for a pure oil you 'll want to look elsewhere
4	this is a great curling iron , but it gets blazing hot ! be careful ! be sure you know how to use it and pay attention ! i'm happy with it !
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
5	all is ok thanks
5	i love the mineral foundation and the sun protection !
5	love the color , it 's lighter pink , just how i like it
2	meh not for me a \) the smell is ok but kinda in a way to me b \) i spray some on my hands and go to wipe it in and my hands absorbed most of it lol so i had to use alot more c \) per friends , the ph of my skin is not a good mix with something in here i know for sure that baby lotion \( that johnson n in a pink bottle for instance \) doesnt mesh well it turns my skin smelling to fish no joke ! colognes and lotions i can use , but i have n't the what type of ingredient \( s \) do n't work with the ph of my skin but , fishy moldy musky smell is n't for me n the ladies
5	works fast and really covers the thin spots just be sure you pat it in and give it a spray with the holding spray otherwise it might flake off washes off easily
5	this product line was recommended to me via a medi spa when i had an ipl facial as a 38 year old female with combination acne prone sensitive skin , i was scared to try a product i thought might either make me break out or react negatively i had tried other products in the past from the drug store \( neutrogena \) or beauty counter \( clinique \) , or online \( paula begoun \) all with mixed mediocre results the price was a little steep , but the three week trial kit this came in let me test drive it i used each product in the trial kit as directed after the three weeks had passed , my skin was clearing and managing the retinol very well ! the brightness , tone and texture of my skin improved daily with very visible results ! i decided to invest in all the full size versions of the products in the kit , and though it was pricey , it was completely worthwhile after two months of use , my skin is possibly the best it has ever been i have very minimal to no breakouts i do n't have to wear much makeup at all beyond a little foundation or concealer to even out my color lines by my eyes and mouth are reduced redness is gone old acne scars and discolorations are fading the texture is great i have gotten compliments on my skin lately \( you look healthy are glowing ! look so young ! you ca n't be 38 ! \) i almost wish i had taken before and after photos i cant believe it , but i actually threw out all the other non pca skin care products in my cabinet without hesitation anyway , pca skin is an awesome line it does not disappoint it is gentle yet effective no greasiness or icky perfumes you get what you pay for with pca skin
5	this is really a nice collection of bronzers in a versatile set of colors i say that because my daughter and i are different color tones and we each found a bronzer that worked for us she is porcelain i am tanner right now she looked fabulous in the light shade on the left i used a combination of two , center and left it 's easy to go daytime sunny or evening dark with these powders i used a medium fluffy brush and was careful to not press down to hard i'm not sure i would carry this my purse as the powders are soft wonderful selection will buy when this runs out
4	raw spirit eau de parfum , desert blush comes in a nice bottle which is enclosed in a rose color sleeve enclosed in a white color cardboard box and the bottle sits inside in a crafted exclusively for the protection of the bottle the bottle is glass and the spray are plastic this does look like a product that can be gifted as it has nice presentation to it so how does it smell \? this one starts out with a strong scent that you might have experienced once you enter the ladies macy 's perfume department which is primarily alcohol based after couple of minutes when the alcohol has dried out the smell starts to change and become primarily floral scent a mixture of sandalwood sweet flowers and feels fresh imho the scent is overwhelming at first but slowly fades away to more fresh flowery smell i have used calvin klein eternity for men and while this is an unisex product which is suitable for both men and women this one smells better than eternity for men this one needs to be applied in very small quantity and it does linger for more than 24 hrs after initial application and does smell nicer than eternity when compared the only quibble i have is the spray nozzle does seem little too basic black plastic when compared with rest of the product this is a luxury scent product and has a very rich sophisticated , floral scent ! does smell nice four stars !
4	this little compact is perfect to keep in your bag or purse when all put together it 's about the size of a cd case and just a little bit thicker it can also click together to be about the size of two packs of gum \( like \) put together as for the makeup itself , it goes on incredibly smoothly the colors are pretty neutrals , and will flatter most skin tones except those that are darker \( the bronzer and finish powder would be too light , but the eye shadow , highlighters and lip gloss would still work well \) i am very fair with cool undertones , and these colors worked well for every day use the eye shadows can be layered or applied wet for more depth when using a primer , the shadows still looked good when 5pm rolled around the bronzer and finishing powder section was the best part for me both are matte , and in a bronzer that works for fair skin a matte version can be hard to find i was pleased at how natural both powders looked , and having them with me to do touch up during the day was handy being able to leave the make up bag out of my purse is wonderful the highlighters are just the right amount of oomph not to shimmery at all but provides a nice lift the gloss is n't overly sticky or tacky , but the staying power is n't great , but then again it 's just like most lip glosses even with a lip primer it did n't make it through a cup of coffee it 's a nice addition though over long lasting lipstick the only thing missing from this kit is a little click on mascara and eye liner i have used jouer off and on over the years , mainly off because it is on the pricey side even though it is a really good product another is that it is n't widely sold off of the internet while this kit is small , it does the job quite well if you do n't like packing a full make up bag to tote around or travel a lot , this kit is worth it otherwise , other products will offer a better value for the price
5	i finally used this with a non vinylux color stays on better than other top coats , but not as well with a vinylux color underneath
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
1	i was soo disappointed with this opi product my nail polish chipped worse than if i 'd not used anything at all it did n't seem to work as a base or top coat effectively i was able to get a refund thank goodness at 14 for one tiny bottle !
4	i 've been somewhat reluctant to try really high end creams , feeling like the probably are n't so much better than the drug store varieties , but the l'occitane immortelle precious cream really does leave my face feeling tighter when i apply it there is a light fragrance to it that dissipates almost immediately , but i have to admit that it makes my makeup look better , and even though i still have pretty oily skin , the moisture soaked in quickly and i do n't actually have as much shine as i do when i'm not using it this appears to be a new formulation without parabens , but it does have tetrasodium edta which might some reactions in people with sensitive skin and is a of formaldehyde and sodium , but is also why the product does such a great job penetrating the skin for me , i really liked this product and fully expect to purchase my own when i am through with this bottle
5	bought this for my mother for a holiday gift an she loves the stuff !
5	i saw this color at the salon and knew i had to have it i got a pedicure with it at the salon , and when i applied it on my hands it came out a bit brighter , but i actually like it better like that i used two coats and it looks exactly like the color in the bottle
4	this definitely is a sage color i have many clothes that are sage , so this polish matches perfectly be sure to use the top coat and it will last a minimum of week or more glad i found vinylux because i love having a lasting polish that looks good from the time you put on till the time you take it off
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
3	i have been on a quest for my perfect shampoo and conditioner i bought this set with high hopes unfortunately , they did not work for me i have long , blonde , thick , dry ish hair but this combo made it downright oily and limp i also did not like the scent i do n't normally worry too much about shampoo conditioner fragrance , but this stuff is really strong smelling the conditioner , however , was a bit better than the shampoo in total fairness , i used these products for 2 months but finally threw away the remaining product and replaced with biolage hydrating formula which works much better for me
5	on the whole , being born blonde is a fabulous blessing my only teensy , tiny , wee complaint is that i have super light eyebrows that literally disappear when i have my picture taken with a flash it 's creepy , actually they 're super pale i am talking pale i have used sephora 's eyebrow kit \( which comes with and two blendable shades \) which i love , but this pencil is easier to use and more portable bonus strawberry blondes will be able to use this pencil as it has a very slight reddish tint
4	i am 39 , aa , with oily , acne prone skin i do n't have any wrinkles or fine lines , but i do have dry feet and dry hands i have used this twice at night , but it is too oily for my skin however , i love the way it smells and it has a thick consistency so , onto my feet it goes !
4	the finish is great , it 's just the multiple coating i do n't like , it a lot to keep up i feel like it just builds up on my nail polish but if you 're just concerned about the finish then its perfect
5	this butter brand polish has added to my collection from this brand the colours \( and \) are great the less toxic ingredients are an added bonus !
5	i was real excited to order this product i have always had good looking skin , but as i grow older , i notice dry skin and fine lines developing i like this travel size and received the kit just in time for my trip to hawaii after a week of use , i really like the results the product has a clean fresh smell and is organic as well i really like the way my face feels after i use it it is a great skin product
5	i use this after serums and eye cream it is more of a cosmetic than an anti aging product it works very nicely i was afraid it would be too iridescent and leave the eye area too shiny , but that did not happen it makes skin tone and dark circles look more even toned and helps to hide these imperfections the skin looks tighter and smooth i actually apply it even a little lower than the eye area and a little more out towards the side side of my face because i have hyperpigmentation from sun exposure this really helps to hide it and it does n't look like you have any makeup or anything on your skin your skin just looks better so smooth and more perfected i really like this one similar products that i have tried were too shiny iridescent but this one is perfect it really makes it look like you did contouring and used cosmetics to change the look of your skin , but it does n't actually deposit any color on your skin , so it does n't look like make up is on you at all
5	this hydration cream has a buttery consistency and a floral fragrance that is noticeable after application it is quickly absorbed into the skin , leaving it soft and smooth the ingredients do an excellent job of locking in moisture regular use over months will reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles the jewel like glass jar holds 50 ml or 1 69 oz and has a convenient mirrored cap ingredients aqua \( water \) , glycerin , dimethicone , caprylic capric triglyceride , pentaerythrityl , synthetic wax , butyrospermum parkii butter \( shea butter \) , alcohol denat , hydrogenated polyisobutene , ammonium polyacryldimethyltauramide ammonium polyacryloyldimethyl taurate , pentylene glycol , glyceryl stearate , behenyl alcohol , stearyl dimethicone , glyceryl stearate citrate , sodium hyaluronate , phenoxyethanol , \( carrageenan \) , disodium ethylene peg 15 , disodium edta , caprylyl glycol , citric acid , biosaccharide gum 1 , parfum \( fragrance \)
5	i have purchased the nail polish goes on opaque in 2 coast i use the base and a top i get a lot of compliments all the time ! ! ! the nail polish lasts a long time and i do a lot with my hands as a stay at home mom i have 2 small kids and wash my hands constantly this picture was taken on day 5 on me wearing it as you can see it looks like i just painted them ! ! ! highly recommend
1	it may be an old essie nail polish because it chips and comes off too easily from nails
4	ive tried many moisturizers recently and this has become my favorite i only wish it was scentless even though the smell is minimal and fades soon after applying the product this moisturizer is thicker than most other products ive tried and i like the way it goes on it stays in place and sinks into the skin more thoroughly though , because of its thickness , i know im using more than i have of other creams my only complaint is if it gets too close to my eyes its irritating so im conscious of the need to be vigilant it how close to the eye i apply it
3	this gives good coverage , but it is very liquid and easily squirts out in large amounts i think the container could use some re there is no scent and it does cover imperfections nicely i like that it has a strong sunscreen in it it does have a bit of a cakey look probably not the best choice for mature skin like mine
4	i like the fragrance and was glad to receive both the large and small bottles in this gift set citrus always smells clean and fresh and this lacoste scent is not at all cloying unlike other men 's colognes the packaging is a bit too much as i would have preferred more scent in the bottles and less cardboard for the package but , all in all , i like it
3	i love the color of too taboo but unlike most of the essie nail polish colors i have tried so far this color started to chip rather quickly i put on two coats as it does streak a little when applying the first coat , and also essie 's top coat within 2 days i noticed one nail was starting to chip and in 3 days another one i can usually wear most essie nail polish colors for at least 7 to 9 days with a base and top coat and i put my hands through a lot the color pictured is not as pink it is a deeper pinkish color , not quite a plum though i would wear it for a special occasion but not for the week it is fun but not one of my favorites because it chips so easily
5	it 's an original cnd shellac product as described
3	i love some of the pca products i used to get them from my dr , but found they are much less on amazon this is not my favorite product i do n't feel comfortable putting it near my eyes , it has sort of an antiseptic smell their products with retinol in them are great i also love c quench still looking for a great eye cream
5	i have sensitive , combination , acne prone skin as a result , most sets of skincare products are either irritating , too drying , or too oily for me this set is practically ideal the cleanser is gentle but effective , the toner removes surface oils , and the oil free moisturizer for the toner 's drying effect while leaving the skin matte also , the set is very reasonably priced given the generous quantities involved this is a 3 4 month supply
5	the only dry shampoo worth getting all others are 2 or lower
5	best moisturizer i have ever used skin looks softer and smoother and younger and brighter \)
5	i love this conditioner i have been using it for years and it helps my colored hair to fade less quickly there is a noticeably difference in fade speed when i do n't use this conditioner the smell is amazing and it makes my hair very soft i will be a loyal customer as long as i keep my hair this color
5	she needed green nail polish and thought she might like the color i bought it she got it , and i'm surprised but uses it all the time she loves the color and i may have to buy another now totally worth it to see the expression on her face
5	creates big soft waves \( not tight curls \) you can definitely tell difference in quality of this curling iron from the typical drug store brands great purchase !
5	i would reccomend this product to anyone trying to take care of aging skin i have used this for several years now each 50 ml lasts well over six months i use it nightly
4	i wanted to give this a few weeks before i reviewed it i placed this on my husband 's pillow i felt it would be easier for me to see any differences in his face rather than mine since i see his so much more than my own i did i noticed a brightening in his skin it looked fresher and the color seemed a bit more even my husband did not see it as much there were no changes in the crow 's feet around his eyes though the pillowcase itself is very sleek and soft i think he slept better with it and maybe that is why is skin looks fresher
5	i did n't see and i do n't know about but i love this cleansing creme why \? it leaves my face clean with no hint of residue and my sensitive skin does n't feel any dryer i should start by saying that i'm an older mom with sensitive skin sensitive to various chemicals and allergens and sensitive to being dry my skin can really feel miserable when it 's dry i 've been using this cream and it 's delightful with other cleansers soaps i feel like i need to rinse and rinse not with this vichy product it also leaves my skin feeling very clean without being any dryer than when i began this is marvelous recommend
1	to get thorough coverage with this my face turned white , this is not suitable for wearing anywhere where other people will see you as my husband said , you look like a ghost and you are getting ready to go to a party as a ghost it absorbs well but leaves a white cast on the face due to the zinc oxide it is not greasy i find this unusable rating 1 star hate it
5	would order again !
2	if you are looking at this product because somehow the name implies that it 's and therefore better than say , something with silicone \? it 's not it has silicone i 've used a ton of primers , from cheap to pricey this one falls somewhere towards the lower end of wear for me i have combination skin \( older skin to boot but i use peels \) and this primer made my foundation patchy after a few hours i'm currently wearing lancme 24hr over their lancme branded pro base the lancme foundation slid around on the vincent longo base i normally get about 12 hours of wear out of the lancme otherwise it did feel nice going on , and it smelled pleasant but wear \? did n't do anything good for me
4	since i discovered gel polish and its durability it is my go to for home manicures this top coat unlike other gel nail polish does not require a uv or led lamp to cure although it does say it cures in the sun i tried it both ways drying it out in sunlight and just using my nail dryer and both worked well it is a high shine top coat that gives a nice finished look to your polish it lasts without chipping for about a week which is similar to other gel top coats what i did notice is that it stayed glossy longer and did not get matte like some of my other top coats have in the past , especially after a full week of doing dishes and such overall its a good top coat , particularly if you have a lamp or a looking for your nails to stay glossy throughout the life of your manicure
5	i have dry to very dry facial skin for the most part \( a few oilier patches \) , and i often find that moisturizers either vanish quickly and leave my skin still feeling dry or sit on the surface like crisco the obagi hydrate strikes exactly the right balance for me it has the crisco feel going on , but absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth it has a light fragrance but is not overly medicinal or artificial , and it dissipates once the product is applied recently ive been trying many different moisturizers , as my old standby is n't quite right any more as my skin ages this is the first time ive tried any of the obagi line , and i definitely think ive found my new moisturizer
5	this is a fantastic set ! it lasted over two months i saw results after a week everything is effective my favorite product is the moisturizer it 's light , grease free , and it feels like pure relief when you apply it be aware that the cleanser is very drying , and the peel will burn if you leave it on too long otherwise , this is a fantastic skin care regimen five stars
5	i was introduced to this product on a cruise 3 years ago and have used it ever since ! this is a very high quality product , excellent for sensitive skin
5	i used to use another brand , but the next morning all my head started to scratch , but this one is great new life , back youth \) but the price almost doubled in a day !
5	very emollient , especially in the winter here in the dry feels cool on my red cheeks
4	let me join the this is a well designed brush with an easy to grip handle and soft , pliable bristles that allow you to distribute product lightly or apply more pressure for serious blending it is a large brush , not the largest i own but larger than it looks in the photo , with the bristle area about 2 5 x 1 5 so you will want to use it for applying blush and contouring it will not work for your eyeshadow ! the brush is attractive you can see the japanese aesthetic at work i have read reviews complaining that the bristles tended to fall out i have not seen that problem , and i have tried tugging on the bristles they 're not going anywhere i have n't tried cleaning the brush yet , but as delicate as the bristles feel , the construction seems sturdy the japonesque website states that all their products are cruelty free , but i spent some time searching for the exact materials used and could not find that information anywhere \( that question is even on their website and not answered specifically ! \) apparently the materials are animal but since the brush is made in china , you may indeed wonder about the of the bristles for that , i deduct a star and will not be likely to more of these in the future if that does n't bother you , this is a great addition to your collection
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	very pretty good quality polish that is easy to use looks as pretty as a french mani highly recommended if you are in a hurry or do n't want to pay for a salon white tip mani skip the tips and use this
5	i ended up using this for awhile figuring it may help with some lines i 've had around my eyes for some time now and make my skin feel more alive lucky for me i think it does work \( although i wish i did before and after shots to compare \) my skin lines seem a bit lighter to me and my skin feels in areas i applied it one word of warning a little goes a long way given the price of this you should really make sure you do n't use too much and waste any it 's a really nice serum and one i 'd suggest others try out
5	my sultra iron and i have been on a long journey together we recently had our 5th anniversary together that right there shows you the quality of the build of this iron that this unit is built to last the black ceramic of the iron is durable and easy to clean , so no matter how much hairspray gets all over it , it 's easy to get off with a clean washcloth \( when it 's and cold of course ! \) mine came with a pink glove which was lost ago as i stopped using it i found that it caused my hair to be more frizzy and harder to curl in the long run than being a bit more and delicate while handling the iron i typically use the point the iron down with your opposite hand method and just have the teeny tiny end of my hair that ends up this is kind of good anyway since the type of curl you want with this iron is more of a beach you wave instead of a curl depending on how you hold the hair on the iron and for how long will decide how the curls look wrapping like a flat ribbon of hair gives more of a traditional curl look , while wrapping the strand of hair in a spiral and then around the wand will give more of a mermaid look the best part about this iron is that it will curl almost any type of hair , even the most pin straight even my asian girlfriends approve and bought their own i got this as a gift back in 2010 before there were 200 curling wands on the market and before the tapered wands seemed to be the size and style of choice but the extra money for this model is so worth it i 've used my sister 's tapered model and it does n't look the same hair does n't naturally get more curly at the bottom so that seems odd to me plus the curl did n't hold , with this model i literally have curls until my next wash 2 days later now that there are multiple sizes of this iron it 's harder to choose 1 inch is a great one size fits all model 3 4 is great for tighter curls and shorter hair , and the 1 5 is better for really long haired gals who want beach waves and those girls who have easy to curl hair and only want a loose wave keep in mind all curls drop so do n't get this one if you have medium length hair , it wo n't make a lot of difference but this is the curler for those girls who thought they were destined to be straight haired their entire life it is a miracle worker ! !
1	photos two weeks ago and today i honestly think a full 30 to 45 days every day will achieve the best results , after that period of time manufacturers suggest use three or four times weekly it 's very important to start with a clean face ! i 've noticed a degree of improvement in fine lines and wrinkles but mostly i 've see results in the tone of my skin and a major reduction in my pores which was almost ridiculously noticeable after three day it 's become an easy part of my morning ritual and really requires little time , but it is important to follow the instructions on handling and swiping \( there is a correct way to move the nuface using it incorrectly will not bring about the results you want ! \) it really is a magic wand when used regularly anything that can add some tone and firmness to aging skin \( 55 \) is appreciated and worth it i also used or aloe vera gel \( you want a moderate amount , not , not generous \) since it was much less expensive than their product update 4 months later the device has stopped working , which is unacceptable ! will attempt to contact customer service and if successful will add an update update customer service contacted me via email and gave me a list of instructions to follow to continually charge the device for 16 hours \( if i had not been charging it regularly \) until the light no longer moved on the device etc i followed the instructions and the nuface still does not work i went to down load the return form to return the device \( i will have to pay for shipping \) but since i have no proof of purchase i ca n't just send it to them \? last laugh on a free product review did love it while it was working but so glad i did n't pay for it !
3	one tiny capsule covers my entire face it smells nice and goes on smooth , without much residue left behind on my hand however , after a couple weeks of use , i really do n't see much difference it 's a nice moisturizer , i do n't know that i 'd spend this money on something that does n't have lasting results
5	frankly i had no high hopes with this product and thought it would be similar to other brands like chi color wow is much different , it 's a white colored styling cream , looks and feels the same as any thick face cream it 's very easy to apply and not at all sticky i have long and thick hair and use only a small drop size cream when first applied to may hair , i did n't see any difference but the moment i started using my hair straightener , i could see the amazing results my hair were straight in no time and looked and felt silky it did n't add any shine though i definitely recommend the product , it has already become one of my favorite and reliable beauty products
5	does the trick
2	i love mustela products \( generally speaking \) but this cream 's scent is far too strong for a product intended for sensitive skin i ca n't really speak to the long term performance of this product because i simply could n't get past the scent and did n't want to use it on my little one a may be in order if mustela wants a better seller on their hands
5	i do wish there was a way to tell when there is sparkle in a product this does have a little sparkle in it , but is a pretty color
2	packaged in a two part dispenser that reminded me of the dual dispensers in my husband 's shop two chemicals are dispensed at the same time and in the correct proportions for the product to work as it should elemis skin energising , day cream may do everything the manufacturer claims it will if the dispenser actually worked once i was able to open the extremely secure top , when i pumped it twice as directed i got a nice amount of cream but the oil component down the side of the bottle because i was never able to get any oil into my hand to mix with the cream component , i used the cream alone it made my skin feel soft and smooth and it was an excellent base for my makeup elemis needs to make significant improvements in the dispenser in which they are packaging this day cream if they do not , regardless of how well the day cream works when mixed in the proper proportions , as currently packaged and dispensed the price of this product is not justified
2	this la roche posay toleriane teint mattifying mousse foundation went on very smoothly it was a nice color that i believe could work with several different skin tints the problem was that it rolled up or up on my skin i hope i'm explaining it right i thought maybe i had put on too much moisturizer , so i started over with less moisturizer that did n't help the mousse would bead up not stay smooth on my skin i'm not sure why , but i just did n't work out for me
5	spritzer that works good just spritz a layer after 15 minutes of exposure and keep getting spf 15 but you have to wait 10 minutes for spf to set into the skin and protect you supposed to spray 30 minutes before going into sun exposure better way is to spritz on skin , then , wear a thin outfit over the skin when you need to get sun tan and bath in sunlight , expose for 15 minutes \( that 's all you need per day to get sun tan to change skin pigment \) and walk back inside you got vitamin d and some sun tan pigment any more you will start to get sun damage and skin will sun burn
5	this is a great cream to use for dry skin , i use the 1 and this along with it for quite some time definately recommend to anyone who has super sensitive skin , or any skin type other than oily ! !
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
4	as far as lip glosses go , this one is a lot less stickier than others i have tried the test is when the wind blows your hair on your lips with some glosses , the hair gets really stuck and then when you remove it , you have lip gloss on your hair with this julep brand , hair would still stick to it , but it would n't feel like glue and would not coat my hair i know , kind of gross , but that 's how it is it has a pretty good smell and does n't taste awful it says it is paraben and sulfate free , and the company claims it does not test on animals it still has a long list of chemical names in its ingredient list , all of course by the fda and such that should make you feel warm and cozy it is hard to find lip products that are not full of things i would rather not i think the product looks good on , this is a subtle color , i am over 50 \( barely \) , and did n't think it looked awful or that it around my lips it is nice overall , but i think i would stick with glosses where the first ingredients \( hydrogenated polyisobutene , pentaerythrityl , butylene ethylene copolymer \) are not chemical derivatives
5	i much prefer eye lining pencils over all the powders and paint on varieties that have come out in recent years call me old fashioned if you 're like me , and have owned a few dozen different brands over the decades , then you 'll understand the frustration of finding a great liner , only to have the wood shaft of the pencil when you sharpen it cheap wood the bane of pencils of all varieties when i opened the cap on this liner i was delighted to see a very tight grained light colored wood i to sharpen it right away i used a basic sharpener and ca n't tell you the happiness i felt to shave the thinnest curls of wood off the pencil this is made possible by the tight grain of the premium wood they encased this lovely liner inside not by an extraordinary blade and the liner \? shade 01 is the deepest pitch black i 've seen in a very long time the pigment is super saturated so your lines are consistent from beginning to end it goes on very smoothly and it resists smudging and moisture for hours it comes off when you take it off with sharpening you can create a super fine tip for the thinnest lines , or you can use it the way it comes for a medium width line the color is even and lasts all day without problem i'm addicted and buying the other color too i love it added jan 24 , 2015 so i bought color 2 not really knowing what color to expect i was n't sure from the pictures if it was brown or a shade of grey it is definitely not brown it 's a dark grey or a lighter black than 1 the quality is just as good and the grain is just as tight on the wood 2 is a better shade for my fair complexion i continue to be impressed by the long wearing quality of this eyeliner
3	no big problems with this other than not really being impressed i like longo products but these pearls mean nothing it 's just a gold liner it applies fine but does take a bit of time to dry \( expect smudging for a few seconds \) i used primer with it and without primer and each time it took awhile to set the color is pretty but on it goes on more than than i expected
5	i first saw the em palette as a special offer on ipsy i was interested in it , but it was priced more than i wanted to spend i was thrilled to see this as an amazon daily deal recently , so i it i 've been using the this make up palette daily since it arrived there is a great variety of colors a lot of them are natural and subtle which is what i prefer i have been impressed with how long the color lasts i apply my make up in the morning before going to work i often notice that by lunch time it hardly looks like i have any make up on at all i 've been able to tell that it 's still there \( in a good way \) well into the afternoon i do have to reapply after work if i have plans out , but that is pretty normal anyway i love using some of the colors as my eyeliner i tend to rub my eyes a lot , so the powder does n't last as long there , but the eye shadows and blush are good for most of the day
3	as fragrance is different on every individual 's skin , i can only say that i think that nuxe is ok , but it 's not a fragrance that i would enjoy wearing , and i did wear it twice before writing this review what i did like about the product was the spray which diffused the scent evenly
2	ugh the minute i opened this i got a strong whiff of fragrance what is it with these manufacturers that they add potentially irritating scent to their products i do not want to smell like my face cream nor do i want to risk breakouts the cream seemed to go on well but so do others and at the price point it is not a good value fragrance , high price , decent moisture but not the best i will take a pass on this product
5	i like the feeling of the case
5	there are so many studies that say the stuff in the antiperspirants really are not good for you so we try to use them as little as possible this is a cool to the skin , lightly scented gel deodorant it is not an antiperspirant ! some people have remarked that they still get damp when using this well you will with any deodorant ! it stops odor without an overpowering scent that to others all day long i really liked that it is not overpowering you really ca n't smell it unless you are very close to the person wearing it i got this for my 22 year old son and he really likes it , i , \( mom \) however personally love the scent and am going to get one for me ! i know there are times when you need an antiperspirant but it is nice to give your body a rest from the antiperspirants when you have light days that you know you wo n't be yourself much where a deodorant will do for a change
5	we just returned from florida i took eltamd sunscreens we used enjoyed all of them the tint in this product makes it wonderful no heavy coverage which is perfect for fl summertime ! i wore this to dinner eating al one evening it worked beautifully this one is going into my arsenal i 'll re order when it runs out
4	the smooth indulgence redness green concealer is a nice product that reduces redness the only issue i had is that it slides around easily until it dries i also noticed that it did n't last all day
5	the best ever took care of the problem completely our dandruff was over the top are falling from the top constantly now , there is none use three times per week
5	this is obagi hydrate on steroids ! i use the regular hydrate cream in the morning and put the hydrate luxe on at night i have fair , rosacea prone skin and just love this stuff i also use the obagi serum c 15 in the morning before applying hydrate cream and throw on the glo minerals makeup for a totally hydrated and soft skin
5	nice
4	okay , i have purchased several obagi products for my mom , she really likes the obagi products up until now , i have n't tried it for myself because i find these sunscreen lotion to be overpriced \( i am male \) so now that i have tried this , i really like the feel of the lotion , it does n't feel heavy and the spf 35 is nice for skin protection i will use this product , but i still find it a bit too pricey for my taste for me to repurchase
2	i bought this mascara because i recently read a beauty book that described blinc kiss mascara as after giving it a week , i am tossing it out my eyelashes look small and thin and actually like i am wearing no mascara when this product is applied two coats you say \? after the first coat , my lashes feel hard and sticky two coats ca n't happen i , too , was worried that my eyelashes were falling out when i washed my face at night , but it 's just the falling off tiny at that also , while i have never had any problem with any beauty product in the past , and i am closer to fifty years old than any other , i have irritated eyes since wearing this mascara my eyes feel gunky and watery , almost like there 's an allergy overall , i completely dislike this product
5	i have skin that gets dry , oily , and flaky easily , even washing my face thoroughly daily so , it 's great for that but i also bought it for shaving maintenance i use this about once a week and it works great
3	it did moisturize , and vanished without a greasy feel i did not notice any whitening yet after 45 days i am using it on some skin spots i have and there is no difference it may work better on plain old age spots though i had found more affordable that worked better it is well packaged , and arrived in a very hot time of year and still was in good shape when i brought it in thats a big plus since half the creams i get are not sealed tightly and have leaked everywhere
4	the first thing that hit me when i opened this jar was the cloying smell of rotting fruit \( garnier has the same smell \) the cream itself is light green and very light weight almost whipped it sinks in quickly , i only need a little , and my skin loves it ! i just wish it smelled better
5	this color is so beautiful and perfect remind me of a vintage blue once you paint it on your nails i loved how it was shipped fast and bubble wrapped will definitely order from them again !
5	great set , at a cost the product sizes are ample enough to provide several weeks of application to determine if these products are right for you i have sensitive and dry skin , but after using my vichy 3 piece set for several days now , i am already experiencing a more youthful , hydrated , and smoother feel to my skin and , i love the fact that it is dermatologist recommended the set comes in a decorative tin container making it a wonderful gift for family or friend
4	i love this spray but i'm not exactly sure what it 's for it smells amazing ! i have tried to set my makeup with it as it says you can do on the bottle and not sure how well it actually works as a makeup setter i think it also makes me break out \( but most things do \) overall , it smells amazing and is very refreshing
5	this product works with the gentle cleanser and i like it purchase with the cleanser and follow the directions and get great results
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	giving these are stocking stuffers
5	love this and have recommended this to all my friends it is so effective ! definitely my ca n't live without product in my medicine cabinet
5	i'm a bit when it comes to my skin my pores , for the most part , are perfect except for around my nose area now i 've been told they are n't that large but compared to the rest of my pores they are and i 've hated that i have a long and excessive skin care routine and nothing seemed to refine them away this product was the exception i rarely give skin care products 5 star reviews but this one really impressed me it did n't work overnight by any means , but after about a week of use i noticed a huge difference and now my pores are all barely visible very good product if you have stubborn pores that just wo n't reduce in size this is definitely worth a try
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
5	great color
1	i bought 2 of these and i'm very disappointed these cost the full price of an essie polish so i expected it to be authentic these are watered down fakes i wish amazon would do a better job of regulating this stuff \(
2	made my hair look dirty and filmy not very attractive on
5	i have used alot of liners in my lifetime and this is fantastic the colors are great and very , so i bought every color ladies if you are sick of what your using now , then get off your and order a couple of these you know would never steer you wrong oh and if your hand is not quite steady , do n't worry it goes on almost by itself
4	i 've been buying butter london nail polishes for a few years and have always loved them , and have been happy to see that they 've branched into creating makeup now , too this mascara creates a nice , dark , glossy color , and i really like the volume it gives the unusual brush shape takes some getting used to if , like me , you 're used to a more conventional mascara wand after using this for a few days , though , i got the hang of it it 's a bit tricky to use on your bottom lashes , but still coats those well while this is billed as a volumizing mascara , it also does add some length , without weighing down your lashes my current favorite mascara is buxom lash , and this is comparable in terms of giving a natural look to your eyes that is not too dramatic for daytime wear the formula also has n't irritated my eyes , which water quite a bit because of allergies , and does n't bleed when they 've become overall , i really like this !
5	this is a lovely tinted moisture lotion i am using the golden color and it makes my facial skin look so pretty it really adds a golden glow without looking oily or too shiny it 's easy to apply and it lasts all day this has spf 20 and also includes vitamin e , ginseng and gingko biloba all anti oxidants which are used to help our skin stay healthy and young looking it goes on light and covers well if i want a little extra coverage somewhere , i will wait a bit and then reapply a little more to any problem area i have and it works well
5	it is useful as it described
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	the best feature of this body wash is the lovely scent , which is intense enough to enjoy while you wash and lingers very little after the shower \( i'm sure you could layer with other la source product if you want lasting smell , but i do n't expect a wash to leave me perfumed \) this is a fresh , oceanic scent , and while i usually gravitate towards light fruity and floral scents i do like it quite a bit i associate crabtree evelyn with feminine scents \( except for their men 's line , \) but this scent and packaging could pass as gender neutral in my opinion this seems to clean as well as any other body wash , and i 've observed neither irritation nor noticeable improvement in my skin compared to using previous washes because it lathers well and the relatively small bottle opening allows for control over the amount dispensed , this should last well for the size of the container
5	this powder is amazing keeps my foundation smooth and long lasting use a smaller , softer brush for applications otherwise you will waste a lot of it using a thick brush
1	the brush is splayed out so i ca n't really use it just seems like cheap bristles or something \?
5	very nice mild facial cleanser even for my very sensitive skin makes this a winner i followed the directions on the bottle and my skin felt soft and refreshed , not tight or irritated i realize everyone 's situation is different , but i think that for most people this would be a natural
4	i'm not very makeup capable i wear it every day and have my regular routine , but never make any day to night changes and do n't do anything different for special occasions i typically wear an almay bronzer that i love , but was excited to try this butter bronzer for a more contoured , special look the shades are a little darker than my usual bronzer and give me a more glow y look , which i love i also really love the glow highlighting pen , though mine was a little crumbly and it seemed like some of it was being wasted the compact is awesome with a really nice mirror perfect to throw in your bag ! if you 're planning to wear this all day , you may need to reapply a bit since it 's a powder , but i thought it still looked pretty good by the end of the day i'm happy i finally have something that makes me feel a little fancier for a night out i'm hoping this lasts a while because i 'll definitely be wanting more when i run out !
4	it has a great although i do prefer the exfoliating cleaners
5	my stylist told me about toppik when she noticed how thin my hair was getting to be she purchased the 0 36oz 10 3g for me from the local beauty supply even with her discount it was almost 25 but i really liked how toppik camouflages my thin spots only a couple of people have noticed that there is something different with my hair only one person realized what the difference was , and only because she 'd also used toppik toppik is now a must have product for me so i started looking for a better bargain and found it here i get almost more than twice the product for only a few more i would definitely recommend toppik to anyone
4	this brush head is a little more gentle on the skin , but still gives a nice deep clean and keeps pores clear skin is soft and smooth as always with using the clarisonic
4	i have never been a huge scrub fan that 's the way it is always made me feel weird always afraid of getting stuff in my eyes or other places with the body scrubs , so they 've often been a turn off for me this winter me with some major dry , bumpy t zone skin , so i gave in and tried this it 's not bad it is gritty , but not too abrasive feeling and has a pleasant odor it does work , so that 's the big thing i'm not sure i'm still won over as a regular scrub user , but for when i get that nasty skin , i 'd dig it out
5	this moisturizer is awesome it 's light and not as thick as my sunscreen this product helps against damaging rays from the sun while keeping my face feeling moisturized i love it ! i use it day and night
5	awesome product
5	this very light body lotion has an ultra light , clean scent that will not compete with your cologne it leaves behind no greasy feel , and it is quickly absorbed into the skin it is perfect for use in the warmer months of the year , when a heavy duty cream is not necessary it helps smooth work weary hands and feet the pump bottle makes it easy to use and readily available
4	i have very dry skin my go to product is whipped shea butter or the really hard , waxy 100 cocoa butters you get at farmer 's markets i do n't like the format of the latter product since it requires a bit of warming before it 's supple enough to apply to one 's skin whipped shea butter is clearly superior , however , i was looking for something that came in a pump form enter this body cream i have noticed a real difference in the moisture level of my skin it 's far less dry for longer periods of time i feel as though shea butter absorbs better , but it 's definitely waxier than this product i like that this lotion does n't feel greasy overall , it 's sure helping my skin in this very cold , dry winter weather
5	it 's not cheap , but it does work i 've been using this serum for about a year now and can attest that it keeps my skin clearer and smoother than anything i 've ever used , period i rarely , if ever , have to use any kind of pimple cream now good thing is that a little goes a long way and a bottle can last for a couple of months use it after a good cleanser and then follow up with a good moisturizer and you 'll be set
5	love this will never be without
1	the gel burnt under my eyes it got slightly swollen under there as well use with caution
5	my skin is certainly not menopausal , but i wanted to give this lotion a try , as many products that i have tried have not helped my skin feel moisturized and well treated i began using this lotion about five weeks ago , and although i realize five weeks is not that long of a window for me to make a solid , i am impressed with the results i have observed so far first , my faint face discoloration \( one of my skin issues \) is still present , but i have noticed a slight evenness improvement in the tone of my skin these results may be minimal , but i am satisfied so far also , although this moisturizer is a day cream , i also use it at night , and i cannot get over how soft my skin feels after each use which is a reason i do not mind that this cream does not include spf i love how lightweight the lotion feels after application , which was initially surprising because the cream feels thick upon touching it , but how it absorbs into my skin tells me this cream is gentle during application the cream is not greasy and has no strong scent , but it does smell fresh and pleasant thus far , i really love this moisturizer previously , i was using an all natural brand , which is what i prefer using , but unfortunately , despite its promising results , i had to switch to another brand since having the opportunity to test the vichy line out , i am impressed the price is worth the investment the bottom line is that this lotion treats my skin fairly and leaves it feeling smooth
4	this sunscreen has a nice tint to it which i like because i can wear it alone and apply it after during swimming and not look naked faced it has a high spf to protect and works well so far fragrance free and made for sensitive skin , this has no ill effects on me at all applies smoothly and keeps my skin feeling soft very happy with this
5	love this curling iron ! this size is just perfect , not too big where it does n't do much and not so small that i look like temple i love the long cord and its very good quality it gets hot fast and stay hot , i keep it at a temperature of around 300 maybe to 330 and thats plenty hot for my hair i also appreciate that the cord moves as you use the iron so it does not get tangled overall its very good quality , makes the perfect curl , and i love how i can control the temperature and that its not just a low and high setting
5	gorgeous mid tone blue , very bright ! finish is shiny and multi colored , like in mother of pearl \( just like in by zoya \) application is easy , opaque in 1 coat , wears really well without chipping for a week with base and top coat
5	awesome product love all davines products and will continue to purchase them
3	i 've used this 3 times have n't noticed much accept that it 's easier to extract my clogged pores once i wipe it off ! i 'll keep using it as directed to see if longer use truly makes a difference update this review so it 's fair
4	this blush is a pretty pink peach shade it has a light sheen to it , but not glittery it does n't take much to add a little glow to my complexion , just be careful not to apply too much the case it comes in is really pretty too i wish the description would give more information on the shade instead of no 3 because picture and actual product are different recommended
4	silver powder review best product i have found for my very difficult skin i had all but given up but was impressed with the service and the cleanser and decided to give this a try thank you
5	i 've been fortunate enough now to try a few different dermablend products and it 's made me a believer in their formulas i wish i had found these in college and my early 20 's when my cystic acne was out of control thankfully these days my skin has calmed down , but i still like medium to full coverage foundation for evening wear i expected to like this product the least of everything i 've tried from dermablend since my skin naturally leans a bit more dry and i 've always thought of dry skin and powder foundation as being less than ideal but actually , i quite like this of all the products i 've found this one is the easiest to vary the coverage with a brush i can get lighter coverage for daytime wear or switch to a sponge for more coverage despite being a powder it is n't itchy and does n't seem to accentuate pores or fine lines it makes me wish dermablend had a product for lighter coverage because i very much like their formulas and range of shades would recommend
5	this color is simply adorable ! i receive compliments after compliments whenever i wear this nail polish i must order more soon nice fall color
5	i am new to this line of skincare and am absolutely hooked ! every product i 've purchased is gentle and seemingly effective with a great price ! i 've begun to switch to this line as my other products run out i'm a very happy customer this product is wonderful for my sometimes dry skin
4	a great neutral smelling hair gel that is not sticky to apply to wet hair the only is that it is not that strong when applied to wet hair , but was better when applied to dry hair i did n't have to use much when applying to dry hair and it did not leave the hair sticky at all worked well with heat , i use a hair straightener and that it seemed to style the hair better you kinda have to play with it with the different way finish your hair styling adn particularly hair style , for sure
5	i have used dermablend for many years i used to sell it and i loved to teach other how to apply it for the most effective coverage warm saffron has always been my favorite powder and i am glad to see that it is still offered
3	pros this moisturizer absorbs into the skin better than any moisturizer i have ever tried i have dry skin that is prone to looking shiny oily on the surface some moisturizers make it worse if they just sit on top of the skin even later in the day , my skin felt moisturized but did not get shiny after applying this in the morning cons it smells exactly like lemon pledge while not entirely unpleasant , i would not choose to smell like a coffee table the container it comes in is annoying you have no idea how much is left and you have to it open to get the last bit out lastly , 65 00 month is way more than i want to pay for moisturizer i got a deal on it the first time but could n't find it cheaper after that so i had to stop using it
4	now that i have tried mineral sunscreen there is no going back to the traditional formulas this goes on smooth and leaves no residue or sunscreen smell the only drawback is that the tint is only in one color i have applied it alone and it is fine for a beach day where makeup color matching does not have to be perfect but for daily use i like a more exact color match i mixed this with my foundation but had two issues first i cannot put enough into the mix to be sure that i am getting the necessary sun protection and second it changes the tint and consistency of the foundation i have finally found that works for my skin tone additionally , it the color of my costly matched foundation which already has spf this tinted mineral foundation will be used for outdoor activities when i am my regular make up routine it does not run into my eyes and goes on smoothly i would love an array of tints to select one to match my skin tone
3	this stick does n't cover as well as i would like without turning cakey nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href dermablend crme foundation makeup dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 dermablend crme foundation makeup a nbsp works better for full coverage
5	i honestly did not expect the polish to be so sheer \( 4 coats required to be opaque yet still not bright \) i recommend painting your nails white then putting about 2 coats of this polish on thanks so much !
4	i use this as a blush not much as a
5	love all the pca products i have purchased ! i can see a difference within a few weeks of starting to use it the prices seem to have gone up on some products since my last purchase a bit pricey
5	this is seriously my favorite hair product it nourishes your hair without making it greasy at all it protects it from the heat , and makes hair soft and shiny , without weighing it down it keeps my hair from getting dry or split ends i recommend this for oily or dry hair ! it soaks quickly into the hair without leaving residue it is honestly the best , i 'll keep buying it for years to come i recommended this to my mom and now she loves it too i have nothing but good things to say ! ! it even smells good ! i'm really excited , can you tell \? \) it is a little pricey , but i think it 's worth every penny i also use this as moisturizer for my skin too , and it soaks in leaving skin so soft , no residue , and supposedly fights fine lines and wrinkles i love this !
5	fun color
1	my wife used this , she said it 's smooth , nice smell she did not notice any reduction in wrinkles when i told her that they are asking 74 00 per ounce she laughed out loud she said she would never purchase a cream at that price i agree with her for the product itself , 4 or 5 stars given the price , 1 star rating
5	the first impression is very wow , this box seems tiny to actually have enough to actually do anything but it turns out that it 's only meant to hold enough for a couple of rounds of use , and it does that well my skin is feeling good so far , and now that i know it works i like the idea that i could toss it into a bag very easily to take it on a trip , or keep a couple extra boxes around without having to worry about it much !
4	i have n't used a bronzer in many years because i felt that it made me look somewhat brassy and was sort of awkward on my skin tone i have fair to olive skin , brown hair and eyes considering my complexion it gives me a natural glow without looking orange so , i think that impression was mostly in my head i was a little hesitant at first because i had seen some of the reviews about it looking orange or being too shimmery however , once i put it on , it looked like i had a soft , natural tan i liked it from day one so it works well for me and is not too orange or brassy id describe it as warm and gold copper tone a little goes a long way one thing i love most about it is that the staying power is great i 've not had a problem with smudging , smearing , etc like ive had with other bronzers and some makeup ive used it for 30 days and it barely looks like i have used any i could see this lasting me for more than a year over the last 30 days ive not had any reactions or breakouts so i should be good for the remainder of the package the package is very cool looking and handy to carry but is difficult to open at times not fun when you are trying to reapply while out and about it comes with a brush but i prefer my own most of the time i use the one included when i am traveling inside the brush is well shaped to apply and contour but prefer one easier to handle unless i am traveling overall i would recommend the product
5	this is a deep reddish purple color , really lovely , and unusual not sure what else to say , but need these extra words to post \)
4	super easy mud mask applying the mask requires peeling off both sides of the plastic first i removed the white plastic side and pressed the mud lightly on center line of my face , then i peeled off the clear plastic side which allowed me to press the cloth mud onto my face both sides need to be removed to get good application there does seem to be a trick to application and i will get better with each application smartmud felt cooling the entire time it was on my face and was still wet after the 10 minute wait i peeled the mud off tossed it into the trash can and only had to gently rinse to get the remaining mud off my face i plan to use these for girls spa night next month and i am sure it will be a hit
2	contrary to some other reviews it was very orange it 's too bad because the scent is nice i'm going back to lancome 's flash bronzer
5	aaa
5	this brand is my go to line quality products and my skin feels wonderful
3	i am always looking for a good eyeliner since my favorite one by the body shop was discontinued i had high hopes for this one , but will keep looking pros 1 the color is great it 's not too light and not too dark 2 i have had no irritation when using it at all 3 it goes on nice and smooth no your eyeballs needed ! cons 1 it comes off way too easily after about 30 minutes , it is all but gone and needs to be reapplied if they could fix this issue , i 'd give it five stars as it is , it is pretty much useless
4	my husband and i are both avid , and the chlorine just about does our hair in we both used this , on his short hair and my long hair , even though this is a men 's brand both of us were happy no tangles and there was a fullness when we rinsed it out that was n't there before when dry , our hair felt silky and soft and both of us commented on how much less brittle it felt after the pool it 's good stuff , but two things of note it has a strong mint smell \( similar to aveda 's rosemary mint shampoo \) which put me off a bit as it with my fragrance the other thing was the extremely tiny printed instructions that i simply could not read it was n't so much they were small but the font was awkward shaped with a blue background that made it impossible to read maybe i need to buy some or something but if you are interested in knowing ingredients and details , good luck with that this is hard to read !
2	i simply can not get past the heavy furniture polish smell of this cream i 've been using it for about a month and see no difference in my skin , aside from the fact that it 's much greasier after application i'm 43 with dry but fairly healthy skin and only started using a dedicated face cream this year \( previously used olive or other oils , with the occasional eye cream my mom would give me , maybe as a hint \? \) my regular cream is kiehl 's ultra , which made a noticeable difference in my skin within a week i seldom wear makeup other than mascara , so i expect a face cream to do most of the heavy lifting for my appearance , and i'm doing nothing to change the effect or appearance of cream once it 's on my skin i switched to this to road test it and was very excited to try such a fancy miracle cream unfortunately , the heavy lemon pledge scent was impossible to ignore , and the greasy feel and look turned me off even more the best thing i can say about this cream is that a little goes a long way a month of twice daily use barely put a dent in it i 'd estimate that it easily goes 2 3x as far as the 's if i had liked it , it would have definitely helped the additional expense \( ounce for ounce , this is 4 as expensive as my usual , depending on the size jar \) but i did n't like it besides the heavy scent , the cream is very greasy and was slow to absorb , even into my dry skin i did n't like the shiny , greasy appearance on my face , and it did nothing to improve my fine lines to make the odor and feel worthwhile in fact , the greasy look seemed to accentuate them , especially around my eyes maybe it takes longer than a month to have any effect , but i'm not willing to keep suffering it to find out it did n't irritate out my skin , which does tend to be sensitive , and i liked that it did not include sunscreen \( usually the irritating culprit \) because it 's so expensive , i 'll keep it around and try it again in the winter and see if it 's less offensive in cold , dry weather but for summer use , i kind of hate it , but i'm giving it 2 stars because it goes so far and does n't irritate my skin
5	love essie 's nail colors this is a perfect color of red not to bright but very soft had a hard time finding it in stores thanks to a amazon you can find anything
4	this was pretty good it was fairly irritating after application , but nothing horrible the amount in the tube is very small two applications , i 'd say maybe more if you just do little areas that makes it fairly expensive
5	my wife been here in us for 4 years and she had no skin problems until about three months after her arrival ive taken her to several dermatologists including a private doctor who refuses insurance the private doctor is far better than all the others put together , but my wifes skin just starts coming off of her index finger on her right hand \( primarily \) and nothing seems to prevent it and we cannot understand what triggers it either she was only 24 years old when this started and now she is 28 , almost 29 i will include some photos to show how bad it gets and in only two days from almost well we have tried all kinds of expensive prescription and over the counter eczema lotions so even though this says it is for babies , ill try it anything she wears gloves and i do all the dishes myself she has special hand soap and body soap , but she stopped the soap and now only mustela cleaning cream previously it kept cycling between almost well and unbelievably bad if she anything hard , he skin can split open and bleed she never had any issue whatsoever before her arrival here in the united states , of all places i am beginning to believe the word eczema is short for i have n't got a clue whats wrong eczema seems to be a term for dermatologists one dermatologist actually diagnosed it from 12 feet away while holding onto the to rush to the next patient \( \) in two whole minutes at most his nurse looked at it and that was good enough for him so to pay so much money to a as a doctor said nothing could be done it is permanent anyway , i get this mustela stelatopia cleansing cream to try on my wifes fingers she tried it for several days and saw some improvement after about 4 days my wife says the aroma is not that great , but she has a remarkably sensitive nose seems fine to me she says it feels smooth in her hands when washing her hands with this mustela cleansing cream she was amazed because she has tried many eczema lotions and cleansing products , but with zero success she wanted to use it a few weeks before i wrote this review weve seen several false starts already seems to work well for a while or it healed naturally , then eventually just neutral , no better and no worse not so with mustela stelatopia cleansing cream for eczema it actually does something controlled experiment i know this is marketed for babies , but it doesnt matter as long as it improves my wifes skin even a little she 's a baby compared to my age after washing her hands with only mustela stelatopia cleansing cream for eczema , her hands do not feel dry it seems lotion softens and is absorbed into her skin im not going to say she is cured she but its quite an improvement , so we will take whatever i can get it is still improving , so it 's not over yet so with that said , i can recommend this for those people who have eczema problems , not only for babies , but for adults as well skin is skin except for normal aging looking back on my own long life , i can see how i abused my skin , but i did stay out of sunlight after getting off of the farm people routinely assume i am 15 to 20 years younger than i am i 've had to show my id to get a senior discount on a bank account for age 55 i was a lot older do n't frown , squint , smoke , drink and stay out of sunlight it truly works and i'm proof if i had not been born on a farm in central texas , i 'd look even younger it is cumulative i have uploaded the photos where her hands condition is so terrible and the very worst after using mustela it never gets as bad anymore it still happens , as you can see in the last two photos we forgot to take photos of when it is average or best she is not in that stage right this moment , so i will upload the more typical case later we still have to visit more dermatologists and so more research ahead to understand what triggers it something clearly appears to start it we will take mustela stelatopia cleansing cream for eczema with us on her next scheduled dermatologist appointment to show the doctor the ingredients maybe the doctor will know a prescription strength lotion or something to aid in her recovery or maintain a better typical case there are many things we continue to try , but mustela stelatopia cleansing cream for eczema is the only thing that we can specifically state improves her skin condition photo order first 2 photos before \( really bad , but not unusual \) and the last two photos after using mustela stelatopia cleansing cream for eczema a few weeks it is still in an improvement stage still early so i will post more photos as we go the last two photos are the worst it gets now it looks almost healed in between times we forgot to take those photos because we were imagining it would stay healed it 's a slow road , but at least i believe she is on a road to recovery now before there was no path to follow
5	i have been buying this for several years i have very fine hair and it give me the body and life i love
5	best cleanser on the market
5	this is one of my favorite colors from essie i have been looking for a pale pink nail color for awhile and pink glove service is just perfect ! you have to paint at least two coats before you can see an obvious difference , as it is so sheer perfect for a french manicure as well as just wearing by itself i 've gotten many compliments on it \)
4	just what expected
5	good
5	thanks
2	i love the color like linen but it 's super runny i 've put on four coats and it still is n't a solid color on my nails
3	jane iredale lip pencils break easily and have to be ground down quite a bit each time they need to be sharpened i have found this to be true of every lip pencil i have bought in this line of cosmetics for that reason , the lip pencils are way over priced you lose half the product when they continually break and need to be sharpened by losing several layers in each sharpening not worth it
5	i really like this scent on my husband and smell both the woodsy and citrus notes he probably would n't wear cologne at all if not for me , so it 's important that it 's not overwhelming of the few bottles of cologne that i 've given him , this boucheron is the one he send to prefer most
4	maybe i am totally nuts but i just applied a sample of needles no more and i swear the wrinkly forehead lines appear less pronounced i realize this is a temporary fix \( a few hours \) i think i'm fairly when it comes to skin care and silly claims , but this might be a good trick for those times you need to look your best however , sadly this product was not enough for dr brandt himself expensive , would need a few more tries before to an actual purchase other reviewers are much less impressed than me , perhaps their expectations were too high and mine to low but i am intrigued
3	this lipstick went on well , felt good going on , and lives up to the hydrating claim , but it did n't last as long as expected my one real complain is the color the color \( as viewed on my computer which i know can vary \) looks like a rich pinkish plum color , but when i wore it it was much more vibrant and hot pinkish and had more of a matte finish instead of a sheen or gloss i generally buy colors similar to whitney so it was a bit of a shock and disappointment when trying this one on i guess i also assumed that since it was hydrating that it would have a subtle sheen to it not necessarily a gloss but not a matte either i do n't think i 'll be getting lipstick online again because there are just too many color variations
5	very pretty color ! love cnd products , great quality , great selection !
2	i use several of jane iredale products and have been happy with them this was the first time i tried this under eye concealer for me , not that great not as much coverage as you might like the brush applicator feels nice but you really need your finger to put it on light coverage and i felt it was more of a under eye highlighter than to be used for coverage
3	it gives instant fuller hair image , look like a of dark dust on the scalp if look close , many people asked me what 's on my scalp , kinda awkward it will be washed off if you submerge head in the pool , regular shampoo wash is enough for this product
5	you can spray your face with rose water for 7 , need i say more \? great for an afternoon makeup refresh , for hydrating at night or in the morning , or just to feel fancy when you 're at home in your and one of my most favorite products ever !
5	i always use wax when i say always , i mean ever since the product hit the market i tried as a teen , but the noxious odor and the spotty results had me seeking other solutions so , when i ordered this , i did have that old fear nonetheless , i am happy to report that this product is genuinely outstanding ! foremost , there is that signature odor , but it is not nearly as strong as some others secondly , the spatula type applicator makes the product fairly easy however , i tried multiple times to evenly distribute the product and it always ended up a little so , when i was completely done , i use a finger to smooth the product \( and then quickly washed \) i followed the directions and used a washcloth to remove the product \( i waited six minutes instead of the five indicated do not go over ten \) it wiped off 100 clean not 80 , not 90 , not 96 i mean 100 what \? ! moreover , i have extremely sensitive skin and , while i was fine with the patch test , i was nervous about a larger usage i experienced zero redness no negative reaction whatsoever to be honest , this probably will not replace waxing for me the results do not last long enough however , when i am in a rush , this will be an excellent second place highly recommended !
5	excellent color ! it literally goes well with any season ! i bought it for the summer but it looks fantastic so i will be wearing this all year long if you have n't tried the essie brand you 're completely missing out !
5	good head camo
3	perfumes are hard to review since everyone 's preferences are different i am sure everyone has sat next to someone with an overpowering perfume and thought too much i do n't think anyone will find this overpowering , but it is a very sweet scent this product does have lasting power i put some on in the morning , and could still notice it when i went to be and laid my arm near my face it is not my favorite , but since everyone 's body chemistry is different you may love it
5	i had n't used eye liner in a long time , so i thought i 'd give this jillian dempsey one a try and i really like it ! it goes on smoothly and has a sponge tip on one end , making it easy to get the smudged , smokey look great product !
5	subtle fragrance works well it 's hard to find a deodorant stick that does n't leave underarms sticky this is just perfect
5	i'm 48 with a history \( thankful it 's in my past now \) of hormonal chin acne and i have fair amount of dark circles under my eyes i have an olive completion i went looking for a hard core concealer and found this been using it ever since i use sand beige mixed with some color quick fix it covers very well i will say that the quick fix is not as thick and is applied alot easier than the cover creme though the coverage is not as good i would suggest that you first moisturize well before applying under the eyes for a smoother spread i use mine under mineral powder and it works great it 's waterproof and has as your other make up wears off this stuff stays on so a good color match is a must i highly recommend this product
2	i love the idea of all natural products however i do not like the applicator the eyeliner seems nice , velvety and smooth with a very nice deep black color but it 's by the fact that i ca n't master this very tiny wispy brush applicator if you 're used to a velvet type applicator this may be tough for you to master
4	i love that this product does not have any carcinogens in it i quit using nail polish for years because my nails were always terrible about three days after when i removed the nail polish this nail polish is so light pink that ir was as if i was just adding shine so it matches my nails before using the polish i have had tearing , and breaking nails since i was a kid i have tried a clear product before that was supposed to help but it did n't improve my nails at all for me , this product makes a very good clear nail polish if it does actually improve my nail strength after a couple weeks of use , i will come back and up date this review one thing that i noticed is that there is still the bad chemical smell when the bottle is open and you are applying it i would love it if there was some way of getting rid of that
1	below average moisturizer ! how can they get away with false advertising \? if i could get my money back i would !
5	works as described used on gels and regular polishes some took more drops than others , but this bottle will last me a long time
4	i was looking for a cheaper alternative than josie maran argan oil and took a risk on this it smells divine like a combination of flowers and nuts the consistency is good too only negative is it contains bht preservative i try to avoid update after using entire bottle the scent became too much for me will not purchase again
5	extremely nice cleaner i do n't have heavy acne , but i do get occasional areas that come and go after using this cleanser , i noticed all my acne getting much and better it does n't completely prevent an occasional one here and there , but for the most part , it keeps most of the outbreaks it 's perfect for my neck , where i 've been having acne since getting much older feels nice and clean , and does n't burn my skin
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
3	polish seemed old dried a much darker color dissappointed
4	this is n't exactly a high retinol product , but its efficacy still remains impressive and for that i am grateful the moisture is wonderful , the cream feels pretty good on skin , and a little goes a long way i like the list of ingredients and the clarity and firmness it gives my skin after only a couple use i use it as a night cream and have been pleased with the results intense repair \? i'm not sure in that category but it 's a fine , fine treatment just the same
5	you will not catch me without applying this on my face and neck everyday this product block 99 if not all of the in my opinion i do n't see any sun damage to my face when i started using this product i hope the company will continue to make this as i cannot live without this anymore \( keep up the good work there !
3	love the color ! the polish goes on kind of clumpy for a brand new polish that is the only negative and why i am not giving it a 5 star i'm a little disappointed with that , because i absolutely love this color and thought essie was the brand to get ! !
4	this smells nice and does make my hair shiny a little guess a long way i have dinner hair and have to be careful or it looks oily dirty and weighed down it smells nice
5	the air in southern california is dry and , hence , that makes for dry skin lotions and creams sometimes are just not enough replenix pure hydration hyaluronic acid is powerhouse product binding water to your skin for round the clock moisture and hydration in the evening , i use a glycolix 20 pad \( makers of this product \) after cleansing to remove any remaining dirt and dead skin then , with wet hands , apply 2 3 drops of the serum in the palms of my hands and massage into my face and neck for several minutes till it is all covered and absorbed it hydrates immediately and all night long you can definitely see a difference after just one use , and , greater improvement with continued use one bottle , if used this way last two months so it is a great value is an outstanding company of superior products many of which pair well or stack with others you would expect to pay double for triple for a lesser product in a dermatologist or plastic surgeon 's office for sure , a part of my daily grooming routine
5	it was worth every penny
4	i really like dermablend products , and this concealer goes on nice and easy , but it does not cover age spots it made my two look lighter , but you could still see them in all fairness , the directions say to use powder after using the concealer , which i did not do still , i'm very happy to have this concealer for possible future problems , and am really glad to have discovered dermablend products they are costly , compare do the usual drugstore cosmetics i buy , but they go on well , stay on well , and look natural
5	when we are younger we often get tattoos but once we enter the work force we can no longer have a tattoo they are permanent so unless you want to spend a lot of money you are stuck with a tattoo and wearing long sleeves what do you do \? try hiding it with make up ! dermablend quick fix body foundation stick works it goes on easy and it works ! it comes in several colors
4	this is one of our favorites so far it is not pasty and applies evenly and consistently this is a very good shade for 3 women in our family this compares slightly better \( in our opinion \) to mac though the mac line seems to provide slightly better coverage depending on skin type overall , we like this foundation
4	i have used dry shampoo for a long time my favorite brand was discontinued so i 've been trying different brands i like this product the best but either i got a defective bottle or the design is horrible i could n't get it to work , but that was n't a problem because i use another bottle for my dry shampoo usually anyway
4	love it thanks amazon for carrying this product
4	it was hard deciding between 3 and 4 stars i did n't like the scent and it made my elbows itch i love the mitt , and the effect i have medium olive skin , and it did go brown instead of orange or bronze this is truer to the color i turn when i get sun than other tanners it absorbs very quickly and does n't stain clothing
1	while i was placing a few orders on amazon my friend asked if i could order her the trial size vichy since she does n't have prime long story short when i took it out of the padded envelope the top was not only cracked but also it was completely off this was n't sealed and most of the product was in the envelope ! threw it away and will not repurchase
5	and quite simply , she does too she recommended it , but i really do actually like it for myself its not overpowering like i ca n't breathe let me out of this elevator right now and its not too light like i wonder what that old lady with the flowery perfume was doing in this elevator its strong , bold and crisp and she really likes it so there 's no loss there ever
5	awesome fall color ! ! ! !
5	i was looking a finish like this for a long time it 's just what i want ! ! ! little bit pink and transparent
4	i'm a committed user and mix the strivectinlabs high performance booster oil with my serum to apply the oil has a lemon scent that i may be added to cover up a more chemically smell which it mostly does for oil , it certainly does n't make my face greasy in the slightest it is hard to explain but it does have a mild firming effect the closet example i can think of is the way a thin , gel facial mask feels but way less the mask feeling lasts , pretty much all day as for my fine lines and wrinkles no impact there but very well might be if i wore foundation and powder which i do n't
3	the picture shows it kind of pinkish , at least on my screen i knew it would n't be the exact color pictured all products differ at least slightly from the picture but it 's really a pale brown color instead of anything even along the pink spectrum i 'll still wear it , but i was really hoping for a neutral pink color , and instead i got a brown that wo n't match much of what i wear i'm rather upset that it is n't what i expected , and i really do n't much like the color
3	hampton sun sunless tanning mist gives great color i'm naturally very pale , so i was afraid this tanning mist would make me too dark it did n't it gave my legs subtle color that definitely was more golden brown tan than orange which is a win in my book ! but while i loved the color , the application process was n't so smooth i 've only used cream sunless tanners in the past , so maybe some of my difficulty comes from being a spray tan newbie in any case , i had a very difficult time actually spraying the mist onto my legs it was like the nozzle did n't work quite right i had to push very hard to get anything to come out , and it ended up going on in spurts it was impossible to spray evenly i used my hands to smooth it out , but , once the mist had cured for several hours , i saw that my legs were very streaky and blotchy i followed the directions to the letter , applying to clean , dry skin , and not putting on clothes until my legs were completely dry , but i still had less than stellar results \( in fact , i stepped outside wearing running shorts , took one look at my legs , and went back into the house for jeans i was embarrassed by the streaks on my legs , which definitely fake tan ! \) the next day , i applied more , this time focusing on the streaky blotchy parts , and once that had set for several hours , my legs looked at least presentable i'm going to keep trying , but i 'll probably go back to the cream lotions once this can runs out
3	this cream is a little too thick for me to want to use regularly maybe in the of winter i could imagine needing this much moisture , but on a normal day it just left my skin feeling sticky and greasy , which makes this one a no go for me , personally , a \( still barely \) 41 year old with slightly sensitive skin after just two days of use i had a few unusual breakouts on my chin and nose , so i stopped using it i also was n't a big fan of the fragrance which was extremely strong , and perfume like i prefer my moisturizers neutral my final knock is that this does n't have sunscreen and , since we should all be wearing that every day \( probably the thing that does the most to prevent wrinkles and other skin damage \) , i really prefer a moisturizer to include something so essential as thick and greasy as this is , really ca n't adding another layer of lotion cream to get needed spf
5	i ca n't say how much i love this product ! i use it every morning instead of using lipstick instead of drying out my lips , it makes them moist and fresh looking
5	i love the eye pencil , but the price blows me away it feels good , looks nice , helps keep my lipstick from bleeding into those old lady wrinkles
3	over all it is good but i feel it kinda scratching my hair it does n't go as smooth as the titanium model i returned and get the same size with the titanium model
4	this is some of the best ! it goes on so smooth and gives me the coverage i need i highly recommend it !
5	perfect shampoo with a nice fragrance that really makes your hair feel clean i work at my roots mainly then use the left over suds for the ends this pairs nicely with my davines i wash my hair every other day
1	absolutely no moisture for my curly frizzy unmanageable hair the detangler was a waste as well
4	in these photos obagi nu derm zinc sunscreen lotion \( z formula \) is on the left , and is on the right the difference is that obagi has a more oily appearance , while is a matte finish the obagi sunscreen tends to catch into and highlight skin lines , while disappears easier with some rubbing i just wish this were not so expensive , since it is a rather tiny bottle in that respect the obagi product is a better value this one is nicer cosmetically
5	this butter london true to form clutch bronzer is an excellent set of bronzers i love the three colors and the gold highlighter pen is a true bonus i never used bronzers much before this , but these have completely changed my mind since i am black , i do n't always go for collections that do n't have a target color audience , but these colors are versatile enough for most people to be able to use them the case is also nice and very well made it is n't like the flimsy ones that will break easily the mirror is a good size , so you can apply it anywhere the makeup is n't gritty and powdery , so application is flawless i am very pleased and i will be checking out more products from this company
5	wonderful neutral color
5	if you have ever seen the show with , this is the exact nail polish her beauty artists used for the tv show \) it 's absolutely gorgeous ! long lasting ! i used butter london tops and with it
5	fun color
4	this is a light moisturizer that soaks into my skin quickly and easily no detectable smell for this price i expected more i have n't seen any difference in my face as of yet , but its only been about a week
4	i put my feet through a lot of stress this summer i walked a trail half and between my regular walking and my long walks training , my feet needed some tlc plus winter will be here before i 'd like to think about it and my feet get really dry then this foot cream felt lovely it is thicker than most hand cream and i massaged my feet until it fully absorbed there is a scent which might bother me if this were hand cream , but my feet are far enough away and i always wear socks so i had no issues with the scent
5	so glad i found this now that i have gone gray i do n't have to worry about my pink scalp showing after styling my hair , i shake it lightly on exposed scalp areas and it stays there until i wash it out easy to use and i 've been using the same small bottle since july bought a second for my travel bag totally recommend this product
5	the obagi360 line is great , its a 3 step system , however i only have the exfoliating wash and the this hydrafactor moisturizing sunscreen this is my style of facial regiment , just wash and moisturize with spf i have used this sunscreen a couple of days now , there has n't much sun in california lately but i like how the sunscreen feels on my face it feels very light and it give my skin a nice glow my face is naturally oily , but after a good wash , it feels good to apply this product great product , this is marketed for people 20s 30s , but i believe this can work for everyone
5	excellent product i applied 2 coats without any polish so i could see how long the shine lasts well , it 's been 4 days and my nails are as glossy as the day i applied this base coat it also has n't chipped or worn off the edges like the other top coat i use , which i re apply every day this is definitely a time saver since i only have to apply it once a week my nails have also not chipped or broken since i started using this product which is quite a feat this time of year with all the baking , cleaning and that goes on i'm interested in trying this brands top coat if it performs as well as the base coat , my home mani 's will last a lot longer
5	i love the silky smooth lasting feel this skin serum leaves my face feeling , even hours after applying my face still feels and looks terrific i see a notable difference in my skin , it looks more alive without dryness and the wrinkles around my eyes are disappearing as the weeks go by using this on a daily basis i know the cost seems high but using the tinny amount it takes to cover my face daily i know i have at least a 6 month supply and with the results i'm seeing its well worth it to me i'm amazed how far just a little amount of this serum covers my face , this bottle will last me a long time
5	this is a great curler , love it very much works amazing , the cord does n't get tangled , and much more this has been another great buy from amazon
3	i received a box of tiny samples of very expensive products the only reason i am not upset is the price of the box , 19 99 is towards the purchase of one of the items in a full size most of the items are 50 i realize these are luxury beauty samples , if you are a buyer of luxury beauty items this might be something you would enjoy for me , not a good deal
5	i bought this for my sister who loves nail polish it arrived very quickly and she was so happy with the color she gets compliments on it all the time , and like other essie polishes , it does n't chip easily
1	did nothing
5	i really like this brush firstly , it comes in an attractive little box then , actually need to put it together its aluminum casing is very light but seems to take a bit of a beating since i have dropped it a few times with no damage at all the brush itself is soft enough to not irritate my face but rough enough to pick up the beard i do n't know if this brush is better than others since this is my first , but if there is one better , i cant see how
5	this is a great product
5	i have used the sunless cream from this company and it is incredible ! when it read med dark , i was scared it would be too much for my very fair skin i also was nervous about it being a mouse i have used mouse products before and they never apply evenly to my skin i was happily surprised at how well this applied and it did not have one streak in it ! the best thing about their products , they smell great and also they do not stain ! i expected them to stain my clothes or bedding but there was nothing on either if you are looking for a sunless tan that works , this is for you !
4	i have used several body lotions over the years st ives , lubriderm , jergens , vaseline , and a few other brands all of them vary slightly in terms of moisturizing the skin and the fragrance this lotion is very moisturizing and the fragrance lasts longer than i expected my wife and i have very dry skin and this lotion felt great in addition to providing moisture , it reduces skin dryness the quality of the lotion is good but this is certainly a high end product !
5	very nice product i love that it is made from real strawberry seeds it makes my skin feel really good without over scrubbing it or drying it out another mario badesco product to add to our collection
5	i actually came across this sort of accidentally see , i was removing some dark red nail polish from my fingernails , and it left behind this really awesome pinkish hue no , i did not use a base coat , and yes , i do realize the pinkish hue was a stain but this got me thinking i would pay for this look i had no idea if i could replicate it , and it was a little uneven so i thought , would n't it be great if there was a nail polish that could give me the same effect \? ! turns out , there is it 's essie 's pink glove service i ordered it a couple days ago , received it today , and put it on my nails are adorable they look so natural and feminine ! i would recommend this to anyone looking for a classic , elegant look for their natural nails \)
5	i just love this face wash ! i noticed a difference after the first time i used it and after only a few days my skin is noticeably clearer i use this for both my face and body and i can proudly say that i am about 90 acne free the remaining 10 of my acne is a lot less severe that in used to and i think it will clear our in the near future this was is gentle and perfect for sensitive skin my only complaint is that it does little to fight blackheads so i pair it up with a face scrub \( neutrogena \) and a pore minimizing serum \( art naturals \) the other essential part of my beauty regiment is biotin this supplement does wonders for your hair , skin and nails
4	both my husband and i have used this product for a few weeks now , so i could see how it works for our different skin yes , i know it says for men but , despite the set 's insert explaining that men have thicker , oilier skin that needs non lady like care , i think skin is skin neither of us have had our skin magically transformed by this , but it seems to be a fairly high quality product the wash is slightly drying on my combination skin , but works well on my husband 's the toner i'm still not sold on exactly what toner does close the pores \? restore ph balance \? anyway , this toner smells like medicine \( think \) and i ca n't tell a difference when i use it or skip it the lotion is fantastic as i 've gotten older , my t zone has gotten worse \( more oily \) and this does a great job of restoring moisture without being heavy or greasy looking super bonus it is totally unscented score downsides i contacted the company to ask a simple question that should have had a canned response , and never heard back , so they may not be the most customer service oriented folks the products also contain parabens , so if you avoid those , these are a no go
2	i had a hard time opening this and when i finally did the top of the cream pencil got stuck to the inside of the cap and completely got pulled free of the main tube i managed to stuff it back in and got my hands covered in color for my troubles really bad packaging at least the color seems nice
4	it was a gift and there are no complaints
4	way more transparent than i thought pretty color with fine glitter it 's nice as a tint of color need 3 4 coats for opaqueness
4	i use shaving soap and a brush for daily shaves , but packing that stuff for a flight is a pain i leave the tube in my travel shaving kit and it works based on the other \( rave \) reviews here , i may try to use it more on a daily basis to see how it goes definitely a great cream for the price
5	great polish and received a lot sooner than estimated , very satisfied !
5	love this blowdryer ! i am very particular about my hair products i have thin but a lot of hair and lots of highlights bra strap length and i bought the version ceramic babyliss which i did n't like at all but i actually bought this from a salon spent about 35 more then amazon 's price wish i had seen it here but it is definitely a salon grade professional dryer and leaves hair feeling like salon hair the ionic is the best ! i would rather spend the extra money and know i'm getting the best which hopefully will last longer than the that burns out both your hair and it 's working ability ! amazing italian professional blowdryer it really does make a difference in your hair and styling ! my hairdresser advised to invest in a professional ionic dryer and i'm so happy i ! worth the money ! totally recommend and will stick with this dryer forever ! ! hair will stay healthy and if you want the salon results a professional dryer is really a necessity ! !
5	while i would not call this a classic like drakkar noir , , etc , it still is quite good i doubt anyone would hate it but i think very few would be ecstatic about it
5	i love essie because of it 's staying power it lasts for more than one week and this color was rockin' i received many compliments on the color
3	this is a pretty nice shower oil , but the scent is very strong reminds me of de suntan lotion , that we used when i was a kid it works okay , has a bit of shimmer but the scent is very strong
5	ca n't beat opi polish and ca n't beat the price on amazon ! a winning combination for me
4	this was n't what i expected it is a thick foundation like cream that did not leave a chalky look on my fair skin that others complained about it just looked like i was wearing a thick foundation if my skin was worse than it is i would appreciate the coverage , but as it is i normally can get by with a bb cream and the heavier coverage was more than i wanted i have been wearing it as a sunscreen i have to say that for the price i prefer nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href eltamd uv clear spf 46 48 gram 1 7 oz dp b002msn3qq ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 eltamd uv clear spf 46 , 48 gram 1 7 oz a nbsp it provides a relatively sheer coverage with good sun protection both products are easy on my very sensitive skin i do n't expect to buy more of this
5	this is a great travel sized shower gel that works as both shampoo and soap \( although it is soap free , so not sure how that works \) its pretty small i actually thought it was hair gel at first , since it is the exact same size and shape as my regular hair gel for regular , daily use it is too small and would require regular replacement , but it is perfect for taking to the gym or throwing into a suitcase
5	love this
3	i'm a vichy fan but this is the first product that i ca n't rave about when i see peel i'm hoping for that satisfying feeling of peeling it off this creamy gel like mask has a light , pleasant fragrance , goes on easily and evenly , but it never dries enough to truly peel i left it on for double the recommended time but it was still tacky i massaged it off with damp fingers which took some effort so i'm sure it exfoliated my skin the instructions are only printed on the box not on the jar so read the box before you toss it the vichy usa website does n't even have this product on it to you ca n't get instructions there my skin felt smooth and refreshed after use but it did n't give me the peel i was hoping for i know that it is supposed to be an acid based peel so not necessarily the pull it off in one piece peel , but it still left me feeling underwhelmed i followed it with vichy 's aqualia thermal mineral water gel which is a fabulous product
3	i have the shade yummy mummy and while the color is beautiful and the formula applied nicely , it only lasted four days on my nails before chipping significantly i was really disappointed because i had such high hopes for this popular brand and considering the price visit my blog at christinaschiccorner com to read my more detailed review i posted about it as well as pictures of what it looked like on my nails
4	i have no use for the plumper the exfoliator was dry i liked the effect of the texture for exfoliating
5	this is my new signature fall polish ! ! love this color ! it looks black , but in the light there is some shiny wine undertones
4	i 've been using this for about two weeks now and overall think its a good product as moisturizers go it 's a good one and i really like the fact that it does n't smell and goes on really smoothly without any greasy or tacky residue the spf is a bit low for me for everyday use and i do consider that a flaw the packaging is nice and the container is pretty robust overall a really good product
5	this is such a great gift for the man in your life it 's a bit pricey , but much like some of the fancy bubble baths , lotions and perfumes that we so love , this shaving cream is top notch and actually a treat to use my husband loved the simple , but manly scent \( no strong smell but there \) he loved how easy his shaving experience was he usually uses the more expensive bottled and moisturizing shaving cream , but this one really made for a smooth shave with zero irritation , zero pulling and zero little nicks quality it 's very thick , so you add some water to it and it lathers up nicely honestly , i am thinking this little tube will actually last twice as long as normal shaving cream , so it 's honestly not that much more expensive in the long run even though it seems like it up front
5	this is a very small bottle \( think travel sizes \) but thankfully a little goes a long way like other mario badescu products , the liquid looks thick but feels smooth and non greasy once you rub it into your skin the best part is that it has spf 15 , which means i can use this as sunscreen , not just moisturizer spf 15 is good for everyday use , when you do n't expect to be exposed to a lot of heat and sunshine , but you still want something to protect your face when you go out for work or casual walks i appreciate the fact that it does n't have a strong scent except for the price \( which i think is a little high for a small bottle \) , i like the feel of it on my skin
3	i got these polishes for a great deal and was so excited to receive them but i am finding out that the wear time was n't that great and for the price of these polishes its a little , lee started to chip within an hour of me wearing and that 's with base coat and a good layer of top coat
5	holy smokes ! this very well might be my new favorite essie color ! ! ! literally the most gorgeous shade of blue ever ! and you really only need one coat to get total coverage just plain beautiful and i 've received so many complements on it it just pops !
5	great color and quite nice to look at
4	recommended by my dermatologist like that it is not thick you do have to shake to combine ingredients takes very little for my face and neck like all sunscreens , keep away from your eyes
5	i was sent this bronzer in matte tan and golden glow i like the golden glow a lot better because the color is darker and it shows up better on my skin i have a medium skin tone also , this bronzer has a bit of shimmer , like my favorite bronzers do it gives the skin a healthy glow without looking like a disco ball i have been using this product for a few days , now , brushing it on my forehead , along the hairline area and under the cheekbones to breathe life back into my skin after applying foundation the powder is high quality and up to the high standards i have for lorac products i have added a picture showing the color of this bronzer compared to my favorite bronzer , too faced sun bunny as you can see , the color shows up nicely , just like sun bunny lorac bronze glow is the lighter color , too faced sun bunny is slightly darker overall , this bronzer is good for women with light skin to medium skin i know that the bronzer looks really shimmery in the swatch , but when you apply it with a brush , it looks a lot more natural as for packaging , the bronzer is too bulky the package is about double the thickness of the packaging used by other companies , e g too faced or mac i wish the packaging were slimmer the bronzer comes with a brush that is good for contouring , but given the shimmer , this is n't really a bronzer you 'd want to contour with i think it 's a good brush for matte bronzers , but i prefer to use a fluffy brush for this one there is also a nice sized mirror at the bottom of the compact just remove the sticker on the bottom to make the mirror usable i would have preferred the mirror to have been placed under the cover
3	first of all , let me say that proraso is good quality stuff i gave this 3 stars because imho , it does n't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes i have a tube of proraso , but wanted to try this , and the razor glides much better with the cream and i get a much better shave also , from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap , a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather , and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather i did this and it does work well , but that makes it a 2 step process which i do n't want to do i 'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush , then do the lather in a shaving bowl and for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream , it 's kind of in between it 's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap , but it 's definitely not a cream it 's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand , put it back in the bowl , and you would n't need to wipe any residue off your hand
5	i love this cleanser ! ! ! i was nervous to use any blemish type of product because i know they are super drying luckily i 've never had to deal with acne before , but i recently broke out could n't get it under control i started using this cleanser , and about a week later i noticed a huge difference my skin is back to normal ! it never got dry or flaky or anything , and a month later i have n't had any breakouts big bonus , it smells good too \)
4	i was kind of expecting this product to have some grit to it , but it doesnt its smooth it has a very light fragrance , which is not overpowering at all its very creamy and doesnt leave my skin dried out after cleansing though i can sometimes have problems with cleansers causing skin irritation \( even having to seek medical attention \) , i have n't had any issues with this one the only thing i really do n't like is the packaging a screw cap bottle is not the way to go it probably would have been best to use a tube for this product ill have to keep the bottle turned upside down to be able to get it out
5	product quality 5 stars product value 5 stars packaging 5 starts \( though , note that it contains no brush \) sandalwood color only 4 stars i found this to be a lovely quality blush and an excellent value very happy with the product quality , though i would have preferred a pinker color \( i received this free to review so i was n't able to choose my own color \) i have the sandalwood , which is a bit more of an orange ish apricot shade than the photo implies it is not actually orange , just a warmer , less pink color the photo seems to contain a smidge more pink than the actual product i will definitely re order , but i will choose a pinker shade \( perhaps the blossom or rose \) this color is very wearable , but wo n't complement the pinker lip colors i usually prefer the product is actually excellent it is intensely pigmented \( this is a good thing you need little product to complete your look \) one swipe on the product , one swipe on the cheek , and you have a lovely amount of color this is also a large product pan , so i expect this to last you at least a year the finish is very natural especially when used with a good brush i think this is the best blush i have ever used there is no brush included , which i prefer \( who uses those teeny brushes usually packaged with \? \) , but that detail is work noting also the compact is sleek and opens easily \( after the first time anyway \) and stays closed when closed i like the sleep black i completely recommend this
4	best shave ever ! ! better than my electric razor by far great for the price and it gets the job done and then some
5	i have been using revision products for about 10 years and love the brand this cream works well and i am never without it
5	we have three massive make up cases just for cosplay and , since i have been the designated make up person for the last five years i can tell you that nothing beats dermablend you can buy cheaper but you 'll end up layering three times as much product and it will not appear even remotely natural you simply cannot buy better ! this foundation is perfect since it allows me to easily cover any blemishes my subject may have as well as any birthmarks beauty marks and , what i really love is how once i have a clean canvas \( one perfectly created by dermablend \) , i can layer over regular make up \( or more extreme cosplay make up \) without pilling , rolling , or smudging i cannot say any other brand is as forgiving as dermablend finally , dermablend lasts until you remove it we have used this for full days of photo shoots and panels and it just stays put ! dermblend is dermatologist recommended and works like a dream please , do not be put off by the price a little goes a long way for most everyone i have used dermblend for years ! it is the best , bar none !
4	this serum works a little bit nothing revolutionary , but a little bit is definitely better than nothing for fine lines i had assumed it was a moisturizer , but it 's not you apply it after cleansing and before moisturizing the texture is a runny gel a bit thicker than water , but not much \( e g , lighter than any lotions \) i sometimes have sensitive skin but this did n't bother me at all , and after a few days my forehead lines looked a tiny bit better , though the ones on my cheeks and near my eyes looked about the same i love that it 's all natural , so i do n't have to worry as much about side effects you might see with long term use of , pegs , tea , dea , pesticides , artificial dyes , fragrances , etc i 'd probably keep using it , but for the current price of 52 bottle \( and fairly tiny size it does n't seem like it will last more than a month or two \) , i do n't know that i can justify it just for a tiny bit of reduction in fine lines i suggest also checking out andalou brand products , which are far more moderately priced , all natural , and work extremely well on my skin \( thin , pale , dry and a bit sensitive \)
4	application is the same as any other nail polish , the drying time is less than 10 minutes and the polish survives just under a week for me \( i am very hard on my nails \) other reviews talk about an nightly applications of oil , which i am not doing so maybe the polish would last longer if i did \? i like the fact that i can change my polish weekly without an hour to allow my polish to fully dry or exposing my skin to uv rays the color selection is fairly vast with this product i have recommended it to several friends and will continue to do so as well as continue to purchase and use the product myself
5	love
4	i like this eyeliner because i can get a nice thin line close to my eyelashes it stays wet long enough that i can use the broken stem of a qtip to wipe away most mistakes \( i break them in half to use the stem to clean up mascara smudges too \) even though this bliss eyeliner is easier to use than other liners i 've tried , i still need more practice i like to apply thin lines , but you can can get thicker lines my the tip this is a liquid liner and does n't have a smudgy appearance it washes off with soap and water and does n't irritate my eyes
3	not quite as bright aqua as expected and shown but still a great color !
5	great product wears long
1	not amazing give me rash , , , , , too strong for my skin do not use if you have sensitive skin or on shaved legs !
2	although the texture of this therapy cream is very nice , i absolutely disliked the scent of the product which smells like coconut oil never having eaten a truffle , except the chocolate ones which are a real treat during the holidays , i have no idea of what a real truffle smell like but , this cream is not something i 'll be using
5	not bad
5	the actual polish is a little thicker than what i'm used to from other brands but the results are so much better than any other brands i love the color saturation and overall quality of the polish ! you just have to learn to put on light thin coats and add more layers as you go do n't clump on a thick layer ! the polish itself does not peel or chip off easily it really adheres well to the nail bed and i'm very happy with the purchase
2	i like soft pinks and found that this is too hot pink for me one of the reviews thought it was n't pink enough i like more tones , so this was not for me , even using one coat i will never use it again the one i love so far is negligee the bottle is white , the color is a classic , beautiful pink , see through slightly very classy i would never wear hot pinks , blues or crazy colors i am going to try some reds for the holidays , i ordered i like the color of it in the bottle , but have n't tried it yet
5	even though this brand is geared towards men , i had heard good things about this lip balm , and decided to pick it up it 's got a great , light scent , and , most importantly , is nice and thick , so that it stays on your lips so far , it also does n't seem to leave that white residue that other balms can leave it also does n't contain mint , which can dry out already chapped lips i'm going to stock up on this !
5	calvin klein 's eternity was one of my cologne 's during my high school and later college years that said i sort of away from the brand and others of the late 90s era including ck one and polo sport wow the memories ! so i was given a 1oz bottle of ck 's eternity aqua and i'm happy to say that i love it ! the smell is reminiscent of eternity \( from my memory \) and not overwhelming on the senses the aroma is a bit lighter and softer than eternity and also reminiscent of polo sport scent 's are so subjective so it 's difficult to write a definitive review but suffice to say that if you 're an eternity fan then you 'll likely like this take on the classic smell personally i 'd recommend popping into a department store and trying a sample before committing longevity is pretty good i typically wear aqua di gio and i do think that aqua tends to last a bit longer overall , great scent and something i intend on purchasing once my review sample is gone recommended !
5	i'm really happy with this product it moisturizes my face all night without giving me a greasy feeling , or worse , pimples it has a terrific smell , i think floral it makes my face feel smooth and the lovely smell ca n't hurt , especially if you put it on right after your shower , before you with your honey he 'll notice how smooth your face is and think you smell good too i'm not seeing any results as far as appearance , but did n't expect it that will come with time
3	it 's a nice product , but a little to light for me polish stays on well
5	used in conjunction with the rest of the pca line , an excellent cleanser !
4	eyeliners are very hit or miss for me , and price does n't seem to be a factor they either slide off , cause an allergic reaction , or do n't go on smoothly i love this one ! it goes on like , it stays on , and so far \( fingers crossed \) i 've had no redness nor itching i really like the attached smudged , which blends without removing there is a flaw , however , and i 've deducted a star accordingly i stored the case upside down that should n't be an issue the liner is retractable , after all the next time i opened the case , a two inch section of product was hanging out , and a quarter inch piece had broken off inside the case i managed to save the larger piece , but there 's no excuse for such shoddy packaging of a product at this price
5	gives me a great natural looking dark tan easy to apply and no streaks the only down fall is having to wash it off after 3 hours
4	light moisturizer for day use
1	after 20 minutes of battling with this container , i still could not get anything to come out it has a weird applicator and unlike other creams , there 's no way that i can figure out to remove the strange applicator to actually get to the product , because the pump thing that 's supposed to apply it clearly does n't work my fingers hurt from trying to pump the thing for so long , and i think i would have to actually break it to get inside of it i do n't even want to use it now , it 's
5	another terrific jane iredale product goes on smooth and feels light on the skin , with just a little color the spf 15 is a plus , too
5	this is a good item and priced a bit better than other places
1	so i used this product all up and do n't see or feel any different about my skin i used as directed but nothing has changed
5	beautiful color on ca n't wait to play wit it more
4	this scent is pretty powerful and perhaps it 's my age , but i prefer stronger fragrances less and less , on me and on others if you are n't careful , this scent can take over a room , and this is that way it is described a citrus scent and that 's what it smelled like and least initially scents are different on each person , of course , but this has a lighter , not fuller , scent to me a little goes a long way , lasting all day and filling into clothing it 's travel sized , as well , so there 's that overall , if you are fond of josie natori products especially , i recommend this
5	perfect as described and delivered quickly recommended for all who love gel nails cleanser type product that the nail prior to applying gels
4	i have tried many different corrective sticks i have an autoimmune condition which has left me with several broken capillaries on my face and these type sticks have proved to be i have a light complexion with if anything , a little bit of yellow so i have to be careful about getting any foundation or cover stick that is too dark or rosy this color sand worked great i put just a dab on after moisturizer the directions tell you to layer the cover stick and i do n't know why i had n't thought of that before , but it does help personally , i have to put a little bit of a foundation \( really a lightweight bb cream \) on top to help blend it in i do recommend this you may be able to find similar products that are cheaper but do know you are getting a nice , creamy quality cover stick if you go with this one
5	i love this it smells fresh and clean but is n't too aquatic or floral if you like jasmine you 'll like this it 's a very summery scent
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
3	the nail treatment is essentially another nail polish with some added ingredients for nail health , i think it has subtle pink color and nice sheen i did not notice much change in my nail condition with use and it chips off way too easily the package says to apply another layer in 3 4 days , but mine looked bad by the next morning , flaking away on all sides , no way it can stay on for 3 days
4	dermablend quick fix concealer stick is as great as the rest of the dermablend product line the applicator disperses the product easily and that helps with those quick make up fixes ! the concealer stick make up is just as easy to apply onto the skin it 's very smooth and silky and blends well into the skin i 've worked with other products that were much heavier and unnatural , so the smoothness of the product is a big plus to experience with the dermablend stick i should also add that i 've worked with some make up sticks that are fragile and break off , not this one it is firm and appears like it will last until the very end it definitely covers dark circles well and does n't patch up around the eyes , which is another big attribute after proper application , the product lasts long and wears well for hours my only concern , thus , the one missing star , is although i 've had no breakouts or irritation from the brand , my face , where i apply the product , feels a bit than the rest of my face of course , everyone is different and will experience different results
3	this serum comes in a tiny bottle with a dropper the texture of the serum is almost gel like , and it only takes a very small amount to cover your entire face , so i expect that this bottle would last a couple of months i'm not sure if i would get more results if i had really bad skin , but i really did not notice much difference on the fine lines around my face the reason i really would not repurchase it , however , is that the smell is obnoxious it is very floral , but to me , it is strange and too sweet maybe others would not find an issue with this i am continuing to use it , and if i see more results from it in the next couple of months , i will update this to reflect that
5	i'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps a brush after years of canned foam the proraso green soap croap is my favorite , and the white is very similar both are more of a croap \( cross between hard cream soap \) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap it lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush the marco method \( if you 're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather , google it you wo n't regret it \) , and provides a good , close , irritation free shave i lather in the plastic proraso bowl directly on the soap , then go straight to leg i have also done a separate bowl lather with this , and it worked nicely after use i leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat \( i shave in the shower store my soap there , so there 's a lot of water \) and then store it with the lid on the white has a slight menthol feel , but considerably less than the green in my opinion , the white has a light scent of roses fresh cut grass it 's very light and clean , and i think it could be considered the most feminine between the green , red white proraso soaps i had issues with irritation from the red proraso \( disappointing , since i loved the scent \) , but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me overall i am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation
4	beautiful color but it took 3 coats to get an even and opaque look per directions , used scrubfresh first and finished with the weekly top coat , but lasted really well two pictures one right after application , and second after 7 days pretty good after 7 days \( see attached picture \) , although my thumb and first finger show a little wear on the edges , but for 7 days of cooking , cleaning , and gardening , pretty good ! not as shiny or strong as shellac , but then again , it removes like traditional polish and the whole process is so much easier faster than shellac , so its a fair trade off would purchase again in different colors
3	this product made my face softer \( and oilier \) when i woke up each morning , but i cannot say i noticed much difference in lines or wrinkles after using it for 2 weeks i did have a few breakouts , but it appears other reviewers did n't have any just something to be aware of when trying a new product , of course it has a little scent , not overwhelming , and has a wonderful , creamy texture and applies easily a pea sized amount goes a long way , too a good thing since this is very pricey , 130 1 7oz at present overall , i'm not convinced it is worth the since at this price i expected the lines would show improvement it is , however , a nice moisturizer 3 stars
5	quick to ship , the item was received as described love this product ! will buy from again in the future thank you for a smooth transaction
4	i'm of two about this product i really like the matte \( peach \) but i'm less enthusiastic about the dewy \( pink \) side the matte side i have been using on the areas next to my nose , where i have large pores and roseacea it blurs the pores nicely , but barely has enough tint to deal with some of the roseacea it goes on smooth and silky , and almost instantly feels dry i like that , having very oily skin in that area it does n't last all day , but it has a nice compact and is easy enough to deal with in the middle of the day i 've used it on clean skin and also over oil free sunscreen it does n't seem to matter it works fine either way i have not tried it over makeup yet but i think it should work fine , because the foundation i use is also oil free \( silicon base like the sunscreen \) the dewy side i 've used on my cheekbones and above my eyes and i have to be really careful not to use too much , because it stays a little sticky if i use even a hair too much , and that drives me used very sparingly , though , it creates a nice , fresh , look neither side has made me break out , and i break out if i put anything remotely oily on my skin i think this is a really nice product if you have break through in oily areas of your skin , because it 's easy to carry and super easy to apply
5	i 've used many , many masks in the past , but this has to be my new favorite let 's start with the many , many pluses 1 \) easily fits on face and the backing easily off 2 \) not one drip ! not one ! wow ! 3 \) able to be torn \( with ease \) to fit perfect around eyes 4 \) every single bubble can be smoothed out 5 \) stays on face without slipping one bit ! \( again , wow ! \) 6 \) leaves skin plump and glowing negatives not one negative ! in total , i am demanding on my skin i use prescription retinoids \( every other day \) , i micro needle \( twice a week \) , etc sometimes it just really needs something to soothe it \( especially if i go a little nuts with the micro needling \) this does exactly that i am so impressed and , here 's a little tip use the left over liquid in the packet on your neck and hands they will be left just as smooth as your face truly phenomenal product ! i will buy this again and again highly , highly recommended
4	this was an add on still not really sure what it 's for but i use it and love the smell !
2	i tried my best to ignore the pain but i just could not get past two rounds of treatment , even at the lowest setting not that it was but it was just so unpleasant that i did not feel it was worth it plus my face was red for hours thus , i do not know if it works at all if you are used to laser treatments at the doctor 's office then you will probably be fine if you 're like me someone who has never had any laser treatments before using this device then i would say consider your pain threshold very carefully before paying for this product the manual states that regular use will result in diminished sensation of pain but unfortunately i could not continue otherwise , i found it very easy to use there are sound and display which lets you know the setting , how many pulses you 've done , assessment , and whether the laser pulse was properly delivered in addition , once you reach the maximum amount of pulses per treatment , the entire thing will shut down for four hours to prevent excessive use i also found the design to be aesthetically pleasing , an elegant device on my bathroom counter
3	the active ingredients in this sunscreen are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they are both and are often used in artists paint also diaper rash cream so if you apply it too thickly it will show up as white this sunscreen is not water resistant so if you 're swimming or sweating this is n't the one for you i really do n't know how far 2 5 ounces will go if you have to re apply it several time during an the pro niacin can cause flushing so use sparingly the first two week until your skin it prevents sunburn but does nothing to prevent skin cancer or signs of ageing i really do n't see the benefit of adding niacin to a sunscreen , but what do i know \? maybe its just me but i really cant figure out what makes this sunscreen worth almost 50 for 2 5 ounces
4	i received one bottle of vichy aqualia thermal sunscreen 24 hr hydrating lotion , 1 6 fl oz it is broad spectrum spf 25 normal skin it is suitable for sensitive skin and is allergy tested it is oil free , and does have a lightweight texture it feels light on your skin , spreads easily and absorbs quickly the scent reminds me of the beach uva uvb protection
5	beautiful color !
5	i own the facemaster as well as all of the nuface products i was looking for something that was hands free so i was excited to see this product unfortunately , it sits weird on my head and i end up having to hold it with one hand this makes it no easier or better than the nuface ! honestly , i saw results immediately with my facemaster , but its a hassle as you need two hands and a mirror nuface is a little easier because you only need one hand and maybe a mirror you can more easily maneuver the nuface so a mirror is not required i have n't seen any miracle with this strivectin as of yet but will keep using it even though it is quite uncomfortable on my head and needs to be held with one hand no i do not have a weird shaped head ! ! ! \) ok i have used this product for some time now and even though its not hands free like i had hoped , it is easier to use than nuface and facemaster so i tend to use it at least five days per week ! i can see visible lift to my upper face as in the eye area and upper cheek bones so far , not much around the jaw line maybe they need to come out with another product that sits lower on the face to target the jawline \? overall i really like this thing and i would definitely recommend it ! 10 2016 update the headset cracked ! i contacted strivectin and they offer a two year warranty and will send me a new one yay !
4	my t zone is incredibly oily at 61 and the rest of my skin is dry i have a couple of clogged white heads in that same area i was hoping this would help but it 's not helped so far it does help on my chin where i have black sebum inside my pores , diminishing them a little , each time i use the cleanser it has a faint aroma which is pleasant i am still searching for a product to slough off my skin in hopes of opening that clogged white head , which i got from using a moisturizer
5	most facial sunscreens caused my skin to break out , which is very frustrating this was given to me by my dermatologist it is a great sunscreen , can be worn under makeup without an issue , and works well i would highly recommend it
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	love this ! ca n't even tell i have sunscreen on ! it 's nice to have a daily moisturizer sunscreen that is n't too goopy
4	it was a surprising consistency , like aloe vera not much scent , but it is a good post shave gel almost seems like witch hazel and aloe
4	this is a pretty nice concealer from my favorite skin care company although the dark beige is too dark for my skin , it goes on easily and smoothly , and looks pretty good if you buff out the edges my skin is oily , so it does n't last all day , but that 's not really the fault of the concealer what i do n't like is the brush it works fine , and is actually convenient , but seems so to me every time you use it , you 'll be picking up bacteria from your skin even if you wash it , you ca n't do a thorough job without getting water up in the pen itself if i was going to continue using it \( and i would , if it was the right color \) , i would dispense some onto my finger and use it from there i would n't touch the brush to my face
5	i get nasty time of the month pimples usually on my chin my derm recommended this to me i do n't have horrible acne , but i use this as a spot treatment and then all over my face during my monthly to kill pimples before they form anyway after a month of using this i had a pimple on my face , put this on it and when i woke up in the morning , it was gone ! i love lrp i have their effaclar cleanser and the toner \( but i kept running out \) so i switched to the thermal spring water if you have sensitive skin like , french skincare \( especially lrp \) is the way to go warning when first using this product , be careful not to go out into the sun for the first few days your skin will be really sensitive to the sun i suggest using it at night at first or on a weekend when you are going to stay at home to get your skin used to it
3	really loved this product at first i have extremely acne prone skin and i did not feel like it was clogging my pores a little goes a long way , which is why i 've had the same tub for about 6 months now i never loved the smell to begin with \( too flowery for me \) , but after a few months i started to notice that it started to smell like it had gone bad not sure how to describe it exactly , but it smells almost like a hint of cow i'm going to toss the rest of the jar because it smells too gross to put on my face !
5	i am using my husbands account i love this blush however you have to use a light hand because it is very pigmented and it goes on to dark if you do n't it 's a pretty plum like color i do recommend this to anyone i am a makeup junkie and i am picky on my makeup and this is one i really like
5	i keep ordering this over and over and over the best facial moisturizer i 've ever tried and i 've tried many
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
5	this product gets a coveted 5 star rating those were looking for hair on a bald head should look elsewhere though you must have some hair in order for this to give the appearance of a thicker head of hair i have very fine hair and you can see my scalp through my hair this product does an incredible job of covering that it is very easy to apply and i strongly recommend you get the sprayer attachment if you have very thin hair this is definitely the product for you
4	the veneffect product seems to do what it promises but wow is it expensive ! the crevices around my lips are much smoothed i do n't notice that my lips are plumper but perhaps they are i am quite surprised at the difference in those deep wrinkles above and below my lips if the cream we 're not so expensive there are other parts of my face that i would like to use it on the only negative thing i can think of about it is that my lips seem dry when i am using it i apply it twice a day and have only skipped an application once the next time i put some on i could tell the wrinkles were already
5	i am a hot tools fanatic this big barrel is great for loose waves
5	plush rush in lucky is tan with a slight pink tint it is a very pretty color i usually go for a lipstick with more pink or red in it but this is an attractive color which i will definitely use i was n't thrilled with the scent it was sort of fruity violet , but it does n't last and it tastes pretty neutral i have n't used a plumping lipstick before so i was n't sure what was happening when my lips started to tingle i thought there might be some mint in it or something my lips look great i found that it was pretty long lasting not as good as one of those 12 or 24 lipsticks but it was more moist looking and feeling so in the balance i think this works well i do n't mind occasionally refreshing my lipstick , as long as it stays on my lips and does n't smear onto the rest of my face the lipstick comes in a smooth black case that is compact , chunky and stylish i am impressed with this butter london product and had a look at some of their other products on their website they make a point of having non toxic ingredients in their products there are some other colors of plush rush that look really pretty , i am seriously tempted by a bubblegum pink called , or a peach color called ! they also have some beautiful looking nail polish and eye shadow , and other lip products right now i am wearing this new color every day and liking it a lot !
5	beautiful dark plum only two coats needed great for fall winter season
4	this has a light , pleasant scent that is perfect for applying right out of the shower , and the scent lasts for quite a while my son really likes the scent and the large bottle size makes it a good value for the price
5	love the color and the quality of essie dark blue navy is pretty in as a color this year so i plan on wearing this polish a lot
4	very nice plumping gel one pump is all that is required for both eyes , so this small bottle will last a while there is no pain , no burn and no odor which makes for a great eye balm the primary mission of this balm is to renew the under eye zone with a bit of caffeine to plump and lots of emollients to smooth the lines , the balm goes on quickly and stays a bit wet to the touch for a while by wet i mean it is moist , not tacky and not uncomfortable the balm is a light color but absorbs in entirely clear i think the blue tint actually goes to help brighten the skin under the eyes all in all a nice additional touch before regular makeup in the morning routine
5	great consistency i love essie beautiful color too !
5	ok if you hate shaving \? ! \? ! get this , then go to youtube look up how to use shaving soap watch several videos then break out your soap cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try ! if you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet i hated shaving ! my skin always got irritated and burned after ! then i tried this stuff after watching hours of videos , i broke down and gave it a whack now mind you i'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and i get worn out in my chair quickly ! ! ! ! after using this i look forward to shaving i ca n't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause i'm going to shave i will spend the extra 10 min to get outta bed to go through the procedure to shave ! my skin comes out so smooth and irritation free ! ! ! ! ! ! and the girlfriend really noticed a difference ! spend the money , spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting ! ! !
5	this product really works as it says it is easy to apply it is not messy you apply it and it looks so natural and it lasts until you wash you hair amazing product
5	great
5	i'm 51 years old my face does not give away my age but my neck does i was considering going into for some type of laser or plastic surgery procedure when i ran across reviews for this product after using it for less than two weeks i can see a difference and am ordering more so i never run out do yourself a favor and give it a try !
3	i have never worn primer before and after trying this product , i will probably never wear it again it was n't that this product was so bad it 's just that i did n't notice any difference in my appearance here are some pros and cons pros 1 it went on smoothly 2 it felt nice on my skin 3 a little goes a long way ! 4 no scent which is great for sensitive skin 5 the pump jar is nice cons 1 it 's an expensive bottle for no evident change in my appearance ! 2 it does n't cover up blemishes 3 it 's sparkly ! not many women i know want to have sparkles on their face all in all , i do n't think i will be buying it it just seems unnecessary and is just one more layer of make up
3	div id video block class a section a spacing small a spacing top mini video block div input type hidden name value https images na ssl images amazon com images i mp4 class video url input type hidden name value https images na ssl images amazon com images i png class video slate img url nbsp we 've tried this a couple of times now , the massage feature took a bit of time to get used to you need to be gentle or you can hurt your eye the movement is strong so the more pressure you apply the more you will feel my wife has used this with her face cream and not sure it made any big difference but this does work great if you have a headache and it feels really good on the nose , well my nose anyway but for 100 it 's not that great what i found with this is it needs to be charged first , then the instructions say to press the button at the same time to perform and initial unlock if it 's not turning on after that , just press the round contour button to turn on , 1st press is for the massage and vibrate , 2nd press turns off the vibrate , 3rd press turns it off the buttons increases and slows the intensity video attached is the movement
5	cnd has done it again this is a pretty pink that lasts two plus weeks without chipping and staying shinny
1	first , the color shown here , which looks like a soft apricot , was actually a garish orange my toes look like i am wearing orange peel ! second , as another reviewer mentioned , the polish goes on streaky , and it was only after much effort , and much time , that i was able to achieve some semblance of coverage i have never thrown out a polish , but this one i did i think i will stick to opi polishes , they have a better quality overall as for this essie polish complete fail , i hated it ! !
5	lotion is light and easy to apply liquid consistency bottom is opaque , and dispensing is done with pump action lid is fit pull out cap without any screwing motion lotion flows easily with each pump dispensed and applies thinly over skin and feels light on skin lotion contains several light oils as ingredient smells faintly medicine like without strong perfume
5	great coverage and lasting color
3	this lumarx women 's foil shave is a good size and shape for a woman but i do not care for where they put the trimmer , i think a smaller one on the side would of been a better design the shave was fairly good , never are you going to get a close shave with an electric as you do with a regular blade shave this comes with a cleaning brush plus travel bag , nice if you take it along on a vacation , then you can do a fast leg shave as necessary i tried it both in the shower and in the bathtub , it worked well enough , but , i still prefer a regular blade shave , myself
5	i absolutely love this stuff ! ! it covers your scalp and seems to make your hair seem fuller i no longer worry that people will see my balding head it even helps kind of cover my gray hair at the roots i really do love toppik ! it works great !
4	leaves behind a bit of sticky feeling but helps keep make up on beautiful
5	best product i have found for summer it is a lightweight sunscreen that reminds me of a tinted moisturizer it has just enough pigment to cover imperfections i add a little bit of base if i want more coverage amazing how it adapts to skin colors you do n't need to try to figure out which color
3	i have pretty dry hands i often find i get paper cuts from cardboard ! so i'm game to try any new hand cream in the hopes that something will help i was pretty excited to try this mud intensive hand cream having tried many creams i would rate this one average i feel you can get similar moisture with store bought hand creams like aveeno for a dramatically decreased price it has a rather strong scent and i did notice that it left a smooth , waxy sheen on my skin but i wash my hands a lot for work and my sign of a good cream is that is gives me a good protective coat that penetrates my skin sadly after after the first wash most of it had come off even after letting it soak prior to washing for 30 min a good hand cream for dry hand for me will still retain some moisture even after the third hand wash i do n't think there is anything wrong with this hand cream just that it does n't my requirements of hand moisture it is n't bad but for the price i expected something more spectacular
5	great color , perfect for fall
5	if you need some full coverage powder , this is it i was so surprised at how well it covers i apply foundation in the morning , and rather than having to carry any with me for touch ups , this powder does the trick i'm very pleased with dermablend 's entire line
5	i love cnd vinylux works as promised does not damage my nails like gel does easy to apply and fast drying
5	i have several xen tan products and they work very well this product is no exception this is lighter i color than the other products , but it is still easy to apply without streaks their tanning mitt is highly recommended for application it is easy to use and washes out easily to be ready for the next application using the mitt never looks orange or leaves streaks of color when i use it i love these products that give me some color without having to have the harmful effects of sunlight five stars !
5	my husband with skin rashes from shaving he had a beard for 20 years but his current job requires that he be clean shaven he 's tried a lot of shave creams but likes this one best he loved the mild scent and the really close shave he gets he has n't had any skin irritation , ingrown hairs or acne i tried it as a face wash and it is quite mild but cleans the scent is gender friendly regardless my husband likes this so much i will put it on my subscribe and save if it is available he 's asked me to keep it in stock and i will do that ! great shave cream for sensitive skin
5	i have very sensitive skin over the years i have tried many different things to help this is the second order of proraso shaving soap i have made and i do not anticipate changing the product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent this was good for me as i also do n't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells this shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint the most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously i use this shaving soap and switched to a de razor although my skin has n't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else i have tried through the years i am very happy with this purchase
4	lash curler \? sure ultimate \? eh i ca n't see what would set this lash curler above the rest oh , do n't get me wrong it 's definitely better than the cheap one i got out of desperation once at a cheap chain store for a few bucks that lash curler was truly worthless however , i 've used a variety of other lash curlers from the beauty store over the years and most of them work just as well as this one comparing this one to my lash curler that came recently in an ipsy bag , i actually think the one curled a bit better and also felt less because the handles are wider that said , this georgie curler was almost just as good and cost a few dollars less it does come in a nice box for packaging and they include a few extra which are nice as they can get worn out or fall off after much use all that said , there is nothing ultimate about this lash curler , i 'd say it 's quite average and does it 's job fine but it is not the ultimate lash curler , no
4	girlfriend loves it for foot massages
4	i would do without the glitter in the polish it was a great color and amazing for summer great part of the summer collection
5	i had previously tried the red sandalwood soap and preshave , as well as the green soap and preshave i have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave \( menthol and eucalyptus \) , as well as by itself i found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other proraso soaps , which is to say that you 'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen i found that blooming the soap was of limited utility , as this is n't a hard soap puck , but rather more like a stiff cream the proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties it gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off to me , it smells like tea tree oil a somewhat sharp , almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and wo n't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave i have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the proraso green pre shave i apply the pre shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking \( just a few minutes \) , then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing you may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go , but this stuff , when properly hydrated , is slick all but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff i was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself with a safety razor and a good blade , the stubble comes off almost like magic i was just able to perform my closest ever shave with this tactic highly recommended associated gear parker 99r safety razor boker tree brand straight razor escali badger hair brush proraso green pre shave
4	i really like this polish color however , it is much more of a candy apple red than the pinkish red hue suggests in the photo there is no pink in it whatsoever \( see photo \) seller did a great job of packaging and sending on time
5	i got do n't me around more purple than i would like for a nude but still a pretty color
3	i'm usually an opi girl , but i saw this color on a lady and loved it the color is great , but the essie formula is a little watery \( i needed 3 coats \) i 'll probably be sticking to opi
4	i really do like this body scrub there is no warming sensation they talk about in the description , but it is a luxurious scrub \( if you do n't mind a heavier menthol type scent \) i like the scent because both i and my husband can use it as it 's neither feminine or masculine \( and everyone needs to exfoliate regardless of gender \) it definitely leaves a clean , refreshed feeling to your skin without any gross residue i have very sensitive skin and it did n't irritate me at all , which is another huge plus as it 's hard for me to find exfoliating scrubs that do n't irritate my skin if you do n't mind a scent that has heavy menthol to it and you want a unisex body scrub that works well i highly recommend this
5	i love london butter products ! i really like the 10x nail lacquer i put it on leave to dry over night put the top coat on in the morning and it last me several days this is a record for me lots nail polishes last for maybe two days on me i love how may nails feel when i remove this polish
5	i love the roller ball application , it helps me get on a good amount of serum without making a mess and it just simply feels nice as it glides across my skin i do believe i am seeing a tightening in my skin but also believe that this is not a miracle worker in that if you have a lot of saggy neck skin this is n't going to miracle it all away but it does tighten and give a nice look to my neck it also feels cool while applying and i like that as a little refresher in my day
4	this is has a scent i like and removes makeup very well , but gently i have used some of vichy 's moisturizer samples and have liked them also , great brand i took one star off because unfortunately this cleanser does n't make my skin feel fully clean after just rinsing with water , it leaves too much of a moisture residue so i have to use another cleanser to remove the greasy feeling it leaves behind
5	this stuff lets me get away with washing my hair less it makes it less oily it 's incredible smooth hair and less oil the smell is a little bit on the masculine side but it 's not over powering i shared a jar and it lasted 2 years
5	i have used this product for years it is a good product
5	great stuff a little goes along way my hair is both colored and blow dried every day i have n't had an off day since i stared using this ps i'm 59
5	i think this is a great hand cream it 's thick but easily gets absorbed into the skin without leaving residue
3	i absolutely love the supersmile toothpaste and whitening gel set i bought this to compliment that set i hate usually , and do n't use it but , thought that i would give this a try it doesnt burn when you are using it , but you can tell that its working you are supposed to it around for 30 seconds in your mouth and then brush your teeth as usual it gives you that just came from the dentist feeling which is nice but , it is strong so i find that i do not use it as much as i should very large bottle and you use so little will last a long time but , i do not plan to reorder
4	this moisturizer does an excellent job of moisturizing without adding any shine to your face , the texture is very smooth and it is absorbed fairly quickly without a greasy or heavy feel very nice scent it 's not clear if it has made a difference in crow 's feet and smile lines , but certainly does n't hurt
5	the curling iron works really well , curls come out really pretty and last all day no issues with over heat and especially like cord seller very good about sending product arrived earlier than expected and packaged very well
3	this was my first time trying a strivectin product the tl tightening face serum is a white lotion that is in a pump dispenser it has a mild , pleasant scent it is very pricey , i have never used a tightening serum that costs this much , so i'm not able to compare it to similar professional brands i like the scent , it is not flowery \( which i sometimes have irritation with \) , the lotion dissolved quickly as with any new cosmetic product , i started with a very small amount to make sure no irritation occurs i did not have any problems irritation using this after applying , i do feel a tightening effect , however it is not a cure all for wrinkles my sagging skin i'm not sure if my expectations were too high based on the cost of the product , but for me , it was not a fountain of youth some of the things i really liked about this product 1 \) paraben free 2 \) did not cause irritation 3 \) pleasant scent
5	i have moisturized my whole life i get compliments on my skin and if i ask for a drink when i go out , i am 42 little do people know , i have never missed a day of moisturizing my skin i love serums and think they absorb into the skin really well i read this was scented so was not surprised when i smelled it i actually like it but we all have a personal preference after i get out of the shower i apply this to my legs and my skin soaks it right up i also use it on my and arms my arms sometimes get dry but this has really helped i wore it out last night and i paired it with a perfume i thought blended well with it and my skin looked good but most of all , it felt great i like the texture of this serum and also the smell it might not be for everyone i also think a little goes a long way i will probably use it 3 times a week and switch between my other moisturizers i can see the difference in my arms and legs , the skin looks smoother i have used other products from vichy and they are fabulous i guess you could say the brand just works for me
4	pretty color but it takes a lot of coats to be opaque i put white under it
4	i love using micellar water to clean my face this has made a big difference for my complexion i 've tried quite a few different brands i'm happy to report that this vichy product barely has any fragrance , which is not the norm in my experience with vichy just put a little micellar water on a cotton pad and swipe it over your face to remove makeup grime no rinsing required it really refreshes your complexion recommended
5	first off , i think the packaging is really smart different elements and clip together to form a palette i'm planning on stocking up on a few more jouer products so i can make a nice travel compact i love the consistency and color of this blush it blends really well and is very natural looking it 's a lovely cream blush , and i apply it with my fingers i like that it 's a small size this makes it very portable for travel my skin can be fairly sensitive , but i have n't had any reactions to the jouer products i 've tried
5	great summer color new nail polish dries so much better very happy with color it was a risk online i love all things hot pink and this is true to family yipppee
5	very very pretty color , goes on good wears very good !
3	i ordered one color and they sent me a different one luckily i liked the color they sent me but it just was n't the one i ordered it came on time thought
4	i'm way past the fine line stage of life , so i do n't expect a lot from creams that reduce the appearance of fine lines what i expect is a cream that goes on lightly , does n't clog pores and wo n't compete with my perfume this eye cream passes all three tests it 's more a gel than a cream , and it goes on lightly and does n't feel heavy it has n't caused me any skin troubles and has no discernible scent the ingredients list is long , with ten certified ingredients , such as fruit juices and moisturizing oils and butters the magic word hyaluronic acid is last on the list , while the fruit juices top the list and give the product is stem cellular name \( we 're not talking controversial human stem cells here ! \) the only funky thing about this product is the container it has a dr looking pump that causes the bottle to be a third taller than it needs to be i 'll never understand why companies think we 'll be wowed by a new and different container it uses more plastic than it needs to , and because the lid is not , there will be product left at the bottom , out of reach of the pump , so i took off one star for that i hate throwing product away
5	this lotion is not terribly thick , which makes it easy to massage into my skin and do n't get me wrong despite being thin , this lotion really helps my dry skin my skin feels almost creamy after using it , especially compared to the less expensive lotions i normally use the smell is not overwhelming , but a smell is there it is not a bad smell at all , but it is n't a traditional floral or food based scent it 's hard to put my finger on what it smells like maybe that 's from the combo of wheat germ , peanut oil and honey extract overall , i'm pleased with this lotion i work outdoors quite often , even in the winter i 'll keep a bottle handy for the times my hands get really rough
5	i adore the davines oi products i 've tried a few different products in the line and have loved them all , and this product is no exception when used along with davines this is a relaxing fluid after shampooing and conditioning hair with luxury wash and rinse this made my hair feel great it felt healthier and smoother with less frizz and also held the style well after blowing my hair out i used to question any some salon products could be so expensive , but after trying a few products from davines and the oi line in particular it is clear that it is because they actually work for my hair type thick , naturally wavy , and color treated blonde this is the perfect product i would recommend !
5	i had never heard of la roche posay until a few years ago , but i 've really become a fan of their products i buy their sunscreens exclusively , but this is the first time i 've tried one of their makeup products without a sunscreen component so far i like it it 's a little light but i always get a light and a darker version of any foundation i buy because i live in hawaii so my skintone changes a bit depending on how diligently i reapply my sunscreen so i mix the lighter and the darker ones to create a custom color for my skin on any given day i really like the way this feels going on , it 's light and spreads evenly and smoothly because it is so light i do have to cover a couple little dark spots i have with concealer before i use it , but i 'd rather do that than use a heavier foundation
5	this is a great product that my wife says is really good it comes in a nice little compact and it works great it goes on very easy and she said it stays on during the day without any problems this is n't she normally wears but she would definetly use again
5	it does not burn my under eye area like some eye creams do
5	i use this product in conjunction with the lotion , the cleanser , the face cream the rosacea product line by pevonia is the only line that gives me relief from the itching , burning , redness caused by my rosacea the products are not inexpensive , but it is a fantastic investment in my skin !
5	nice
5	really gorgeous dark navy with hints of blue
5	i requested this for my wife , and little did i know how much she 'd love it it came in such a luxurious package , and even the fancy metal \( as opposed to plastic \) spatula impressed her that was just the start it smells great , feels smooth , and skin is left feeling plump and refreshed the product claims powerful hydration , and more than anything , it 's a superb moisturizer powerful hydration indeed the fly in the ointment is the cost everyone has different and , but more than any other ridiculously pricey stuff she 's tried , this is the one that amazed the misses , and that makes me happy
5	great
5	while most of my adult life i have been a soap and water girl , getting into my late fifties i have become an anti wrinkle cream junkie i order my makeup online from nordstroms or neiman so i can get all the anti wrinkle skincare samples they include to try i have used them all from chanel , kiehls , on to the walgreens or offerings such as neutrogena , ponds oil of olay , and of course the sales of mary kay , and other up and coming companies your friends are selling as you try to hide and ignore the sales i can say very honestly this is a luxury product and feels amazing on my skin gently softens and works out the fine lines near my eyes a light sheen when first applied it seems to hold without stretch or drying , just floats on in a light white cream silky smooth and my makeup goes on wonderfully after applied no splotches of buildup does not fade away , your skin feels protected you can come back and rinse your face after wearing for hours and you can feel the glide of the product still there , still protecting but not heavy you do n't feel either i just love it you also get a very generous amount in this plastic type tube bottle which i find is less wasteful and more sanitary that jar creams i out a small dab on the back of my hand near my thumb and apply on my face with fingertips from there will keep it from being bumped or accidently wiped off and is a foundation makeup artist trick i have learned i am almost 58 and work daily in the outdoors at our horse farm i have had too much exposure to the sun through the years but i am watching out now for my skin as i age i am such a lucky person to have received a chance to try this formula on my skin i know now that it is worth the price while price is nothing to sneeze at , it is still more affordable than many questionable products sold at large stores like , , neiman , etc or that friend with that of fancy marketed products you 've been avoiding
3	had used this product for several years and although it is good , i have since found more effective and less expensive retinol products
4	i like being tan but i avoid the sun religiously the mitt is really the key to getting this product on properly this went on evenly , more so than i have ever seen a tanning product of any sort it just looks amazing however , ten seconds later , you realize you have to stay still for an hour and not put anything on for over four hours i have a moving disorder called add lol if i stop moving , i see things i have to do if i try to stop moving , well , i cant i have failed completely to use this product properly or to get the benefits from the product , but it is entirely my own fault
4	i generally have had a pretty positive experience with this eye cream my main concern with it is the price it is currently sitting at 42 50 for that price , i would hope it works miracles as it is , it does a pretty good job it took me a few tries to figure out how to best work the pump and applicator it takes a little getting used to , but once it 's going , it generally does a good job if you accidentally pump a little too much of the cream out of the applicator part , though , it is hard to do a good job overall , i like this product , but at the price point , i'm not sure i can continue using it
5	great product !
4	one of my favorite perfumes and the fact that it is unisex is awesome i'm gifting this for my nephew
3	i have tried the juice beauty clearing serum before and one of my sons used it regularly we both loved it so it was with great to try out this whole kit the only thing we both like out of this entire kit is the clearing serum that has n't changed the other stuff \? it 's ok the moisturizer tends to be too watery for me he says he likes it he really likes the cleanser as well , but the moisturizer is n't all that special for him he did n't try the peel , but i did and along with the moisturizer , the peel tends to make my skin burn a little bit it did help prevent acne from getting worse though neither one of us have acne , just sensitive skin it smells great it feels great and for the price , it is a good deal i just think the moisturizer needs to be a bit thicker rather than runny the peel \? i can do without it is a good kit price and it might work for some people but we really like the serum and the cleanser the best it does leave your face feeling clean
3	amazing dry shampoo best i 've ever tried but tiny tiny amount that does n't last long at all and so expensive ! ! i ca n't justify buying this when regular drugstore dry shampoo works almost as well
4	this has a firm , gel like quality in the hand the blue color does n't show up in your hair after you smear it in it 's got good firm hold without making the hair crunchy or brittle i have a nice wave in front and this helps me accentuate it and still be touchable or greasy downside it works best with shorter hair on me if my hair gets longer , it does n't work as well , with my hair ending up at odd angles and needing further brushing and combing good stuff for just after a haircut , but not as good if i let my hair go for a while
2	i'm a huge essie fan and loved this color in the salon bought on amazon and it was goopy and not the quality i 've learned to expect something was off
4	after a few weeks of using this serum in the morning and evening , i have noticed a softening of lines around my eyes and forehead i would not say the effect is remarkable at this point , but it is apparent the use so far seems to indicate that continued use will lead to further softening of lines and healthier appearing skin i have not experienced any side effects , and i would categorize my skin and eyes as being sensitive i think for consumers the question is whether the potential for a noticeable benefit is worth the additional cost of this product over a traditional moisturizer
5	this this is my holy grail product i'm a 26 year old woman who got through just fine but lately have been experiencing some incredibly irritating breakouts this has helped tremendously with lighting the post breakout marks and has completely turned my skin around before taking the plunge and shelling out for this serum i was how my skin was looking dull and slightly textured it was n't breaking out all over but i was noticing some roughness and unevenness on my forehead in particular that exfoliating did n't seem to help after one use i noticed my skin appeared a bit brighter i 've been using it semi religiously for close to a year now and it has turned my skin around i still get occasional breakouts that i'm trying to solve via changes , spot treatments , new haircare products etc but most of my skin is clear , bright and dewey i 've always had freckles that darken in the summer but this serum used in conjunction with an spf gives extra protection and keeps the darker spots at bay also , i 've just started using this on my neck and d eacute colletage area as well and am experiencing the same wonderful results i did on my face the serum has a nice , very mild citrus smell it feels a bit oily at first \( just use a few drops \) but it absorbs very quickly into the skin \( i have combo skin and this has in no way contributed or caused further breakouts \) the dark bottle is a nice touch as it protects the serum from early though i do wish the dropper were n't an integrated part of the bottle i feel like a different style dropper could even better protect the product from i generally only use 5 drops a day for my face , 5 6 for my neck area so a bottle takes months to get through and i am always a bit worried that it will go bad before i can finish it overall though , do yourself a favor and give this amazing product a try note if you receive a serum that appears brown , it has oxidized making it ineffective and you should return or exchange it this should be clear golden yellow in color and be sure to keep it in a cool , dark space
5	my hands are now silky smooth living in vegas my skin dries out and i frequently get using the baxter hand cream keeps my hands nice and soft and there is no oily residue left behind the smell is very faint which is nice in a men 's hand cream as you do n't want an over powering scent
5	wonderful texture and weight , lovely scent , and my skin feels wonderful ! ! i highly recommend all of the products in the elemis line !
5	my previous pomade by baxter of california did n't go as well as this one did i guess i just needed a different level of hold , so the cream pomade is the one for me it seems pros holds my short ish hair well and all day it 's a good hold and looks natural the scent is very light a little goes a long way cons it 's a small jar all in all , this is a very nice pomade i 'll buy this again as the other product i buy is nbsp a data hook product link linked class a link normal href bumble and bumble tech 1 5 ounce jar dp ref cm cr arp d rvw txt \? ie utf8 bumble and bumble tech , 1 5 ounce jar a , which is 35 for 1 5oz and for me , this works just as good
5	i got this for my wife because she has been experiencing very bad adult acne that only seemed to be getting worse since she was the one who needed it , i asked her to explain the results to me so i could write the review english is not her first language , so i wrote it the way she explained to me i did put it against my own skin to know how it felt and i put it in a shallow dish of water to convince myself it was indeed generating vibrations \( my wife of 30 years died of cancer after a long depressing six year battle in my new wife is considerably younger , but even she can have medical problems \) so the rest of this is in her words except i converted it into english i to the united states from the philippines in 2013 when i was approaching 25 years old i never had pimples or facial breakouts until i arrived here it has become progressively worse this past year and was to the point i desperately needed to do something to solve severe adult acne breakouts that seem to appear at random i suspect the source of some of my problems must be diet related so i plan to get allergy tests performed i eat a much more diverse range of foods today that i could never have in my past life by the time this clarisonic mia fit arrived five weeks ago , i was at a stage with very bad acne on my cheeks , forehead and chin i got off to a bad start when i used the sample facial cleanser that was included one side of my face turned a bright red like a rash i probably incorrectly associated it with the sample cleanser and stopped using it immediately and i lost in the entire system for the next three weeks i went back to my regular routine with a new product called garnier skin active scrub to my pores and clear my complexion it was n't really working that well , so i began to use this clarisonic mia fit again and continued with the garnier skin scrub and it really started to make a visible and undeniable improvement it has to be the result of this sonic cleanser brush currently im on a ten day trip and now i fully appreciate how portable and compact this rechargeable cleaner is it takes up very little space in my luggage its been a week so far and the battery still performs without any noticeable decline in intensity thats good because i forgot to bring the charger the cleansing brush is very soft and feels really nice against my skin i had strong doubts the vibration truly cleaned the pores in my skin , but now im a firm believer i have been using it to remove residual makeup after my first pass of soap and water to remove the majority of the makeup it makes the job not only easier , but i can feel this clarisonic mia fit has done a much more thorough job of removing all the makeup my skin really feels smooth and far cleaner compared to what i was doing obviously , ill have to update my results as i use the sample and other cleanser products and if i determine if a large part of my problems are diet related i think it will still take weeks to even months to really get all my skin problems solved , but at least i am confident i now have the tools to regain the good skin complexion i had four years ago
5	i love shellac nail polish ! this color is amazing and goes with everything ! the shine lasts for weeks with this color and is super durable this nail polish last 2 weeks i would recommend it to anyone and everyone ! it can easily be applied at home with the use of a uv light uv lights can also be purchased on amazon ! i love this product so much that i have purchased over 20 bottles of it throughout the past 4 years
5	beautiful , smooth applying color
5	been using pevonia products for 20 years any time a try something else , for say savings or convenience , i regret it and return to the best match for my skin natural ingredients makes a difference
5	it really works both to remove makeup and simply as a morning or end of day cleanser gentle and completely non irritating , i highly recommend it
3	adult male here i 've been known to use some facial products to combat father time for me as a male , i used this meaningful beauty oil once per instructions \( 3 drops on face , etc \) the scent then caught me by surprise the actual fragrance scent definitely not masculine and scent on the heavy side smells like musty flowers \( and brought back memories of my late great aunt \) the actual oil spreads on face easily though feels slightly greasier than i prefer so since scent was n't right for me i did what any normal man would do i wrapped it up and gave it to my wife as a surprise gift p ! my wife likes the oil for the skin results she 's not crazy about the scent \( too strong , too flowery \) but she says the actual results are pretty good to reduce fine lines and give skin overall healthier appearance makes you wonder if unscented version of this product might be a idea so overall , expensive at current price of 64 for small size , goes on smooth but slightly oily , scent is too strong and flowery , actual skin results pretty good overall 3 star rating by me relative to the competition
1	felt like baby oil very heavy on the skin broke my skin out
5	daughter was thrilled i could order this for her
5	love the color ! perfect for summer just like what you buy in the store for more than half the price
5	i learned about french skincare maybe a year ago from my dermatologist now i ca n't tell you if it does anything for wrinkles because i'm 26 but i can tell you that since i started using this , my skin has changed i use la roche posay effaclar because the dermatologist recommended it there was a toner which i used for a month or so but then i ran out and ended up discovering this after a few youtube videos and some reviews , i figured i would try it yes it water but it 's not just water think of the water that your or maybe your great used to drink it 's pure water untouched by man i use this product as a toner before i put on my daytime moisturizer , in the middle of the day when my skin is feeling parched and just recently i used it to set my makeup i do n't use makeup daily , a few times a month maybe so i heard you could set your makeup using this i tried it , and had some blot papers in my purse just in case i finished my makeup around , i did n't get home until 2 am no touch ups i know what you 're thinking all night without a touch up \? yes there was virtually no shine on my face my makeup looked just as good as it did when i put it on so use this
1	i had heard good things about this product , but after using it i noticed it really tangled my hair in the shower i have pretty thick hair and i do n't recall any other shampoo ever doing this to my hair after using it , it took me quite some time to comb out all the split ends in my hair and i am a man so i do n't have super long hair surprised and disappointed
4	this product is so smooth and silky when i applied it it also has a very light scent that i do n't mind at all the bottle packaging is a bit bulky for the amount of product it contains and takes up unnecessary space in my makeup drawer , thus the 4 star rating love it and definitely recommend it !
5	this foundation has a different feel to it creamy , yet dry but it goes on easily leaving a smooth foundation that looks great rubbed between your fingers , it has the feel of a good quality primer slightly dry i used a brush and fingertips to apply , and both worked well you can easily get by with a small drop of product having no choice of color for this review , i received the darkest tint , honey beige it is several shades darker than what i would use , light beige , but i was able to use just a small amount , the size of a pea , which provided a nice , matte coverage that did not look too dark at 30 , it is not cheap , but a small amount goes a long way and the product is very comfortable to wear and gives nice coverage when my current foundation runs out , i will be tempted to try this again , in a lighter shade
5	the color is light bluish grey so , do not be deceived by the picture of the product i absolutely love quality of cnd brand so , yes will keep it as it goes practically with any summer clothes i
5	this ahava time to revitalize extreme night treatment smells amazing it 's an herbal , natural scent that gives the treatment a luxurious feel the actual product is thin , and directions say to use two drops , which the pump dispenser gives easily without any waste it glides over my face , absorbs quickly and does n't leave my skin looking greasy i 've found my skin is smooth , soft and plump after using and while , not its intended purpose , i actually love and prefer to wear this underneath my makeup during the day it 's just enough moisture , the silky textures lets my makeup glide onto my skin , and makes it look all around more glowing i will 100 be repurchasing !
5	like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around its a larger amount than i expected ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps they last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them this one is very pleasant , very nice shave , lathers easily \( i have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1 5 its a 2 1 2 \) and im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation i have a tough beard that grows in many directions and i would definitely recommend this soap
4	love the color
5	minty , cool , fresh feeling easy to lather
5	oribe can never go wrong in my book this smells amazing to refresh second day hair , and it 's great for boosting flat hair
4	these face gels are a short term face firmer , best used before a special event the menthol cools and plumps the skin somewhat , reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles certainly not a more long lasting solution like botox , but does n't your face like botox i'm not sure i would repurchase these as i find it difficult to incorporate them into my usual routine
5	i'm tired lol i 've been on a long journey \( ok , a few weeks \) to find a new foundation i'm 50 , my skin is different and the once great everyday minerals \( olive tones \) is making my pores and rougher texture more noticeable i'm half japanese and half caucasian and it 's a pain for find the right color for me ! everything is either pink or orange on me ! well i 've look high and low end trying to find something that would work for me liquids and powders , both loose and pressed cc and bb 's and all in between ! bought this without doing any research at my local mall my first color was a bomb , too orange in the natural light they replaced it with golden glow after many test wears and having the family tell me what they thought i think i found my foundation pros very fine milled and does not show fine lines and pores , really softens and smooths out the skin coverage is very buildable color is not pink or orange ! very yellowish in tone cons yep , it 's a pricey one my suggestion is that if at all possible buy first at a store to find your color match lots of different colors in the pressed powder
5	this is a godsend if you have scars or other dermal imperfections you want to conceal i have a surgical scar on my knee and this is by far and away the best product i have ever used to hide that scar this product is a well known and well trusted and well established name in skin care products and i was just delighted when this became available to me i admit i am surprised that others did not have a good experience with it , but i chalk it up to everybody 's needs are different and i am among the lucky percentage for whom this product worked well i love this product just for the scar concealer that it is i ca n't thank the manufacturers enough for creating such a helpful product that is very easy to put on and discreet enough to carry in your bag
3	so how long does this take to work \? \? i have been using for a week and see no difference in my dark circles the blue or brown i do like the metal applicator that dispenses just the pea sized amount recommended for each application i also like the no fragrance of the product i just want to know when does it work \? \? how long do i use this to see results \? \? does it take one whole tube or two tubes or what \? \? i did not expect a miracle overnight but did think i would see something in a week i will revisit this review with an update when if i see results my dark circle cream came from amazon and will return for more should this give me the desired results
5	if you want the best sulfate free shampoo this is the one ! ! ! buy it is so good , and if you use the treatment and the conditioner you will get the best hair you can imagine ! !
4	this cologne comes in a nice package with carry , perfect for gifting the scent is light and not too sweet , heavy , or overpowering it is long lasting and only takes a bit to add a flair to the air ! highly recommended as a treat for self or that special person
5	i have a small spot on my face that i thought was an age spot but may just be a discoloration from working outside in the sun too much i have used this nightly for weeks now and i do see it growing lighter and may gradually disappear i think it is changing all my skin though because it looks better and i did n't even know anything was wrong with the rest of my face , but my skin does look better there is a faint smell to this that is not bad but for some reason i do n't like it it 's not a cream but more like a gel and a little bit goes a long way my skin is slightly oily and it 's working for me i'm not sure how well it would work on someone who has dry skin
4	my doctor recomended this line to me and i have slowly started to use more and more i am not sure i saw a significant difference in my skin because of the serum or if i saw a difference from another product on this line i can say that my skin feels tighter , the lines are less noticable , and the spots have faded i use , not only the serum , but also the total repair cream , the eye lift cream and the total cleanser , in to the resurfacing mask , which is my favorite thing ever ! ! i can not , however , use all of them at the same time everyday or my skin will go dry \( i am guessing due to the retinal \) i use the serum in the am and just the total skin repair at night , if i try to combine the two my face itches and is a bit uncomfortable i would recomend this line to anyone my age \( 40 \) and up , just use caution and introduce new products slowly
5	this is one of the best skincare products i 've ever tried in late 2013 i went for a facial it was a first ever manual face treatment that impressed me by an immediate effect i went back a couple of times and at the beginning of 2014 bought all the products that esthetician used on my face four years later this is only the product i swear by i'm 38 years old and i do n't have any smile lines around my eyes people tell me that it 's impossible that i'm that old my eyes do n't have wrinkles ! since the age of five , i always had under eye bags and circles i 've tried many skin care products , but nothing was making the difference , except this serum \( and chanel beauty discontinued \) my under eye area is not perfect , but i do n't have to wear concealer on daily basis and my eye bags are gone i wish everyone tried this product it 's a miracle in a bottle
5	my hairdresser used this product on my roots and it really made a difference so i bought some i apply it not only to roots but overall to my hair to give it texture this makes styling so much easier it also helps hold my curl when i want to use the curling iron
3	ii have bought this to work with the toothpaste whitening kit i have used the toothpaste with the past without the rinse and thought this would in getting better results i have to say i saw no difference , using this in addition it also made my teeth sensitive i will use it until it 's gone , but wo n't buy again i will say if you have very stained teeth , this definitely may help i will continue to buy the toothpaste !
5	cleans softly , does n't leave a residue this is good stuff , would be a great part of any beauty routine
4	okay , here goes normally , this is n't my thing , but i am not getting any younger , and i figured , what the heck \? it was very easy getting everything out of the above average packaging , and separating the various parts following the directions was simple they were well written , with just enough science type language to make me feel as if this might have some legitimate basis to it i was a little nervous about the micro current , but it was n't bad at all , and even felt a bit nice after i got used to it i probably did not go an entire five minutes , but i have a short attention span i am going to make an effort to try this regularly for a long enough time that i can return and let everybody know how well it worked here 's hoping i soon have the face of a 20 year old ! \( and that they do not ask for it back \)
5	darn near perfect the cases , along with low quality items , are generally what sink items like this to save money , the manufacturer will often use items that are very middle of the road \( at best \) to keep the overall cost down kind of like the difference between buying a set with included , or buying everything separately and then there is the case they quickly together to hold the items , which is usually falling apart even before opening the package , letting items slip out through large gaps , or bang together and get scratched for this kit , they took a item , their nail clippers , and packaged it with other useful items in a fantastically good case the nail clippers are fantastic they 've been around for years now , and with good reason they are nickel thin when put away , super sharp , and easy to use there is a little trick to pulling out the handle and setting it into the , so if your clippers are n't closing all the way , keep playing with it once you figure this out , it is to pull them out , use them , and put them away they are so good that i use them as my regular clippers , not just for traveling the case is neatly , prevents items from together and slipping out , is well made , and small enough to easily slip into a dopp kit while traveling if you get a or break a nail , they 've got you covered my only quibble is with the metal file , because personally , i think metal files rough up the nail more than file them , but every kit is like that this would also make a nice , self contained gift for someone going off to college or an overseas trip recommended sean logue , 2016
4	the fragrance of this lotion is one of those that people tend to love or hate perfumey and floral it leave your skin smelling as though you 've applied a perfume and since perfume and if someone likes the scent is such a personal preference , those who do n't like floral fragrances may find the strong scent of this lotion not to their liking i do enjoy the fragrance i go back and forth between different types of scented products , and there are times when i enjoy floral ones so this works for me i'm using on my legs right now to help get them smoothed out for the warm shorts weather soon to arrive it hydrates my skin thus giving it a smoother look and makes them feel quite nice also by using this on my legs , i do n't find the fragrance overwhelmingly strong this is n't meant for using on the face it even mentions this on the bottle it 's a body lotion it does n't mention why it 's not meant for the face , but it could be any number of things like the fragrance , that it would be an irritant if it got into the eyes , it could clog pours , etc if you enjoy bold floral fragrances and want a lotion that makes leave your skin feeling super soft and hydrated , this is a great choice
5	very soft and a little goes a long way applies smoothly and evenly on the skin , no heavy blotches especially around the lower lip of the eye i did n't have to reapply another layer to even out the so easy to use and helped with those bags under the eyes , until you caught up with your sleep my complexion is semi olive tone and this worked , but the next shade up works the best held up for full work day , no humidity under cold weather conditions
2	the pink color advertised is actually almost clear when you put it on your nails , no matter how many coats you put on i mixed it with a white polish , which helped , but you should n't have to do that do n't expect a solid color
5	this lacoste perfume has a fun light floral scent that carries well but does not linger the description is wild rose and raspberry in a detectable coconut the rose is the strongest aspect of this fragrance , to maybe 70 80 of the aroma the raspberry does not stand alone or the rose , instead it mildly a rose fragrance do n't expect to smell flowers and fruit , instead experience a more playful rose the is very , very light not anywhere near your sun tan lotion strength i apply organic coconut oil to my skin as a moisturizer and the smell of the oil \( which is already very light and not at all at perfume levels \) is greater than the coconut in this perfume rest assured you wo n't smell like or hawaiian tropic sunblock i dislike strong perfumes and colognes that are so bold that they linger long after someone has left the area to me a scent should stay on the person and offer a gentle to those in conversation or standing side by side the power of this perfume is just that
5	my best cream for dry skin
5	i do n't have sensitive skin , but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better i just completed my first shave and came away loving it the thick stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water a little goes a long way , i loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load a nice slick lather was produced i have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin after shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle it felt like menthol this might bother some but i loved it over all , 5 stars for value , ease of use , and quality of shave
5	great summer color very beachy
2	not sure this does anything not powerful and has an annoying usb charger
5	great cleanser for super sensitive skin ! dry , combination , doesnt matter this cleanser seems to work well on any skin type except maybe super oily
2	i saw this product , crepe erase , available in the amazon vine program and wanted to try it because my skin is starting to look old \( crepey \) in some areas mainly due to constant tanning when i was younger \( the product description actually states creepy looking skin in one place i assume this is a typo ! \) given the list price of this , it is not something i would likely buy myself luckily , i had the opportunity to try it free of charge the 10 oz jar is quite big if they marketed a jar about one third of the size \( and about one third of the cost \) , i think people would be more likely to try it because it would not be so cost prohibitive i was not familiar with crepe erase , so i did some reading about it on the internet crepe erase is made in the usa and is distributed by guthy renker , a marketing company that sells products to consumers through infomercials , television ads , direct mail , , e mail marketing , and the internet they use celebrity for their products jane seymour is the celebrity of crepe erase the products marketed by guthy renker are usually more expensive than similar products available at your local grocery and drug stores bottom line , the question is does crepe erase work better than other comparable products to make it worth its price \? well i have now used the product for almost two weeks while crepe erase works well as a moisturizer , i have not seen any noticeable difference in the youthfulness of my skin according to their website results can vary for each individual some users can notice visible results after the first application , while it can take others up to 60 days or longer directions state for best results to use with crepe erase exfoliating body polish , which i did not do because of the cost bottom line , based on cost and results thus far , i do not recommend this product however , i will continue using it until the jar is gone and will update my review should i notice any changes in the appearance of my skin
5	great for every day wear this is one of my go to 's
5	my favorite device of this type \( i also have an \) the device is easy to hold and pretty lightweight i like that it comes with rollers of 2 different degrees of coarseness i cannot yet speak to how fast the rollers wear out , but i have used mine 2 3 times a week for a month and they are noticeably worn yet there is a brush included for cleaning , but you can pop the whole roller cartridge off and rinse it under water for extra cleanliness batteries are included which is a nice surprise works so well , be sure to use it over a towel or paper or else you 'll have foot callus dust all over
4	i received the gold color it is a good quality product that seems to have some lasting power i like gel liner because it is more forgiving when applying than a liquid liner is the product is a thick mousse like texture and comes beautifully packaged with the right brush , you can make your eyeliner as thick or thin as you want i generally only wear black but the look with the gold color was a surprise it does have a bit of a shimmer , which i do not prefer but otherwise , it has a nice texture and very long lasting
5	work great
5	very nice makes my skin so soft
2	i bought three different colors of this dreamy looking nail polish and used them as stocking stuffers \( including my own ! \) the sheen is lovely , but the polish chips easily , and ca n't be worn without a topcoat , as even two coats wo n't stand up to normal wear and tear for even a day
5	pretty color almost like a grey and cream color i will buy this again as my go to neutral color
5	opi is all i wear
5	i first came across this hairspray from my hairstylist then i found some at super cheap so i bought a can i loved the first bottle of it , so next time i was at i bought every bottle they had , lol ! but since then i do n't know if the texture of my hair has changed or what , but i do n't like it anymore it smells great but i ended up giving all of them to my mom who does still love this ! this is the only chi hairspray i 've ever tried so i ca n't really compare it to any other hairspray they offer maybe i 'll try a firmer spray next time i want to try a chi hairspray
5	i love the smell of this perfume the scent last the whole day that i'm in the office the scent is not strong it 's very light
5	this is a great cover stick it covers easily and the edges can easily be blended into surrounding areas but here 's the one difficulty it is very difficult to pick out colors online as every computer screen is different the color i got turned out to be too dark i recommend checking the color out at a brick and mortar store before you order online
5	i am not a nail polish expert or particularly picky , but londontown 's nail polish did the job well ! it is a pretty lavender color and went on as well as my other nail polishes it also seems to be holding up well so far i read that londontown does n't test on animals , so that is a big pro to me however , i probably would n't order it again because of the price \( 16 as of now \)
5	calvin klein has done it again reveal is perfect i absolutely love it somehow the combination of pink , salt \( ! \) , floral , and then woodsy is just perfect this scent is totally unique and totally captivating it is definitely a scent that will appeal to the young , as well as the young at heart it is great for daytime as well as evening wear i appreciate that it is long lasting , and the unique design of the bottle captures the essence of the perfume perfectly ! reveal is a scent for a woman that any man will definitely appreciate enjoy !
5	i have extremely sensitive and fair skin i also have rosacea this is one of the few cleansers that has cleared up my skin and not irritated it at all although you are supposed to wipe off with a tissue , i use water it removes all my make up and is really gentle
5	this is a great face cream it goes on light and non greasy i can feel it on my skin , however what i like about this cream is how well it held my powder foundation i live in a hot and humid climate just stepping outside will cause me to break into a sweat i pat my face dry with a cloth and very little powder came off there are days when wearing makeup is a total waste of time this is a big help with keeping my color on at the end of the day , i do not feel sticky a little of this goes a long way one or two pumps gives me more than enough to cover my face and throat too bad that it is a tad bit expensive for my budget
5	i wore this color as an accent to butter london 's party the polish covers the nail really well and stays on without chipping for a good amount of time in my opinion it is worth the price you have to pay
5	best price around , beats the mall
5	scent and moisture are everything cleansers are on your skin for mere seconds i found the smell of this gel cleanser to be divine it also left my skin very soft removed my make up fairly well i have to note that i do n't wear waterproof
5	i only buy this through amazon com ! great price !
2	honestly , i really ca n't see the difference people praise this product like its a miracle cure , yet i find no from one week to the next when mentioning this to the doctor , his comment was , if you want wrinkles gone , do n't age that 's all i have to say about this product use it if you must , good luck
4	i really like the tizo sunscreens , but this one , despite being the most expensive , is not my favorite i just do n't love the way it feels going on there 's something overly slick \? about it i still use it anyway on occasion it 's tinted , but it 's not any kind of foundation the tint just prevents that weird white undertone you sometimes get with zinc sunscreen i use it under whatever makeup i'm using i have to say it does seem to moisturize my skin , and it certainly keeps me from burning , which is the most important thing as far as other anti aging effects , i'm not sure whether this does anything in that regard however , keeping the sun off your face is the most potent anti aging action you can take , so i'm gonna say this stuff does at least most of what it claims to do
5	i 've been using actual retin a \( tretinoin \) cream for several months for its anti aging properties , and when i got this retinol complex i switched to see what the difference is and evaluate whether this has actual pharmaceutical properties or is just a fancy cream i can say , after a couple weeks using this , that it definitely does pack a punch comparable to low strengths of retin a my skin tingles when i put it on , and i actually experienced a bit of mild peeling using this , which is remarkable because i hardly experience any at this point with the actual retin a it definitely does have the skin smoothing softening renewing effect you 'd expect from a potent and it feels very silky and soothing as well i'm impressed with this product
5	great polish !
5	what a great way for me to touch up my tan i like that i can add this to my natural tan this is great when i want to touch up my legs and arms this has a light scent is perfect for that extra glow i like instead of being pale overall a good product for all over tans
1	i normally love this curling iron , this one must be defective , it does not clamp shut , so therefore it does not curl properly waste of money
5	fantastic shampoo that lathers really well cleans the hair very well and light enough to use every day it wo n't take out oil based pomades with one wash , but it will take out water based pomades with a single wash leaves your hair super soft i love jack black products and this shampoo is a must have for anyone who really cares about their hair i have also tried the kiehls shampoo and this is much better in comparison my favorite shampoo !
5	beautiful and good price
4	the first thing i noticed about the product was the scent it totally brings back childhood memories of being at the barber shop the paste itself , has a smooth , thick texture until you work it with your fingers , then it becomes very pliable once the product has dried , it does a good job maintaining its hold without that hard , crusty texture common with cheaper gels the product has not irritated my skin and did not make my hair feel itchy i have relatively short hair that i style , and this product was able to provide some good volume and control , even with the random strands that like to break away compared to my favorite product hair wax it comes pretty close in performance overall , its a nice product that has a great scent and control
4	this is a pleasant , refreshing body scrub i especially like the but not be aware that it does linger if you want to smell like a fine philosophy product , great ! if you were planning to smell like something else , steer clear
5	keeps your face feeling soft and clean i 've used it for five years along with cream worth the money use twice a day moisturizes stay away from soap !
5	great product
5	i like it work great on hair make it look fuller great
1	this nail polish , although essie brand , is horrible quality i do n't know if it 's the manufacturer or the distributor , but it went on like paint thinner , no shine , chipped after a day , very flat i do not recommend
4	when you need spackle and ladies you know what i mean , this stuff is you receive a small paddle with it and you use it scoop the makeup do n't try using your fingers or a brush the foundation is brick but once it goes on your skin , it brightens , covers and blends super well wore it all day through 90 degree weather and through no touch up needed nor did it run make sure you have a heavy duty makeup remover i tried the water and it did not even touch used the it cosmetics melting balm and toner and bam , it got off
5	love the look of the nails doing a french design with this one as top color very pretty and durable
4	lovely scent and makes my hair so soft i also love the way the packaging of this looks , however it 's difficult to use in the shower
5	i used this shampoo for the first time last evening and it did actually make my hair seem fuller , more volume my beauty shop uses phyto products but i had not tried this particular shampoo previously but i will use it in the future ,
5	great product like all of both jane iredale and pca products !
5	my wife and daughter love obagi products we love this product it has a nice a nice fresh aroma , and it is rich one pump is all you need for both eye and any more is a waste you definitely do n't want to waste this product either , as it is not inexpensive obagi has a reputation for being a in the skin care industry for a reason if your eye area is in need of rich \( but not greasy \) hydration , you will love this product
1	the first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly wo n't let me return and i'm very disappointed i wo n't be buying polish off amazon again i usually love essie
5	go to polish
4	i 've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff when it comes down to it , it 's really just shaving soap this stuff is no different proraso is a very good shaving product it does n't have the variety of scents that other soaps creams have , but for the price , it 's a good low frills product the soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it , but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort it really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick it leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the nivea aftershave balm the only gripe i have is the scent i do n't particularly care for the soapy scent it 's not bad , i just would n't wear it as a cologne of course , smell is completely subjective like most all soaps , the scent does n't linger for more than a few minutes anyway overall , the soap performs great there 's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months it performs as well as tobs , but 25 less expensive
3	scent does n't last out of the shower but it smells very good while washing with it
3	i do n't like this as a cleanser it 's basically a moisturizer and leaves my skin feeling greasy
2	this is n't any good unless you 're looking for a see through polish or topcoat it 's almost completely transparent
4	after reading some reviews about redness , soreness , or even burning , i was afraid to give this to my wife , but she had no such issues it 's relatively thick , but it 's not greasy , and it goes on dry i cannot say any effects have been encountered thus far \( only a week into the experiment \) , though that includes both positive and negative effects as for the cost , well , hopefully we 'll see some significant benefits , but we 'll update this review either way 4 stars for now
4	i liked this sunscreen and it does a good job as a vine reviewer i received it at no cost but i marked it down because i consider it 's price too be excessive
5	i'm a guy and when i first tried this \( squeezed it out of the tube \) i thought as it felt like a lotion and not like a cleanser at all but i rubbed my hands together as directed and sure enough it turned into a nice foamy lather that seems to clean well \( i have slightly oily skin and many cleansers just do n't feel as though they 're really getting the job done \) i was surprised at the amount of lather \( i 'll use less from here on out \) and what a nice smell it had , in that it has a really mild scent that disappears almost immediately i was also surprised at just how it was when i rinse it off my skin feels as though every tiny bit of oil is gone and i remain surprised at just how little an amount you need to squeeze out to get a bunch of lather so i like it do i like it 25 for a 4 oz tube enough i do n't think so , but on sale i 'd probably buy it and to be fair , i might anyway , as a very small amount foams up to be far more \( and works well \) than i expected , so i keep reducing the amount i need to use , which means this may last longer than i thought i'm hoping that the 25 is an intro price and that it goes down because as i get used to it i do n't want to give it up
4	i love this spray but i'm not exactly sure what it 's for it smells amazing ! i have tried to set my makeup with it as it says you can do on the bottle and not sure how well it actually works as a makeup setter i think it also makes me break out \( but most things do \) overall , it smells amazing and is very refreshing
5	this product has a light scent to it it smells better than most acne lotions it is slightly perfumed the packaging is great it has a pump dispenser that is very easy to use and it dispenses a perfect amount it feels more like moisturizer going on than acne cream it 's more of a lotion than a cream , and it glides on , leaving skin feeling quite silky i'm sure it 's the dimethicone in it , which always does feel nice , but which usually i prefer to avoid it is widely considered a very safe ingredient , but i find it can cause some dryness , which , in a product like this , might be a good side effect for some the active ingredient is salicylic acid , 1 5 which is found in a lot of anti acne products i do like that it has been doing a great job of keeping my skin from shining with the season change , my skin has been especially oily , and using this product , my skin has stayed looking healthy and fairly matte if you 've used smashbox 's , it leaves skin looking and feeling similiar it says to use it 2 3 times a day after i applied it twice , without any makeup on , or other skincare products , i did get some piling it works much better to wash my face before each application the directions do say to do that , but i , being me , sometimes have to figure things out for myself with clean skin , there 's no piling problem i 've had a of small tiny zits like i sprayed something on my face that did n't quite agree with it \? after starting to use this , the area quit spreading , and in 3 days , it was completely cleared i'm rating this a 5 , forgiving it for the dimethicone , because i love the way it makes my skin look it really minimizes and blurs pores and gives skin such a nice matte look i 've bought cosmetic products that have a similar effect , and they are priced much higher for a smaller amount , and do n't have the acne fighting benefit
5	got a lot of compliments polish is naturally chip resistant good brand of polish , opi is my other fav , this is the first time i tried essie now i am open to essie as well as opi \( tip learned from my manicurist that the essie sold in drug stores with white lettering on the bottle is not the real essie beware \)
2	i love the sensual fragrance of ritual of ayurveda \( indian rose and sweet almond oil \) but getting it to dispense properly and in small amounts is a real pain the button is very hard to i finally do get it to work , it way more than i need per shower or bath there 's enough foam to wash my entire body \( and probably someone else \) and i still have enough left over to shave my legs not exactly economical to make it even worse , the bottle is a mess after the foam comes be rinsed off after each use this dispenser needs to go back to the drawing board as much as i like the fragrance , the hard to use cap and messy distribution is enough to make me not get it again
3	dries out my lips
5	i love this hampton sun spf 15 super hydrating face cream as a daily moisturizer i do n't mind the low spf of 15 since i'm usually at home during the day when i'm going to be out in the sunshine i can use something with a higher spf number it feels so light , not heavy or greasy and works well under makeup it does help to cut down on redness and has really made my skin feel so soft you do n't need to use a lot so there 's no need to lather it on like i 've had to do with some skin care products there 's hardly any scent to this product and i appreciate that well worth the price
4	elta makes such good products i adore their facial sunscreen this is great for me in summer for winter i need something a little more hydrating
5	i love this oil it goes on light and easily spreads it gives moisture without feeling weighed down or greasy i am big on light moisturizer due to not liking the feeling of thick cremes i highly suggest this !
